V.V. SOLIVEN REALTY CORP., PETITIONER, VS. LUIS KUNG BENG T. ONG., RESPONDENT.




CARPIO, J.:


Before this Court is a petition for review
[1]
 to set aside the 17 January 2001 Decision
[2]

 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 58391. The Court of Appeals 
denied the petition of V.V. Soliven Realty Corp. assailing the decision 
of the Office of the President. The Office of the President upheld the 
Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board ordering V.V. Soliven Realty Corp.
 to execute a deed of absolute sale of a parcel of land, which Luis Kung
 Beng T. Ong purchased, and to refund P3,744.96 representing his excess 
payment.
The Facts
On 18 July 1979, petitioner V.V. Soliven Realty Corp. (âpetitionerâ),
[3]
 and respondent Luis Kung Beng T. Ong (ârespondentâ)
[4]

 signed a Contract to Sell covering Lot No. 28, Block No. 7, Phase VIII,
 Pasig Green Park Village, Pasig City (âlotâ).  The contract price of 
the lot was P45,320 with down payment of P6,798. The balance was payable
 within 10 years with monthly installments of P552.79.
On 20 July
 1989, after 10 years from the signing of the Contract to Sell, 
respondent paid a total amount of P77,987.76 representing his down 
payment, monthly installments and payment for MERALCO shares.
Despite
 respondentâs full payment of the purchase price, petitioner failed and 
refused to execute the deed of absolute sale and to deliver to 
respondent the certificate of title over the lot.
On 4 April 
1990, respondent filed a letter-complaint with the Housing and Land Use 
Regulatory Board (âHLURBâ) praying for the delivery of the certificate 
of title over the lot and the refund of his excess payment.
Petitioner
 denied respondentâs allegation of full payment of the purchase price of
 the lot and the excess payment on the amortization.
After 
hearing, the HLURBâs Office of Arbitration, Adjudication and Legal 
Affairs (âOAALAâ) found that respondent had already fully paid the 
purchase price of the lot and that he had an excess payment of 
P3,744.96.
[5]
   The dispositive portion of the Decision dated 5 December 1990 of the OAALA reads:
PREMISES CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:
1.
 Ordering [petitioner] to execute a deed of sale in favor of the 
[respondent] preparatory to the issuance of title for the lot in dispute
 within 30 days from finality hereof;
2. Directing same 
[petitioner] to refund [respondent] of his overpayment amounting to 
P3,744.96 within the aforesaid period as in the preceding paragraph.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
[6]
Petitioner filed a petition for review with the HLURB Board of Commissioners which affirmed 
in toto
 the decision of the OAALA.
[7]
Thereafter,
 petitioner appealed the decision of the HLURB Board of Commissioners to
 the Office of the President.  Petitioner claimed that respondent had 
âno cause of action because the subject lot was levied [on] execution in
 connection with Civil Case No. Q-42625,
[8]
 hence the same should be deemed lost through fortuitous event.â
Unknown
 to respondent, the lot was levied on execution on 2 July    1985 in 
Civil Case No. Q-42625.  Subsequently, a certificate of sale was 
annotated on the certificate of title.  However, petitioner was able to 
redeem the lot on 12 November 1999.
Before its redemption, 
petitioner subdivided the lot into two. Consequently, the certificate of
 title to the lot, Transfer Certificate of Title (âTCTâ) No. 503974, was
 cancelled and two certificates of title were issued, TCT Nos. 654466 
and 654467, consisting of 103 square meters each. On 13 March 2000, 
petitioner sold the property covered by TCT No. 654467 to a certain 
Rogelio Vizon Carpio, Jr. for P350,000.
Meanwhile, the Office of 
the President dismissed petitionerâs appeal on 22 February 2000 and 
affirmed the decision of the HLURB Board of Commissioners.
Thereafter,
 petitioner filed a petition with the Court of Appeals questioning the 
decision of the Office of the President.  Petitioner reiterated its 
argument that the lot should be considered lost when it was levied on 
execution in Civil Case No. Q-42625.  Petitioner further claimed that it
 could no longer transfer ownership to respondent because the title to 
the lot was already transferred to Rogelio Vizon Carpio, Jr. who was a 
buyer in good faith. Petitioner insisted that respondentâs cause of 
action be converted to a claim for refund of payments.
The Court of Appeals denied the petition and disposed as follows:
WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED, and we hereby condemn the petitioner, thusly â
1)
 To return to respondent the sum of P350,000.00 plus legal interest 
reckoned from the commencement of the complaint, representing the value 
of the 103 square meters lot sold to Rogelio Vizon Carpio, Jr.;
2)
 To execute a Deed of Absolute Sale over the remaining 103 square meters
 covered by TCT No. 654466 and to deliver the title thereof to the 
respondent, now his heirs;
3) To refund of (sic) the sum of 
P3,744.96 plus interest at the legal rate, reckoned from the date of the
 institution of the complaint in this case;
4) To pay respondent, now his heirs, the sum of P300,000.00 for exemplary and moral damages;
5) To pay the sum of P50,000.00 as attorneyâs fees.
Costs against petitioners (
sic
).
SO ORDERED.
[9]
Hence, this petition.
The Court of Appealsâ Ruling
The
 Court of Appeals rejected petitionerâs contention that the lot should 
be deemed lost when it was levied on execution in Civil Case No. 
Q-42625.  There is no evidence that petitioner had lost its right of 
redemption and that the title to the lot had been transferred to a buyer
 in good faith on 
18 July 1979
, the date of perfection of the sale. Therefore, petitioner could not invoke Article 1262
[10]
 of the Civil Code.
The
 Court of Appeals awarded respondent P300,000 as moral and exemplary 
damages.  The Court of Appeals based the award on petitionerâs willful 
and unlawful failure to deliver the title to the lot upon respondentâs 
full payment of the purchase price.  The Court of Appeals further opined
 that in insisting with its theory of extinguishment of obligation due 
to the loss of the thing sold, petitioner acted contrary to morals, good
 customs and public policy.  The Court of Appeals also noted that 
respondent died at a relatively young age of 52 due to hypertension, 
without obtaining the title to the lot.
The Court of Appeals also
 awarded respondent P50,000 as attorneyâs fees because he was âcompelled
 to litigate to vindicate his rights    and interests which petitioner 
had wantonly trampled [upon].â
The Issues
Petitioner raises the following issues for resolution:
THE
 COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AWARDING DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYâS FEES WHEN THE
 SAME WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY PRAYED FOR IN THE COMPLAINT.  EVEN GRANTING 
THAT THERE WAS A PRAYER FOR DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYâS FEES, RESPONDENT 
FAILED TO FURNISH SUFFICIENT BASIS FOR [SUCH] AWARD.
THE
 COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE COMPUTATION OF THE LEGAL 
INTEREST ON THE PURCHASE PRICE OF ONE-HALF OF THE LOT TO BE REFUNDED TO 
THE RESPONDENT SHOULD COMMENCE FROM THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT AND NOT 
FROM THE DATE OF THE SECOND SALE.
[11]
The Courtâs Ruling
The petition is meritorious.
Petitioner
 no longer questions the part of the Court of Appealsâ decision ordering
 petitioner to execute a deed of absolute sale in favor of respondent 
and to deliver the title covering the remaining 103 square meters of the
 lot.  Petitioner also accepts the Court of Appealsâ directive to pay 
respondent P350,000, representing the selling price of one-half of the 
lot.  Petitioner also agrees to pay respondent P3,754.96, including 
interest, representing respondentâs excess payment.
Therefore, 
this petition mainly concerns the award of damages and attorneyâs fees 
and the commencement of the computation of the interest on the P350,000 
due to respondent.
On the award of damages and attorneyâs fees
Petitioner
 faults the Court of Appeals for awarding damages and attorneyâs fees to
 respondent.  Petitioner contends that respondent failed to allege in 
the complaint or in the position paper filed with the HLURB his claim 
for damages and attorneyâs fees.
Assuming respondent claimed for 
damages and attorneyâs fees, petitioner argues that there was no basis 
for such award.  No bad faith is allegedly attributable to petitioner.  
Petitioner claims that its president redeemed the lot in the execution 
sale for the sole purpose of delivering the title to respondent.  
However, the petitionerâs sales officers sold the other half of the lot 
to Rogelio Vizon Carpio, Jr. without their presidentâs knowledge.  
Moreover, petitionerâs president offered respondentâs heirs another lot,
 as a compromise, on learning of the decision of the Office of the 
President.
True, respondent failed to allege specifically in the 
complaint his claim for damages and attorneyâs fees.  This lack of 
specific allegation is understandable because no counsel assisted 
respondent at the time. It was only when the instant case reached the 
Court of Appeals when respondentâs substitute (Ma. Dolores T. Ong), who 
was already represented by counsel,
[12]
 expressly pleaded for damages and attorneyâs fees.
Respondentâs substitute attached an affidavit
[13]
  
  (âaffidavitâ) to her comment to the petition before the Court of 
Appeals stating that respondentâs death was âpartly due to the stress, 
frustration over the lot as he had suffered sleepless nights, mental 
anguish and anxiety.â  The affidavit further stated that âpetitioner has
 caused [her] family great anxiety, mental anguish and injury.â
However,
 respondentâs substitute insists that respondent prayed for damages in 
the complaint and position paper filed with the HLURB.  Respondentâs 
substitute cites the following statements in the complaint and position 
paper to support her claim for moral damages.
This is to 
advise your good office, the pains and sufferings that my family and I 
are undergoing, due to the refusal and failure to release the Transfer 
Certificate of Title to the lot that I have already fully paid last July
 20, 1989. 
xxx
[14]
8.
 That [respondent] will file and ask for an additional damages amounting
 to not less than P500,000.00 but not more than P2,000,000.00 Philippine
 currency if the above entitled case will not be resolved this year 
1990.
[15]
Although
 the statements in the complaint, position paper and affidavit would 
suffice as a claim for damages, neither respondent nor his heirs as 
substitutes adequately proved their entitlement to moral damages.  Mere 
allegation is not proof.
[16]
 It is elementary that to recover moral damages, there must be 
pleading and proof
 of moral suffering, mental anguish, fright and the like.
[17]
Nevertheless,
 this Court can award nominal damages to respondentâs heirs.  Nominal 
damages are not intended for indemnification of loss suffered but for 
the 
vindication or recognition of a right violated or invaded
.
[18]
 Nominal damages are recoverable where the plaintiff has suffered some injury the amount of which the evidence fails to show.
[19]
 The court has the discretion to assess the nominal damages according to the circumstances of the case.
[20]
There is no question that petitioner failed to comply with its statutory
[21]
 and contractual
[22]

 obligation of delivering the title to the lot within a reasonable time 
upon respondentâs full payment of the purchase price. The Court notes 
that respondent bought the lot from petitioner on 18 July 1979, and paid
 in full his installments on 20 July 1989.  However, petitioner failed 
to deliver the title to the lot because it was then levied on 
execution.  Hence, petitioner could no longer deliver the title then.
However,
 instead of delivering the title to respondent in 1999 after redeeming 
the lot in the execution sale, petitioner subdivided the lot into two 
and sold the other half to another buyer. Petitionerâs claim that its 
president redeemed the lot purposely to deliver the title to respondent 
is self-serving.  And petitionerâs allegation that its sales officers 
sold the other half of the lot to another buyer without its presidentâs 
knowledge is immaterial.  Besides, petitionerâs offer of a larger lot to
 respondentâs heirs came rather too late.  Petitioner offered the 
property upon the rendition of the decision of the Office of the 
President, or after almost a decade from the filing of the complaint.  
Respondent died during the pendency of the case without obtaining the 
title to the lot.   The Court views an award of P100,000 in nominal 
damages fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
Since respondent failed to show that he is entitled to moral damages, the Court of Appeals erred in awarding exemplary damages.
[23]
The
 Court also sets aside the award of attorneyâs fees for lack of basis.  
The amount of attorneyâs fees recoverable as actual damages is subject 
to judicial discretion. However, it must have some factual, legal and 
equitable bases. It cannot be left to speculation and conjectures.
[24]
On the computation of interest
The
 Court sustains petitionerâs argument that the legal interest on the 
P350,000 due to respondent should commence from the date when one-half 
of the lot was sold to Rogelio Vizon Carpio, Jr., and not from the 
filing of the complaint. There is no basis to compute the interest from 
the filing of the complaint because petitionerâs obligation to pay 
P350,000 arose only at the time of the second sale.  Moreover, there is 
no evidence that the value of one-half of the lot was already P350,000 
when the complaint was filed.
However, respondent is entitled to 
legal interest on the value of one-half of the lot from the filing of 
the complaint on 4 April 1990 until the sale of one-half of the lot on 
13 March 2000.  For this purpose, the value of one-half of the lot is 
50% of the P77,987.76 total payment respondent made to petitioner.  As 
of 13 March 2000, this legal interest had accumulated to P23,279.35.
[25]
WHEREFORE,
 the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 17 January 2001 in CA-G.R. SP No. 58391 is 
AFFIRMED

 with modification. The award of moral and exemplary damages and 
attorneyâs fees is deleted. However, the Court awards nominal damages of
 P100,000 to respondent.  The Court also awards respondent P23,279.35, 
the accumulated legal interest as of 13 March 2000.  The legal interest 
on the P350,000 to be paid by petitioner to respondent shall commence on
 13 March 2000.  The Court affirms the assailed decision in all other 
respects.  Costs against petitioner.
SO ORDERED.

 In the Contract to Sell, however, the vendor is Solid Homes, Inc.

 This should be P3,754.96.  The computation made by respondent shows that he overpaid petitioner the amount of P3,754.96.
