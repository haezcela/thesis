ISIDRA VDA. DE VICTORIA SUBSTITUTED BY MARIO VICTORIA, PETITIONER, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, HON. JUANITA T. GUERRERO, PRESIDING JUDGE OF REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 37, CALAMBA, LAGUNA; HON. FLORENCIO P. BUESER, PRESIDING JUDGE, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, CALAUAN, LAGUNA; EX-OFFICIO SHERIFF â REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, CALAMBA, LAGUNA AND/OR HIS DEPUTIES; SPOUSES LUIS GIBE AND ZENAIDA GIBE AND ALL PERSONS ACTING ON THEIR BEHALF, RESPONDENTS. 
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


Through his appeal by certiorari,
[1]
 petitioner Mario Victoria seeks to set aside the Resolutions of the Court of Appeals promulgated on May 25, 2000 and July 12, 2000, which (1) dismissed petitionerâs special civil action for certiorari
[2]
 and (2) denied petitionerâs motion for reconsideration, respectively.
The antecedents of the case are as follows:
On October 27, 1993, respondent spouses Luis and Zenaida Gibe filed a Complaint for âEjectment and Damages with a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunctionâ 
[3]
 against Isidra Vda. de Victoria (the mother of herein petitioner Mario Victoria), Eusebio Arida, Juan Becina and Guillermo Becina with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Calauan, Laguna, docketed as Civil Case No. 261 (the Ejectment Case). In their Complaint, the Gibe spouses alleged, among other things, the following:
1. In 1992 they acquired a parcel of land (the property) from the heirs of the late Judge Gregorio Lantin, designated as Lot 1-B-153-A with an area of approximately 27,064 square meters (sq. m.).
2. The property was originally part of Lot 1-B-153 with an area of approximately 34,829 sq. m., which was subdivided into seven parcels in 1989 among Judge Lantin and four of his tenants as follows:
  
Lot No.

Total Area

Felix Victoria, now deceased, was the husband of Isidra Victoria.  All the defendants in the Ejectment Case, as former tenants, were given home lots, while Lot 1-B-153-A which was allotted to Gregorio Lantin was sold to the spouses Gibe.
3. In the course of fencing Lot 1-B-153-A, it was discovered that the Victoria house was standing on the northwestern portion of the property; that Mrs. Victoria was harvesting and picking fruits from the citrus trees    planted in that area without the knowledge and permission of the Gibe spouses; and that Eusebio Arida, Juan Becina and Guillermo Becina were also surreptitiously planting palay on the northwestern portion.
4. The fencing was discontinued after the children of Mrs. Victoria threatened to shoot at the workers of the Gibe spouses with an armalite rifle, leaving approximately 8,000 sq. m. of the northwestern portion of Lot 1-B-153-A open and unfenced.
In her Answer (With Motion to Dismiss),
[4]
 Mrs. Victoria denied having entered Judge Lantinâs lot alleged to have been purchased by the spouses Gibe, claiming that her farmhouse was constructed on the very lot awarded to her family by the DAR. Moving thus for the dismissal of the Ejectment Case for lack of cause of action, she interposed a counterclaim praying that, as a tenant of Judge Lantin, she be maintained in the peaceful possession and cultivation of her lot or, in the alternative, awarded disturbance compensation; and, in either event, reimbursed for the expenses she incurred as a result of the Ejectment Case.
At the Preliminary Conference of the Ejectment Case, the parties mutually agreed to a relocation survey of the property to be conducted by a geodetic engineer.
After the court-appointed geodetic engineer had submitted the results of the relocation survey, Mrs. Victoria and her co-defendants in the Ejectment Case filed a Manifestation with Motion
[5]
 requesting the trial court to allow them to engage the services of an independent surveyor, at their expense, to conduct another survey. Although the motion was granted, no resulting survey plan was, however, submitted by them.
By Decision of May 21, 1998, the MTC, finding in favor of the plaintiffs-spouses Gibe, disposed as follows:
WHEREFORE in the light of the foregoing, this Court on the basis of the evidences [sic], the [sic] mutually submitted before it by both the plaintiffs and the defendants, this Court has to rule as follows:
1. That since it clearly appeared that 
the
 
plaintiffs
 
are
 
the
 
real
 
owners
 
of
 
the
 
real
 
property
 
with
 
an
 
area
 
of
 
27,064
 
square
 
meters
, 
including
 
the
 
real
 
property
 
with
 
an
 
area
 
of
 
5,825
 
square
 
meters
 
which
 
is
 
in
 
possession
 
of
 
all
 
the
 
defendants
, they have the absolute right to obtain the proper possession thereof and to eject all of them thru legal means;
2. That in as much as all the defendants are at present and also    the real owners of the real properties and also in the possession thereof as evidence[d] by their respective emancipation patents, each of them is hereby 
ordered
 
by
 
this
 
Court
 
to
 
properly
 
and
 
absolutely
 
abandoned
 [
sic
] 
the
 
portions
 
of
 
the
 
real
 
property
 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-140417 and immediately delivered its possession to the plaintiffs;
3. That considering the 
possession
 
of
 
the
 
defendant
 
Isidra
 
Vda.
 
de
 
Victoria
 
of
 
the
 
real
 
properties
 
with
 
a
 
total
 
area
 
of
 
1,508
 
square
 
meters
 
which
 
she
 
did
 
not
 
own
, [
she
]  
is
  ordered 
by
 
this
 
Court
 
to
 
pay
 
and
 
remit
 
to
 
the
 
above
 
plaintiffs
 
the
 
sum
 
of
 
P45,000.00
 
as reasonable
 
compensation
 
for
 
the
 
use
 and occupation of the portion above mentioned as it belong[s] to the plaintiffs and the defendant Becina together with two other defendants Juan and Arida are in possession of the real property owned by the plaintiffs with an area of 4,327 square meters, they are hereby ordered [to] jointly pay the plaintiffs the sum of P50,000.00 jointly as reasonable compensation.
4. That all the defendants are hereby ordered to pay the counsel for the plaintiffs the sum of P20,000.00 jointly as attorneyâs fees;
5. That in view of failure of the plaintiffs to prove their entitlement to preliminary mandatory injunction and to the set the same for hearing as required by law, the same is hereby denied.
6. The defendants are hereby ordered to pay the costs of suit.
SO ORDERED.
[6]
    (Underscoring supplied)
On May 22, the spouses Gibe, without notice to the defendants in the Ejectment Case, filed a Motion for Immediate Execution and Demolition
[7]
 praying that âa writ of execution be issued to enforce and satisfy the judgment, for the ejectment and demolition of the house of the Defendants.â
Eight days after promulgation and receipt of the MTC decision or on May 29, 1998, the defendants in the Ejectment Case filed a Notice of Appeal
[8]
 without, however, filing a supersedeas bond to stay the immediate execution of the decision and depositing monthly rentals.
By Order of June 1, 1998,
[9]
 the MTC granted the Motion for Immediate Execution and Demolition and accordingly issued a Writ of Execution.
[10]
A Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition (With Prayer for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order [TRO] and a Writ of Preliminary Injunction)
[11]
 was filed on July 13, 1998 with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Calamba, Laguna, docketed as Civil Case No. 2625-98-C (the Petition for Certiorari).
The Petition assailed the MTC Decision, its Order of June 1, 1998, and the Writ of Execution, contending that the MTC had no jurisdiction over the Ejectment Case and committed grave abuse of discretion in deciding the case in favor of the spouses Gibe and in issuing the said Order and Writ of Execution pending appeal.
[12]
Mrs. Victoria, it turned out, had passed away shortly before the MTC promulgated its May 21, 1998 Decision. Her son, petitioner Mario Victoria, thus substituted for her.
[13]
Branch 37 of the RTC Calauan, to which the Petition for Certiorari was raffled, issued a Writ of Preliminary Injunction.
[14]
In the meantime, the appeal filed by the defendants in the Ejectment Case before the RTC of Calauan, Laguna was dismissed by Branch 92 thereof by Order of October 7, 1998
[15]
 for failure to file their appeal memorandum.
[16]
By its Decision dated August 13, 1999,
[17]
 the RTC dismissed the Petition for Certiorari in light of the following ratiocination:
The petitioner contends that the lower court has no jurisdiction to try the case and to issue the questioned decision because the subject parcels of land have been subjected and covered by P.D. 27 known as Operation Land Transfer and any dispute involving said lands must be referred to the Honorable Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) for proper disposition.
Jurisdiction
 
of
 
a
 
court
 
is
 
determined
 
by
 
the
 
allegations
 
in
 
the
 
complaint
. The complaint filed by the private respondents was for Ejectment and Damages With a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction. Ejectment proceedings are within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the    Municipal Trial Court.
x x x
The Answer and the Position Paper of the petitioner Victoria in the case below show that she claimed ownership over the portion of the lot, by virtue of the Operation Land Transfer, which the private respondents Gibe alleged to have been occupied by the farm house of the petitioner. 
Petitioner
 
Victoria
 
did
 
not
 
question
 
the
 
jurisdiction
 
of
 
the
 
Court
 
but
 
prayed
 
for
 
the
 
dismissal
 
of
 
the
 
case
 
below
 
for
 
lack
 
of
 
cause
 
of
 
action
. So much so, that when the respondent Court took into consideration the issue of ownership over    the portion of the property allegedly transgressed, it did so only to determine who is better entitled to possession over said portion. And when it ordered the resurvey of the property to determine its actual boundaries and the admission of the Engineerâs report to aid it in the issuance of the questioned decision. It did not determine the question of ownership, i.e. as to who the real owner is which the petitioner may do so in a separate complaint before the proper forum.
x x x
The
 
Decision
 
of
 
the
 
Court
 
below
 
is
 
therefore
 
not
 
an
 
error
 
of
 
jurisdiction
 
but
 
an
 
error
 
of
 
judgment
 
which
 
is
 
not
 
reviewable
 
by
 
certiorari
 
proceedings
. In other words, certiorari is a remedy designed for the correction of errors of jurisdiction and not errors of judgment as its function is to keep and inferior court within its jurisdiction.
Having found [the MTC] to have jurisdiction to issue the decision dated May 28, 1998,
 the
 
respondent
 
judge
 
likewise
 
has
 
jurisdiction
 
to
 
direct
 
the
 
execution
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
pending
 
appeal
 pursuant to Section 19, Rule 70 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.
[18]
 (Underscoring supplied)
Herein petitioner, Mario Victoria, received a copy of the foregoing Decision of the RTC on September 18, 1999 and filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the same on September 28, 1999.
[19]
 In due course, the RTC denied petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration by Order dated December 7, 1999.
[20]
On March 28, 2000, petitioner instituted another special civil action for certiorari, this time with the Court of Appeals (CA), questioning both the August 13, 1999 Decision of the RTC and the May 21, 1998 Decision of the MTC with prayer for the issuance of a TRO and/or a Writ of Preliminary Injunction.
[21]
 This case was docketed as C.A. G.R. S.P. No. 47964 (the CA Certiorari Petition).
By Resolution of May 25, 2000,
[22]
 the CA dismissed the CA Certiorari Petition in this wise:
The petition is flawed for the following reasons 
viz:
1. 
The
 
correct
 
remedy
 
from
 
a
 
decision
 
of
 
a
 
Regional
 
Trial
 
Court
 
in
 
a
 
petition
 
for
 
certiorari
 
is
 
an
 
ordinary
 
appeal
 pursuant to Section 1, Rule 41 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure and section 5, Rule 6 of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals;
2. 
The
 
instant
 
petition
 
is
 
filed
 
out of
 
time
. The assailed RTC decision was received on September 18, 1999 while the Motion for Reconsideration was filed on September 28, 1999. (
Rollo
 P. 152). Thus a period of nine (9) days had elapsed. The Order dated December 7, 1999 was received by petitioner on January 29, 2000 while the instant petition was filed only on March 28, 2000. Thus a period of fifty eight (58) days had passed. Hence, petitioner had consumed a period of 67 days, well beyond the 60-day period allowed by the rules as amended by Supreme Court En Banc resolution dated July 21, 1998.
[23]
 Plainly, the petition was filed out of time.
3. The 
statement
 
of
 
material
 
dates
 
as
 
to
 
timeliness
 
of
 
the
 
filing
 
of
 
the
 
petition
 
is
 
incomplete
 as it failed to state when the motion for reconsideration was filed in violation of Section 3, Rule 46.
WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED.
SO ORDERED.
[24]
Petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration
[25]
 having been denied by the CA by Resolution of July 12, 2000
[26]
 for being filed 2 days beyond the reglementary period, he filed the petition at bar after he was granted, on his motion, an extension of thirty days to file the petition, conditioned upon the timeliness of the motion for extension.
[27]
Petitioner anchored his petition on the following grounds:
PUBLIC RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF OR IN [
sic
] EXCESS OF JURISDICTION BY NOT GIVING DUE COURSE TO THE PETITIONERâS PETITION FOR CERTIORARI ON GROUND OF TECHNICALITY INSTEAD OF RESOLVING THE CASE ON THE MERITS.
PUBLIC RESPONDENT REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF CALAMBA, LAGUNA, COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF OR IN [sic] EXCESS OF JURISDICTION BY RULING THAT THIS CASE FALLS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, AND THAT THE DECISION OF THE COURT A QUO WAS NOT AN ERROR [OF] JURISDICTION BUT AN ERROR OF JUDGMENT WHICH IS NOT REVIEWABLE IN CERTIORARI [P]ROCEEDINGS.
[28]
The appeal must be denied.
As earlier noted, this Court granted petitioner an extended period to file the petition, conditioned, however, 
on
 
the
 
timeliness
 of the filing of the Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review on Certiorari. It is a basic rule of remedial law that a motion for extension of time must be filed before the expiration of the period sought to be extended.
[29]
 Where a motion for extension of time is filed beyond the period for appeal, the same is of no effect since there would no longer be any period to extend, and the judgment or order to be appealed from will have become final and executory.
[30]
In the case at bar, an examination of the records reveals that the 
reglementary
 
period
 
to
 
appeal
 
had
 
in
 
fact
 
expired
 
almost
 
10
 
months
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
filing
 
of
 
petitionerâs
 
motion
 
for
 
extension
 
of
 
time
 
on
 
April
 
10,
 
2001
. The Registry Return Receipt
[31]
 of the Resolution of the CA dismissing the CA Certiorari Petition shows that the same was received by counsel for petitionerâs agent on June 5, 2000. Hence, petitioner had only until June 20, 2000 within which to file an appeal or a motion for new trial or reconsideration.
[32]
Clearly, the Court of Appeals committed no error when it denied petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration for having been filed two days after the expiration of the reglementary period on June 22, 2000.
Similarly, the instant petition for review must likewise be denied for having been filed on May 12, 2001, almost 11 months after the expiration of the period to appeal on June 20, 2000.
[33]
In fact, a closer inspection of the records indicates that this case should have been terminated as early as January 4, 2000 with the lapse of the period within which petitioner could have appealed from the RTC Decision.
By his own account, petitioner received a copy of the Decision of the RTC dismissing the Petition for Certiorari on September 18, 1999 and filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the same on September 28, 1999. As correctly pointed out by the CA, by that time a period of 9 days had already elapsed.
[34]
 Thus, upon receipt of the notice of the denial of the motion for reconsideration, which was admitted to be on December 29, 1999,
[35]
 
petitioner
 
only
 
had
 
6
 
days
 
or
 
until
 
January
 
4,
 
2000
[36]
 within which to file a 
notice
 
of
 
appeal
.
However, petitioner failed to do so, and he instead, 
on
 
March
 
28,
 
2000
, filed a 
petition
 
for
 
certiorari
 
under
 
Rule
 
65
 with the Court of Appeals. As the Court of Appeals again correctly pointed out, â[t]he correct remedy from a decision of a Regional Trial Court in a petition for certiorari is an ordinary appeal pursuant to Section 1, Rule 41 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure xxx.â It is well settled that the perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period permitted by law is not only mandatory, but also jurisdictional.
[37]
 Certiorari is not and cannot be made a substitute for an appeal where the latter remedy is available but was lost through fault or negligence.
[38]
To be sure, petitioner has regularly invoked, before this Court and the lower courts, the policy in favor of a liberal interpretation of the Rules of Procedure.
Apropos
 on this point are this Courtâs observations in
 Duremdes v. Duremdes
:
[39]
Although it has been said time and again that litigation is not a game of technicalities, that every case must be prosecuted in accordance with the prescribed procedure so that issues may be properly presented and justly resolved, 
this does not mean that procedural rules may altogether be disregarded. Rules of procedure must be faithfully followed
 except only when, for persuasive reasons, they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed procedure. 
Concomitant to a liberal application of the rules of procedure should be an effort on the part of the party invoking liberality to adequately explain his failure to abide by the rules.
[40]
 (Emphasis supplied; italics in the original; citations omitted)
In the case at bar, petitioner has not provided any cogent explanation that would absolve him of the consequences of his repeated failure to abide by the rules.
Moreover, petitionerâs principal substantive argument that the Ejectment Case properly falls within the jurisdiction of the DARAB and not of the MTC is without merit.
The MTC does not automatically lose its exclusive original jurisdiction over ejectment cases by the mere allegation of a tenancy relationship. As thoroughly discussed in 
Rivera v. Santiago
,
[41]
 the party alleging tenancy must prove the existence of all the essential requisites of tenancy in order to oust the MTC of its jurisdiction over the case:
Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint. That is basic. Unquestionably, petitioner lodged an action for ejectment before the MTC. Under BP 129, the allegations in the complaint conferred initiatory jurisdiction on that first level court.
x x x
However, when tenancy is averred as a defense and is shown 
prima facie
 to be the real issue, the MTC must dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. Under RA 6657, it is the DAR that has authority to hear and decide when tenancy is legitimately involved.
In the instant case, respondents averred tenancy as an affirmative and/or special defense in their Answer with Counterclaim. Under the RSP [Revised Rule on Summary Procedure], the MTC was supposed to conduct a preliminary conference to determine if such relationship was indeed the real issue. 
We emphasize that 
the
 
MTC
 
did
 
not
 
automatically
 
lose
 
its
 
jurisdiction
 
simply
 
because
 
respondents
 
raised
 
tenancy
 
as
 
a
 
defense
. It continued to have the authority to hear the case precisely to determine whether it had jurisdiction to dispose of the ejectment suit on its merits
.
x x x
An agrarian dispute refers to any controversy relating to, 
inter alia
, tenancy over lands devoted to agriculture. To determine whether the CA was correct in its reversal of the trial court, it is necessary to keep in mind 
the essential requisites of tenancy which are as follows:
1) The parties are the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee;
(2) The subject of the relationship is agricultural land;
(3) There is mutual consent to the tenancy between the parties;
(4) The purpose of the relationship is agricultural production;
(5) There is personal cultivation by the tenant or agricultural lessee; and
(6) There is a sharing of harvests between the parties.
All these elements must concur. It is not enough that they are alleged; 
to
 
divest
 
the
 
MTC
 
of
 
jurisdiction,
 they 
must
 
all
 
be
 
shown
 
to
 
be
 
present.
 x x x
[42]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; italics in the original; citations omitted)
In 
Duremdes v. Duremdes,
[43]
 where a similar argument was raised under factual circumstances analogous to the case at bar, this Court held:
First.
 
For the DARAB to have jurisdiction over the case, there must be a tenancy relationship between the parties. In order for a tenancy agreement to take hold over a dispute it is essential to establish all its indispensable elements, to wit:
1) [T]hat the parties are the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee; 2) that the subject matter of the relationship is an agricultural land; 3) that there is consent between the parties to the relationship; 4) that the purpose of the relationship is to bring about agricultural production; 5) that there is personal cultivation on the part of the tenant or agricultural lessee; and 6) that the harvest is shared between the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee.
Second.
 The trial court found that no such tenancy agreement existed between the respondent and Herminio Tara, and that such allegation was a mere ploy to prevent the respondent from exercising dominion and ownership over the subject property. This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. We find no cogent reason to reverse such finding.
Third.
 
The petitioner is barred from raising the issue of jurisdiction. The petitioner actively participated in all stages of the instant case, setting up a counterclaim and asking for affirmative relief in his answer. He failed, however, to question the courtâs jurisdiction over the suit. After relying on the jurisdiction of the regular courts, he cannot be permitted to turn around and question it.
 It is not right for a party who has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction of a court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative relief, to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction.
[44]
 (Emphasis supplied; italics in the original; citations omitted)
In the present case, neither petitioner nor his predecessor-in-interest submitted evidence to substantiate the existence of the essential requisites of tenancy. Thus, there is no basis at all to support petitionerâs claim that the MTC was without jurisdiction to render the questioned Decision.
What is more, as in 
Duremdes
 and unlike in 
Rivera
, petitionerâs predecessor-in-interest never questioned the jurisdiction of the MTC. Instead, she based her prayer for the dismissal of the Ejectment Case on respondentsâ alleged lack of cause of action; with a counterclaim praying that she be maintained in the peaceful possession and cultivation of the subject property or, in the alternative, awarded disturbance compensation; and, in either event, reimbursed for the expenses she incurred. Considering that petitionerâs predecessor-in-interest actively participated in the proceedings before the MTC and invoked its jurisdiction to secure an affirmative relief, petitioner cannot now turn around and question that courtâs jurisdiction.
Finally, this Court notes with consternation petitionerâs attempts, with the aid of his counsel, Atty. Abdul A. Basar, to deliberately mislead this Court as to the material dates and status of the decision appealed from, thereby impeding if not frustrating the ends of justice.
In his Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review on Certiorari, petitioner declared under oath that: (1) he had âfiled a timely Motion for Reconsiderationâ of the CA Resolution dismissing his petition for certiorari, and (2) the notice of the denial by the CA of his Motion for Reconsideration âwas received by petitioner only [on] March 28, 2001,â thus making it appear that he had until April 12, 2001 within which to perfect his appeal.
Significantly, petitioner did not disclose, either in his motion for extension of time or in his subsequent petition, the date on which he received the Resolution of the CA denying his petition for certiorari, thereby concealing the actual period for appeal from the Court processor.
As already noted, petitionerâs motion for reconsideration failed to suspend the running of the reglementary period since it was filed two days too late. Worse, the Registry Return Receipt
[45]
 of the CA Resolution denying petitionerâs motion for reconsideration shows that it was received by counsel for petitionerâs agent on September 20, 2000, and not March 28, 2001 as claimed by petitioner. In fact, by Resolution dated May 7, 2001,
[46]
 the CA had ordered the issuance of an Entry of Judgment in this case, which was later withdrawn by Resolution of October 23, 2001
[47]
 following receipt by it of the instant Petition on May 15, 2001.
It cannot be overemphasized that parties and their counsel are duty-bound to observe honesty and truthfulness in all their pleadings, motions and statements before the courts
. Canon 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility states, âA lawyer owes candor, fairness and good faith to the court;â while Rules 10.01 and 10.03 of the same provide:

 Under this Resolution, the filing of a motion for reconsideration interrupted the 60-day period for the filing of a petition for certiorari under Rule 65. If the motion was denied, the aggrieved party could file the petition within the remaining period, which would not be less than 5 days in any event. Section 4 of Rule 65, as amended by this Resolution read:
Sec. 4. 
Where petition filed.
 - The petition may be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution sought to be assailed in the Supreme Court or, if it relates to the acts or omissions of a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person, in the Regional Trial Court exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Supreme Court. It may also be filed in the Court of Appeals whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, or in the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its jurisdiction. If it involves the acts or omissions of a quasi-judicial agency, and unless otherwise provided by law or these Rules, the petition shall be filed in and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals.
If
 
the
 
petitioner
 
had
 
filed
 
a
 
motion
 
for
 
new
 
trial
 
or
 
reconsideration
 
in
 
due
 
time
 
after notice
 
of
 
said
 
judgment,
 
order
 
or
 
resolution,
 
the
 
period
 
herein
 
fixed
 
shall
 
be
 
interrupted. If
 
the
 
motion
 
is
 
denied,
 
the
 
aggrieved
 
party
 
may
 
file
 
the
 
petition
 
within
 
the
 
remaining period,
 
but
 
which
 
shall
 
be
 
not
 
less
 
than
 
five
 
(5)
 
days
 
in
 
any
 
event,
 
reckoned
 
from
 
notice of
 
such
 
denial.
 
No
 
extension
 
of
 
time
 
to
 
file
 
the
 
petition
 
shall
 
be
 
granted
 
except
 
for
 
the most
 
compelling
 
reason
 
and
 
in
 
no
 
case
 
to
 
exceed
 
fifteen
 
(15)
 
days
. (Underscoring supplied)
The foregoing was again amended by SC Admin. Memo. No. 00-2-3 dated Sept 1, 2000, which prescribes that the 60-day period shall be counted from the notice of the denial of a motion for reconsideration, should one have been filed. Thus, Section 4 of Rule 65 now reads:
Sec. 4. 
Where petition filed.
 - 
The
 
petition
 
shall
 
be
 
filed
 
not
 
later
 
than
 
sixty
 
(60)
 
days from
 
notice
 
of
 
the
 
judgment,
 
order
 
or
 
resolution.
 
In
 
case
 
a
 
motion
 
for
 
reconsideration
 
or new
 
trial
 
is
 
timely
 
filed,
 
whether
 
such
 
motion
 
is
 
required
 
or
 
not,
 
the
 
sixty
 
(60)
 
day
 
period shall
 
be
 
counted
 
from
 
notice
 
of
 
the
 
denial
 
of
 
said
 
motion
.
The petition shall be filed in the Supreme Court or, if it relates to the acts or omissions of a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person, in the Regional Trial Court exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Supreme Court. It may also be filed in the Court of Appeals whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, or in the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. If it involves the acts or omissions of a quasi-judicial agency, unless otherwise provided by the law or these Rules, the petition shall be filed in and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals.
No extension of time to file the petition shall be granted except for compelling reason and in no case exceeding fifteen (15) days. (Underscoring supplied)

 As explained in 
Lloren v. De Veyra
 (4 SCRA 637, 641 [1962]), the day on which the motion for reconsideration (which interrupts the period to appeal) is filed is not computed as part of the reglementary period; 
vide
: Refugia v. Court of Appeals,
 258 SCRA 347, 354-355 (1996); Rules of Court, Rule 22, sec. 2:
Sec. 2. 
Effect of interruption.
 â Should an act be done which effectively interrupts the running of the period, the allowable period after such interruption shall start to run on the day after notice of the cessation of the cause thereof.
The day of the act that caused the interruption shall be excluded in the computation of the period. (n)
[35]
 Curiously, while petitioner clearly states in his Petition, following the heading âAntecedent Facts,â that he received notice of the denial of his motion for reconsideration on December 29, 1999 (
Rollo
 at 10), he later claims in his âBrief Statement of Factsâ that said notice âwas only received by petitioner in person on January 31, 2000â (
Rollo
 at 13). Stranger still, in his Petition before the Court of Appeals, petitioner alleged that he received the same notice on January 29, 2000 (
Rollo
 at 78; CA 
Rollo
 at 3).
Unfortunately, the Registry Return Receipt of the notice of the RTCâs denial of petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration was not attached to the records forwarded to this Court. However, whether petitioner received the subject notice on December 29, 1999, January 29, 2000 or January 31, 2000, the ultimate result is still the same.
[36]
 Until Feburary 4, 2000, if he received the notice of the denial of his Motion for Reconsideration on January 29, 2000. Until February 6, 2000, if he received said notice on January 31, 2000.
