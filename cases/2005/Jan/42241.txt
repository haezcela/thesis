REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL CONCERN, FELIPE SUZARA AND RAMON GARCIA, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


In issue in the present Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision
[1]
 of November 29, 2002 which modified the trial courtâs decision is whether defendant appellant-respondent Felipe Suzara can be made solidarily liable, along with his co-respondents Institute for Social Concern (ISC) and its Executive Director Ramon Garcia.
On September 28, 1989, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, through the Office of the President (the Republic), and the ISC, represented by its Executive Director Ramon Garcia, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
[2]
 wherein ISC, for a consideration of P8,488,880.00, undertook to construct forty-five (45) one storey two-classroom school buildings in the Cordillera Autonomous Region, Region 2 and Region 5.
For its part, the Republic undertook, upon the signing and execution of the MOA, to deposit in trust in a non-interest earning account with ISC 70% of the contract price, with the balance of 30% to be remitted âafter submission of monthly delivery report indicating 50% completion as attested and certified by the [Republic].â
It was made clear in the MOA that ISC would 
deliver the 45 two-classroom school buildings within 90 days from the release of funds
 âas specified in this agreementâ and should it fail to comply therewith, the Republic may exact liquidated damages equivalent to one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) of the total amount for each day of delay.
The Republic complied with its undertaking by issuing a check dated October 6, 1989 in the amount of P5,942,160.00 in the name of ISC which the latter had encashed.
ISC, however, failed to comply with its obligation, it having been found that the construction of school buildings âlagged behind . . . time schedule.â
[3]
On July 5, 1990, the Republic issued another check in the name of ISC in the amount of P2,546,640.00 which check had been cleared.
Subsequently, or on September 12, 1990, the parties forged an amendment to the MOA
[4]
 by adding the following conditions:
That upon release of the 30% fund balance, the school buildings which are on-going must be 
completed
 
within
 
thirty
 
(30)
 
days
 
for
 
Cagayan
 
and
 
forty-five
 
(45)
 
days
 
for
 
Masbate
. 
Those
 
which
 
are
 
not
 
yet
 
started
 
must
 
be
 
completed
 
within
 
one
 
hundred
 
twenty
 
(120)
 
days
.
The specified 120 days shall be devoted to physical construction works/activities provided that the buildings shall strictly follow the standard design of the PSF school building program.  If the ORGANIZATION    fails to deliver the completed school buildings, the REPUBLIC may exact liquidated damages equivalent to one-tenth of one (0.1%) percent of the total    amount for each day of delay.

In the amendment to the MOA, ISC was represented by its Chairman Suzara.
The full payment to ISC of the contract price and the amendment to the MOA notwithstanding, ISC failed to honor its commitment under the MOA, as amended, drawing the Republic to file on December 8, 1993 a complaint for Damages before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila against ISC, its Chairman Suzara, and its Executive Director Garcia.
In its Complaint, the Republic alleged,
 inter alia
, that
3.2   Defendants are 
guilty
 
of
 
fraud
 in contracting their obligations 
for
 
they
 
had
 
no
 
intention
 
whatsoever
 
to
 
perform
 
them
 
and
 
had
 
falsely
 
represented
 
to
 
Presidential
 
Management
 
and
 
Staff
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
financially
 
capable
 
and
 
had
 
all
 
the
 
technical
 
expertise
 
and
 
experience
 to construct the school buildings when in truth and in fact, they were not, as shown by the fact that they could not even start the construction of some school buildings and could not complete the construction of some of them. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
ISC and Suzara jointly filed an Answer with Counterclaims but Garcia did not file any and was, on the Republicâs motion, declared in default.
On the allegation of fraud in the complaint, ISC and Suzara âspecifically den[ied] the averments contained in pars. 3.1 to 3.7 inclusive,â they alleging as SPECIAL AND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES the following:
x x x
9. That answering defendant 
Suzaraâs
 
participation
 
was
 
limited
 
to
 
his
 
official
 
capacity
 
as
 
Chairman
 
of
 
ISC
 and did not at any time made (sic) any representation or undertakings in his personal capacity;
10. That the participation of answering defendant ISC in the    completion and delivery of the subject school buildings, with the full knowledge and consent of plaintiff, was merely for purposes of supervision and monitoring;
11. That answering defendants complied with all its obligations and undertaking under the pertinent agreement entered into with the plaintiff;
12. That if there are any obligation due to plaintiff, the same are liabilities to be answered for and paid by the defaulting contractors of the project concerned as contracted by defendant ISC;
x x x (Underscoring supplied)
[6]
At the pre-trial, ISC and Suzara, as well as their counsel, failed to show up.  Hence, on motion of the Republic, they were declared as in default.
ISC and Suzara filed a motion to lift the order declaring them as in default, but the trial court denied the same.
The Republic was thus allowed to present evidence 
ex-parte
 by Branch 14 of the RTC of Manila to which the case was raffled, following which it rendered a decision
[7]
 in favor of the Republic and disposed as follows:
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff and 
against
 
the
 
defendants
 by ordering the latter to pay the former, 
jointly
 
and
 
solidarily
, the sum of P3,757,288.26 representing a return of the consideration of the Memorandum of Agreement with liquidated damages equivalent    to 0.1% from the filing of this suit until fully paid, and exemplary damages in the sum of P50,000.00.  (Underscoring supplied)
[8]
ISC and Suzara appealed the decision of the trial court to the Court of Appeals, raising the following errors:
FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR
THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT PROPERLY APPLYING THE BASIC PROCEDURAL RULE AND WELL ESTABLISHED LEGAL DOCTRINE, THAT THE PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, IN ESTABLISHING THE CAUSE OF ACTION ASSERTED IN ITS COMPLAINT, MUST RELY UPON THE STRENGTH OF ITS OWN EVIDENCE, RATHER THAN ON THE PERCEIVED WEAKNESS OR INSUFFICIENCIES IN THE DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTSâ DEFENSES.
SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR.
THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO APPRECIATE, FIND AND DECLARE THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT BENEFITTED FROM THE ALLEGED TRANSACTION.
THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR
THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT DECLARING THAT THE PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE FAILED TO ADDUCE PREPONDERANCE EVIDENCE, TO ESTABLISH THE CAUSE OF ACTION ASSERTED IN ITS COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS.
FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR
THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT SETTING ASIDE ITS ORDER DATED APRIL 17, 1995 (ANNEX A, PETITION) AND LIKEWISE ERRED IN NOT GRANTING THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION DATED MAY 2, 1995 FILED BY DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS.
FIFTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR
THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT STRICTLY INTERPRETED THE RULES ON DEFAULT ON DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS, RATHER THAN APPLYING ITS ACCEPTED LIBERAL CONSTRUCITON.
SIXTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT ADJUDGED THAT DEFENDANT-APPELLANT SUZARA WAS PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR THE OBLIGATIONS OF DEFENDANTâAPPELLANT ISC WHEN 
HE
 
MERELY
 
ACTED
 
IN
 
A
 
REPRESENTATIVE
 
CAPACITY
, THERE BEING 
NO
 
EVIDENCE
 
AVAILABLE
 
TO
 
SHOW
 
THAT
 
HE
 
ACTED
 
ON
 
HIS
 
PERSONAL
 
CAPACITY
.
SEVENTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR
THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN RENDERING JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE AND AGAINST DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF CONSIDERATION, LIQUIDATED AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
[9]
By its present challenged decision of November 29, 2002, the Court of Appeals found the assigned errors, 
except
 
No.
 
6,
 bereft of merit.
On assigned error No. 6, the appellate court held that indeed the trial court erred in holding Suzara jointly and severally liable with ISC, for Suzara acted in his personal capacity as Chairman of ISC which has a separate and distinct personality at the time of the execution of the MOA and its amendment.  Citing the case of 
Tramat Mercantile Inc. v. Court of Appeals
[10]
 wherein this Court cited instances when, without necessarily piercing the veil of corporate fiction, personal civil liability can also lawfully attach to a corporate director, trustee or officer, to wit:
Personal liability of a corporate director, trustee or officer along (although not necessarily) with the corporation may so validly attach, as a rule, only when â
He assents (a) to a patently unlawful act of the corporation, or (b) for bad faith or gross negligence in directing its affairs, or (c) for conflict of interest, resulting in damages to the corporation, its stockholders or other persons;
He consents to the issuance of watered stocks or who, having knowledge thereof, does not forthwith file with the corporate secretary his written objection thereto;
He agrees to hold himself personally and solidarily liable with the corporation; or
He is made, by a specific provision of law, to personally answer for his corporate action,
[11]
the Court of Appeals, noting that none of the above enumerated instances is present in the case to call for the imposition of personal civil liability of Suzara, modified the trial courtâs decision by sparing Suzara from liability.
Hence, the present petition of the Republic raising the following sole issue:
WHETHER OR NOT THE ASSAILED DECISION DATED NOVEMBER 29, 2002 OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IS CORRECT 
IN
 
NOT
 
APPLYING
 
THE
 
DOCTRINE
 
OF
 
PIERCING
 
THE
 
VEIL
 
OF
 
CORPORATE
 
ENTITY
 
AND
 
IN
 
NOT
 
ADJUDGING
 
RESPONDENTS
 
SUZARA
 
AND
 
GARCIA
 
JOINTLY
 
AND
 
SOLIDARILY
 
LIABLE
 WITH RESPONDENT ISC.  (Underscoring supplied)
[12]
The Republic argues that the dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals decision âspeaks in no uncertain terms that it is only respondent ISC that should be liable to the petitioner [and] by absolving even Ramon Garcia who did not appeal, it . . . committed grave abuse of discretion.â  The Republic goes on to argue as follows:
The evidence on record clearly shows that 
respondents
 
Suzara
 
and
 
Garcia
 
diverted
 
the
 
funds
 provided by petitioner to respondent ISC intended for the construction of the buildings.  There is a need to apply the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate entity in the instant case.  Respondents Suzara and Garcia used respondent ISC, a corporation, as a shield to justify their wrong deeds and in order to protect the fraud they committed.  
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
respondent
 
ISC,
 
a
 
non-stock,
 
non-profit
 
and
 
non-governmental
 
organization
 
organized
 
under
 
and
 
by
 
virtue
 
of
 
the
 
laws
 
of
 
the
 
Philippines
 
is
 
being
 
used
 
to
 
defeat
 
public
 
convenience
.  Respondent ISC was contracted by petitioner due to its being organized as a non-governmental organization.  This privilege was abused by respondents Suzara and Garcia.
It is not disputed that part of the amount given in consideration of the memorandum of agreement was invested in securities through Philippine Commercial Capital Inc.  This could not have happened without the knowledge and consent of respondents Suzara and Garcia.
[13]
Citing
 Robledo v. National Labor Relations Commission
[14]
 wherein this Court held:
The doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate entity is used whenever a court finds that the corporate fiction is being used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, or defend crime or to confuse legitimate issues, or that a corporation is the mere alter ego or business conduit of a person or where the corporation is so organized and controlled and its affairs are so conducted as to make it merely an instrumentality, agency, conduit or adjunct of another corporation.,
[15]
the Republic pleads that Suzara and Garcia must be made jointly and severally liable with ISC, â[t]he non application of the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate entity . . . not be[ing] allowed to in a way justify the wrong and protect the fraud committed by. . . Suzara and Garcia.â
The petition fails.
As quoted earlier, the Republic in its complaint charged ISC et al. to be guilty of fraud for âthey had no intention whatsoever to perform them and had falsely represented . . . that they were financially capable and had all the technical expertise and experience.â But as stated earlier, Suzara in the Answer he jointly filed with ISC denied the allegation of misrepresentation, he claiming that his participation in the execution of the MOA was limited to his official capacity as Chairman of ISC.
Issues having been joined after ISC and Suzara jointly filed their Answer, it was incumbent for the Republic to prove the issue,
 inter alia,
 of whether Suzaraâs participation in the MOA was limited to his official capacity as Chairman of ISC.
Albeit ISC and Suzara were declared as in default on December 12, 1994 under Rule 20 of the Revised Rules of Court,
[16]
 the Republic had the burden of proving that first, Suzara, contrary to his claim, participated in the MOA not only in his official capacity as Chairman but also in his personal capacity, and second, that he, along with ISC, committed fraud.  For fraud cannot be presumed and it must be established by clear and sufficient evidence.
[17]
 Courts never sustain findings of fraud upon circumstances which, at most, create only suspicion.
[18]
It does not mean, however, that fraud can only be proved by direct evidence.  For, it being a state of mind, it may be inferred from the circumstances of the case.
[19]
A scrutiny of the evidence presented 
ex-parte
 by the Republic shows that it is documentary.
Among the documents presented and offered in evidence were âSchedule I of Audit findings and recommendationâ (Exh. âH-3â) showing ISC Investments as of August 31, 1991,

the purpose of which document was âTo show the interests made by defendants of the amount received by them from plaintiff and the amount of P223,022.60 as interest earned from investmentsâ;
[21]
 and âFinancial analysis of investments made by defendants of the money received from plaintiffâ (Exh. âSâ)
[22]
 and âDocuments issued by Philippine Commercial Capital, Inc. showing investments of defendantsâ (Exhs. âS-1â â âS-25â),
[23]
 the purpose of which was âTo show that instead of using the funds received from plaintiff in the construction of the school buildings, defendants invested the same in certain financial institutions or Philippine Commercial Capital, Inc.â
In its decision, the trial court found that the ISC, Suzara and Garcia âdiverted the funds intended for the construction of the buildings by investing the same in certain financial institutions (Exhs. âS,â âS-1â to âS-24â) . . . naturally result[ing] in the non-completion of the school buildings and in some instances, although the buildings were completed, the same were defective . . .â
[24]
Both the Schedule I, ISC Investments â Exh. âH-3â and the âFinancial Analysisâ â Exh. âSâ as well as the documents â Exhs. âS-1â â âS-25â issued by Philippine Commercial Capital, Inc. indicate that placement of investments by ISC began on the last quarter of 1990.  It bears noting, in this connection, that the Republic paid ISC P5,942,160.00 on October 6,  
1989
.  And it paid P2,546,640.00 on 
July
 
5,
 
1990
.  There is no showing, however, that the same or part of the funds received from the Republic were those invested by ISC in financial institutions.
To infer from the above-specified documents, as what the Republic did in its brief before the appellate and this Court, that Suzara being then Chairman of ISC âclearly assented to a patently unlawful actâ by agreeing âto divert the funds intended for the construction of 45 school buildingsâ is a 
non sequitor
.  Parenthetically, the allegation of fraud involving Suzara in the complaint was one arising from misrepresentation of financial capability and technical expertise and experience to construct the school buildings, not from âdiversion.â
In fine, the participation, if any, by Suzara in the alleged diversion is not unexplainable.
[25]
 Unfortunately, he was declared as in default.  At all events, it is speculatory.  As such, fraud as the Republicâs basis in urging the piercing the veil of corporate fiction does not lie.
This Court would not also hold Suzara personally liable for, as correctly found by the appellate court which cited
 Tramat Mercantile, Inc. v. CA
[26]
 enumerating instances when personal liability of a corporate director, trustee or officer along (although not necessarily) with the corporation may, as a rule, attach, none of those or of analogous instances is present in Suzaraâs case.
As for the Republicâs lament in the appellate courtâs ânot adjudging . . . Garcia jointly and solidarily liable with . . . ISC,â its attention is invited to 
Tropical Homes, Inc. v. Fortun et al.
[27]
 wherein this Court held:
We have always recognized the general rule that in appellate proceedings, the reversal of the judgment on appeal is binding only on the parties in the appealed case and does not affect or inure to the benefit of those who did not join or were not made parties to the appeal.  An exception to the rule exists, however, where a judgment cannot be reversed as to the party appealing without affecting the rights of his co-debtor, or where the rights and liabilities of the parties appealing are so interwoven and dependent on each other as to be inseparable, in which case a reversal as to one operates as a reversal as to all.  This exception which is based on a communality of interest of said parties is recognized in this jurisdiction.
