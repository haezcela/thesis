THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. NO. 163604, May 06, 2005 ]


REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS (TWENTIETH DIVISION), HON. PRESIDING JUDGE FORTUNITO L. MADRONA, RTC-BR. 35 AND APOLINARIA MALINAO JOMOC, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO-MORALES, J


In "In the Matter of Declaration of Presumptive Death of Absentee Spouse Clemente P. Jomoc, Apolinaria Malinao Jomoc, petitioner," the Ormoc City, Regional Trial Court, Branch 35, by 
Order
 
of
 
September
 
29
, 
1999
,
[1]
 granted the petition on the basis of the Commissioner's Report
[2]
 and accordingly declared the absentee spouse, who had left his petitioner-wife nine years earlier, presumptively dead.
In granting the petition, the trial judge, Judge Fortunito L. Madrona, cited Article 41, par. 2 of the Family Code.  Said article provides that 
for
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
contracting
 
a
 
valid
 
subsequent
 
marriage
 during the subsistence of a previous marriage where the prior spouse had been absent for four consecutive years, the spouse present must institute 
summary
 
proceedings
 for the 
declaration
 
of
 
presumptive
 
death
 
of
 
the
 
absentee spouse
, without prejudice to the effect of the reappearance of the absent spouse.
The Republic, through the Office of the Solicitor General, sought to appeal the trial court's order by filing a Notice of Appeal.
[3]
By 
Order
 
of
 
November
 
22,
 
1999s
,
[4]
 the trial court, noting that no record of appeal was filed and served "as required by and pursuant to Sec. 2(a), Rule 41 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the present case being a special proceeding," disapproved the Notice of Appeal.
The Republic's Motion for Reconsideration of the trial court's order of disapproval having been denied by 
Order
 
of
 
January
 
13,
 
2000
,
[5]
 it filed a Petition for Certiorari
[6]
 before the Court of Appeals, it contending that the declaration of presumptive death of a person under Article 41 of the Family Code is not a special proceeding or a case of multiple or separate appeals requiring a record on appeal.
By Decision of May 5, 2004,
[7]
 the Court of Appeals denied the Republic's petition on procedural and substantive grounds in this wise:
At the outset, it must be stressed that the petition is not sufficient in form.  It 
failed
 
to
 
attach
 
to
 
its
 
petition
 
a
 
certified
 
true
 
copy
 
of the
 
assailed
 
Order
 
dated
 
January
 
13,
 
2000
 [denying its Motion for Reconsideration of the November 22, 1999 Order disapproving its Notice of Appeal]. Moreover, the petition questioned the [trial court's] 
Order
 
dated
 
August
 
15,
 
1999
, which declared Clemente Jomoc presumptively dead, likewise for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, yet, not even a copy could be found in the records.  On this score alone, the petition should have been dismissed outright in accordance with Sec. 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court.
However, despite the procedural lapses, the Court resolves to delve deeper into the substantive issue of the validity/nullity of the assailed    order.
The
 
principal
 
issue
 
in
 
this
 
case
 
is
 
whether
 
a
 
petition
 
for
 
declaration of
 
the
 
presumptive
 
death
 
of
 
a
 
person
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
a
 
special
 
 proceeding.
  If it is, the period to appeal is 30 days and the party appealing must, in addition to a notice of appeal, file with the trial court a record on appeal to perfect its appeal.  Otherwise, if the petition is an ordinary action, the period to appeal is 15 days from notice or decision or final order appealed from and the appeal is perfected by filing a notice of appeal (Section 3, Rule 41, Rules of Court).
As defined in Section 3(a), Rule 1 of the Rules of Court, "a civil    action is one by which a party sues another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the prevention of redress of a wrong" while 
a
 
special
 
proceeding
 
under
 
Section
 
3(c)
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
rule
 
is
 
defined
 
as
 
"a
 
remedy
 
by
 
which
 
a
 
party
 
seeks
 
to
 
establish
 
a
 
status,
 
a
 
right
 
or
 
a
 
particular
 
fact
 (Heirs of Yaptinchay, et al. v. Del Rosario, et al., G.R. No. 124320, March 2, 1999).
Considering the aforementioned distinction, this Court finds that 
the
 
instant
 
petition
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
a
 
special
 
proceeding
 
and
 
not
 
an
 
ordinary
 
action.
  The petition merely seeks for a declaration by the trial court    of the presumptive death of absentee spouse Clemente Jomoc.  It does not seek    the enforcement or protection of a right or the prevention or redress of a wrong.  Neither does it involve a demand of right or a cause of action that can be enforced against any person.
On the basis of the foregoing discussion, the subject Order dated January 13, 2000 denying OSG's Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dated November 22, 1999 disapproving its Notice of Appeal was correctly issued.  
The
 
instant
 
petition,
 
being
 
in
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
a
 
special
 
proceeding,
 
OSG
 
should
 
have
 
filed,
 
in
 
addition
 
to
 
its
 
Notice
 
of
 
Appeal,
 
a
 record on appeal in accordance with Section 19 of the Interim Rules and Guidelines to Implement BP Blg. 129 and Section 2(a), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court . . . (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
The Republic (petitioner) insists that the declaration of presumptive death under Article 41 of the Family Code is not a special proceeding involving multiple or separate appeals where a record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner.
Petitioner cites Rule 109 of the Revised Rules of Court which enumerates the cases wherein multiple appeals are allowed and a record on appeal is required for an appeal to be perfected.  The petition for the declaration of presumptive death of an absent spouse not being included in the enumeration, petitioner contends that a mere notice of appeal suffices.
By Resolution of December 15, 2004,
[8]
 this Court, noting that copy of the September 27, 2004 Resolution
[9]
 requiring respondent to file her comment on the petition was returned unserved with postmaster's notation "Party refused," Resolved to consider that copy deemed served upon her.
The pertinent provisions on the 
General Provisions
 on 
Special Proceedings
, Part II of the Revised Rules of Court entitled SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS, read:
RULE 72
SUBJECT MATTER AND APPLICABILITY
OF GENERAL RULES
Section 1.

matter
 
of
 
special

 â Rules of special proceedings are provided for in the following:

The pertinent provision of the Civil Code on presumption of death provides:
Art. 390.  After an absence of seven years, it being unknown whether or not the absentee still lives, he shall be 
presumed
 
dead
 
for
 
all
 
purposes,
 
except
 
for
 
those
 
of
 
succession
.
x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Upon the other hand, Article 41 of the Family Code, upon which the trial court anchored its grant of the petition for the declaration of presumptive death of the absent spouse, provides:
Art. 41.  A marriage contracted by any person during the subsistence of a previous marriage shall be null and void, unless before the celebration of the subsequent marriage, the prior spouses had been absent for four consecutive years and the spouse present had a well-founded belief that the absent spouses was already dead.  In case of disappearance where there is danger of death under the circumstances set forth in the provisions of Article 391 of the Civil Code, an absence of only two years shall be sufficient.
For
 
the
 
purpose
 
pf
 
contracting
 
the
 
subsequent
 
marriage
 
under
 
the
 
preceding
 
paragraph, the
 
spouses
 
present
 
must
 
institute
 
a
 
summary
 
proceeding
 
as
 
provided
 
in
 
this
 
Code
 
for
 
the
 
declaration
 
of
 
presumptive
 
death
 
of
 
the
 
absentee
, without prejudice to the effect of a reappearance of the absent spouse.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Rule 41, Section 2 of the Revised Rules of Court, on Modes of Appeal, invoked by the trial court in disapproving petitioner's Notice of Appeal, provides:
Sec. 2.  
Modes of appeal. 
 -
(a) 
Ordinary appeal. 
- The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party.  
No
 
record
 
on
 
appeal
 
shall
 
be
 
required
 
except
 
in
 
special
 
proceedings
 
and
 
other
 
cases
 
of
 
multiple
 
or
 
separate
 
 appeals
 
where
 
the
 
law
 
or
 
these
 
Rules
 
so
 
require
.  In such cases, the record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
x x x
By the trial court's citation of Article 41 of the Family Code, it is gathered that the petition of Apolinaria Jomoc to have her absent spouse declared presumptively dead 
had
 
for
 
its
 
purpose
 
her
 
desire
 
to
 
contract
 
a
 
valid
 
subsequent
 
marriage
.  
Ergo
, the petition for that purpose is a "
summary proceeding
," following above-quoted Art. 41, paragraph 2 of the Family Code.
Since Title XI of the Family Code, entitled SUMMARY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING IN THE FAMILY LAW, contains the following provision,
 inter alia
:
x x x
Art. 238.  Unless modified by the Supreme Court, the procedural rules in this Title shall apply 
in
 
all
 
cases
 
provided
 
for
 
in
 
this
 
Codes
 
requiring
 
summary
 
court
 
proceedings
.  
Such cases shall be decided in an expeditious manner without regard to technical rules.
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
x x x,
there is no doubt that the petition of Apolinaria Jomoc required, and is, therefore, a summary proceeding under the Family Code, not a special proceeding under the Revised Rules of Court appeal for which calls for the filing of a Record on Appeal.  It being a summary ordinary proceeding, the filing of a Notice of Appeal from the trial court's order sufficed.
That the Family Code provision on repeal, Art. 254, provides as follows:
Art. 254.  Titles III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XI and XV of Book I of Republic Act No. 386, otherwise known as the Civil Code of the Philippines, as amended, and Articles 17, 18, 19, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 39, 40, 41 and 42 of Presidential Decree No. 603, otherwise known as the Child and Youth Welfare Code, as amended, and 
all
 
laws,
 
decrees,
 
executive
 
orders,
 
proclamations
 
rules
 
and
 
regulations,
 
or
 
parts
 
thereof,
 
inconsistent
 
therewith
 
are
 
hereby
 
repealed,
  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),
seals the case in petitioner's favor.
Finally, on the alleged procedural flaw in petitioner's petition before the appellate court.  Petitioner's failure to attach to his petition before the appellate court a copy of the trial court's 
order
 
denying
 
its
 
motion
 
for
 
reconsideration
 of the disapproval of its Notice of Appeal is not necessarily fatal, for the rules of procedure are not to be applied in a technical sense.  Given the issue raised before it by petitioner, what the appellate court should have done was to direct petitioner to comply with the rule.
As for petitioner's failure to submit copy of the trial court's order granting the petition for declaration of presumptive death, contrary to the appellate court's observation that petitioner was also assailing it, petitioner's 8-page petition
[10]
 filed in said court does not so reflect, it merely having assailed the 
order
 
disapproving
 
the
 
Notice
 
of
 
Appeal
.
WHEREFORE,
 the assailed May 5, 2004 Decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby
 REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
.  Let the case be 
REMANDED
 to it for appropriate action in light of the foregoing discussion.
SO ORDERED.
Panganiban, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona,
