MELENCIO P. MANANSALA III, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE FATIMA G. ASDALA, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT (RTC), BR. 87, QUEZON CITY, RESPONDENT. 
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO-MORALES, J.:


The following incidents spawned the filing of the present administrative case.
Before noon of February 1, 2003, Winfried Herbst, a German national, was detained at Police Station 10 in Kamuning, Quezon City for breaking a glass wall in the office of Melencio P. Manansala III (complainant) at PM Building at 24 Matalino St., Diliman, Quezon City.  By complainant's account, in late afternoon of even date, Judge Fatima G. Asdala (respondent) of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 87, called up by telephone the Station Commander of Station 10 Police Superintendent Atty. Joel Napoleon Coronel, requesting for the release of Herbst to her custody. Atty. Coronel, however, did not accede to respondent's request, he informing her that complainant was adamant in filing criminal charges against Herbst and they were just waiting for the arrival of the inquest fiscal.
Complainant further relates that on February 3, 2003, Mark Cabigao, the sheriff assigned at respondent's sala, together with two policemen, went to PM Building and requested that the Mercedes Benz car of Herbst which he parked within the vicinity be turned over to their custody.
On February 4, 2003, complainant, together with retired Quezon City Regional Trial Court Judge Marcelino Bautista appeared at the "Direct Connect," a television show of Atty. Batas Mauricio, wherein complainant aired respondent's alleged meddling in the case against Herbst.  In the same show, respondent's side was, through telephone, likewise aired.
The following day or on February 5, 2003, respondent filed before the Quezon City Prosecutor's Office a complaint for libel against complainant and Judge Bautista for allegedly defaming her in the television show of Atty. Mauricio.
Subsequently, on February 13, 2003, complainant filed a complaint-affidavit, with a supplemental complaint-affidavit, against respondent before the Office of the Ombudsman charging her with violation of Section 3(a) of Republic Act 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) for allegedly
Persuading, inducing or influencing another public officer to perform an act constituting a violation of rules and regulations duly promulgated by competent authority or an offense in connection with the official duties of the latter or allowing himself to be persuaded, induced, or influenced to commit such violation or offense.
By Memorandum
[1]
 of February 17, 2003, the Ombudsman considered the case against respondent closed and terminated without prejudice and referred it to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) for appropriate action.
Upon receipt by the OCA of complainant's complaint-affidavit and supplemental complaint-affidavit on March 13, 2003, it directed respondent, by Indorsement
[2]
 dated April 9, 2003, to submit her comment thereon.
In her comment
[3]
 dated May 16, 2003, respondent claimed that the complaint at bar was intended to harass her â for the purpose of getting back at her, she having charged complainant and his lawyer Marcelino Bautista, Jr. with libel.  Respondent's version of what transpired on February 1 and 3, 2003 is quoted 
verbatim
:
On February 1, 2003, a Saturday, at about 6:30 in the evening, as I was on my way out to treat my children to a weekend dinner, I received an overseas call from Ed Berzosa, a first cousin working [in] Hilton Macau asking for advi[c]e in regard [to] his benefactor, who before noon of that day, was    allegedly taken to the Kamuning Police Station for some offense.  Since Ed could not accurately provide me the information I desired to know to be able to give the proper legal advice, I instructed Ed instead to get in touch with his benefactor Winfried Herbst and advise the latter to call me.  At about 7 o'clock, my phone rang.  
It
 
was
 
Herbst
 
on
 
the
 
line,
 
saying
 
that
 
he
 
was
 
arrested
 
upon
 
the
 
complaint
 
of
 
Manansala
 
after
 
he
 
broke
 
some
 
glass
 
in
 
the
 
latter's
 
office
 
on
 
provocation;
 
that
 
he
 
did
 
so
 
because
 
he
 
was
 
fed
 
up
 
with
 
Manansala's
 
refusal
 
and
 
delay
 
in
 
paying
 
what
 
he
 
(Manansala)
 owes him, that he was detained at the Kamuning Police Station at about 11:00 in the morning and that his complainant, who seems to be very popular with the police officers thereat, would call every now and then, oftentimes, leaving threatening words,    through his cohorts at the station, for Herbst.
I could sense Herbst's agitation mainly due to the fact that he claims he has not been unable to reach his lawyer since he was detained, neither was his side of the incident taken down by the police.
When Herbst asked if he could already be released, that was the time I decided to give the needed advice and information, such as: that if there has been a formal complaint, for sure, he will be brought to inquest, and that since it is Saturday, an inquest prosecutor is on duty and so, I then asked Herbst to find out from the investigator when inquest will take place.  As Herbst had a sideline conversation with someone, 
I
 
heard
 
someone
 
in
 
the
 
background
 
ask
 
Herbst
 
who
 
he
 
was
 
in
 
conversation
 
with.
 
Before
 
I
 
knew
 
it,
 
someone
 
other
 
tha[n]
 
Herbst
 
was
 
on
 
the
 
line
 
and
 
he
 
introduced
 
himself
 
as
 
some
 
police
 
officer
 
whose
 
name
 
I
 
cannot
 
recall
 and asked what is it I wanted to know and who I am.  I 
introduced
 
myself
 
as
 
Mrs.
 
Asdala,
 
a
 
friend
 
of
 
Herbst
 and inquired if there has been a complaint filed against Herbst, for what crime and when the case will be inquested.  I gathered then that Herbst was charged with malicious mischief for a damaged glass wall costing more or less P30,000.00, that inquest will take place at about 9 o'clock in the evening.
Having been so informed, I asked to speak with Herbst again whence I advised Herbst that in an inquest investigation, whatever he will say will be immaterial, as the inquest fiscal will focus only on what the complaint says;  he has to wait for the resolution of the fiscal whose recommendation will be for further investigation, if he finds the complaint and evidence insufficient, in which case he will have the opportunity to submit his counter-affidavit or the fiscal may recommend filing of the case.  Either way, the recommendation will wait for the approval of the Chief City Prosecutor or his assistant before he can be released without necessity of bail if for further investigation; with bail, if filed. Often the inquest fiscal's recommendation stays for minor offenses like malicious mischief, UNLESS, some interested souls INTERVENE for a reversal.  I also advised Herbst of what demeanor to take during the inquest to avoid getting the ire of the inquest investigator, then hanged up but advising to keep me posted by text of the development, 
but
 
suggested
 
to
 
offer
 
[to]
 
pay
 
the
 
damage
 
caused
 
at
 
once,
 
to
 
soothe
 
his
 
complainant
.
At about 10 o'clock in the evening, Herbst sent [a] message that    the inquest prosecutor's recommendation is for further investigation.  I texted back saying that it is good news as he then will have the opportunity to present his side before a final resolution is made.

On February 3, 200
[3]
, at about 4:30 in the afternoon, I had an incidental conversation with Atty. Bautista on the cell phone and asked why he would not want Herbst's Mercedes Benz removed from where it was parked along Malakas Street.  As related to me by Herbst, he left his Mercedes Benz unattended on the road fronting PM apartments where Manansala's office is located when he was forcibly hauled by the police summoned by Manansala in the morning of February 1, 2003.   
Herbst
 
called
 
to
 
inform
 
that
 
a
 
friend
 
reported
 
seeing
 
the
 
tires
 
of
 
his
 
car
 
all
 
flat
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
security
 
guards
 
of
 
Manansala's
 
office
 
were
 
responsible
 
for
 
that.
 
Fearing
 
more
 
vandalism,
 
he
 
asked
 
for
 
help
 
to
 
move
 
out
 
his
 
car
.
Working hours over, 
I
 
asked
 
my
 
sheriff
 
to
 
check
 
if
 
he
 
can
 
do
 
 anything.
 
My
 
sheriff
 
was
 
all
 
too
 
willing
 
to
 
help
 
that
 
he
 
immediately
 
proceeded
 
to
 
where
 
the
 
car
 
could
 
be
 
found
 
only
 
to
 
be
 
met
 
by
 
an
 
irate
 
Manansala
 
and
 
his
 
bosom
 
lawyer
 
Marcelino
 
Bautista,
 who berated him in front of several people and called him "pakialamero" at the same time telling him that no one can get Herbst car but Herbst personally . . .  which was precisely what Herbst was avoiding because Manansala's men almost roughed him up before the police came on February 1, 2003, when the incident leading to the filing of the case, occurred.  It appears that upon seeing my sheriff in office uniform, Atty. Bautista asked what court he is assigned.  
My
 
sheriff
 
then
 
called
 
up
 
to
 
inform
 
what
 
transpired
 
and
 
that
 
was when
 
I
 
asked
 
to
 
speak
 
with
 
Mr.
 
Bautista
 
ONLY
 
for
 
the
 
purpose
 
of
 
asking him
 
as
 
to
 
why
 
he
 
would
 
not
 
allow
 
the
 
car
 
to
 
be
 
pulled
 
out,
 after all, it has nothing to do with the case filed against Herbst by Manansala.  As earlier said, my only purpose in talking with Atty. Bautista on the phone was to ask for his reason in not allowing Herbst car moved out, knowing that the car was not even entrusted to him or to Manansala, thus, they do not have any right to withhold it from anyone in Herbst behalf.  
It
 
was
 
never
 
to
 
ask
 
for
 
the
 
release
 
of
 
the
 
car
, precisely for the reasons already stated, and which I emphasized in my conversation with Atty. Bautista that afternoon of February 3, 2003 
when,
 
Manansala
 
arrogantly
 
asked
 
why
 
the
 
effort
 
on
 
my
 
part.
 
I
 
told
 
him
 
Herbst
 
is
 
a
 
family
 
friend
, my cousin's benefactor and he asked for help with his car.  However, when Bautista, construed the effort as meddling, I thought any further conversation with him on the phone would not help especially when he made it clear that they will not allow anyone to get the car from where it was, so I told myself just to forget about it.  When Herbst texted that he has been released from detention after posting bail, I instead, advised him to get his car personally but reminding him to avoid any untoward confrontation with Manansala or his men or Bautista.

 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
By Resolution
[5]
 dated February 16, 2004, this Court referred the complaint to Court of Appeals Justice Renato C. Dacudao for investigation, report and recommendation.
In the investigation conducted by Justice Dacudao, complainant presented three witnesses, namely, Atty. Coronel, Sheriff Mark Cabigao, and Judge Bautista, the gists of whose testimonies follow after their names.
ATTY. CORONEL
 testified as follows:
On February 1, 2003, the duty desk officer, Police Chief Inspector Danilo Maceren, received a telephone call informing him that one who introduced herself as Judge Asdala wanted to talk to him (Atty. Coronel) by phone.  He thus talked to the caller who requested him to, if possible, release Herbst from detention and turn him to her custody, and asked about the possibility of the case being settled between complainant and Herbst.
[6]
Wanting to accommodate respondent's request, he summoned complainant to his office and echoed to him respondent's request.
[7]
Sheriff 
MARCELINO CABIGAO
 testified as follows:
On February 3, 2003, after office hours, "
napagutusan
 
lang
 
po
 
ako
 na pumunta sa
 Station 10 and 
ask
 
for
 
police
 
assistance
 and 
go
 
to
 
PM
 
Apartments
 
to
 
remove
 
a
 
vehicle
 
because it might be damaged or lost."
[8]
Upon arrival at the site where the vehicle was parked, he found out that all its 4 tires were already deflated.  And when he asked complainant and Judge Bautista for permission to get the vehicle, they refused, prompting him to call respondent and inform her that "they don't want to give it and even if they did, I cannot take it because it has already 4 flat tires."  Respondent then asked him who prevented him from retrieving the vehicle, upon which he named Judge Bautista and complainant.  Respondent further asked him to give his phone to Judge Bautista which he did, and after respondent talked to Judge Bautista, she told him (Cabigao) to leave the place if they do not want to release the vehicle.
[9]
JUDGE BAUTISTA
 declared that during his phone conversation with respondent in the afternoon of February 3, 2003, he told her to get an authorization from Herbst in order to retrieve the car as well as make an inventory of the contents of the vehicle to avoid any misunderstanding later.
[10]
Upon the other hand, 
RESPONDENT
, at the witness stand, repeated her claim that the administrative complaint was filed on account of her filing of the libel charges against complainant and Judge Bautista.
[11]
 And she reiterated the contents of her comment to the complaint, she reasserting that there was no interference on her part with regard to the investigation of Herbst took place.
[12]
INVESTIGATING JUSTICE DACUDAO
, by his Report and Recommendation,
[13]
 found respondent answerable for 
palpable
 
abuse
 
of
 
authority
 
or
 
plain
 
misconduct
. The pertinent portion of his report reads:
x x x [T]his Investigator believes that respondent judge could be held liable under Section 3(a) of Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, to wit:
x x x
Respondent judge can be faulted for having 
called
 
up
 
that
 
early
 
evening
 
of
 
February
 
1,
 
2003,
 
Atty.
 
Joel
 
Napoleon
 
Coronel
, station commander of the Kamuning Police Station No. 10, to 
request
 
for
 
the
 
release
 
to
 
her
 
custody
 
of
 
the
 
German
 
national
 
Winfried
 
Herbst,
 who was scheduled to undergo inquest investigation at the Office of the City Prosecutor of Quezon City, for malicious mischief (or vandalism), which the latter apparently committed, after he had allegedly smashed the window glass at the PM Building at 24 Matalino Street, Diliman, Quezon City, where the complainant Melencio P. Manansala III was living or holding office; as well as in 
asking
 
for
 
the
 
compounding
 
or
 
amicable
 
settlement
 
of
 
the
 
malicious
 
mischief
 (or vandalism) case against the German national.  For, it can hardly be doubted that in making both requests respondent judge, one way or another, wittingly or unwittingly, subtly or blatantly, brought to bear, or 
sought
 
to
 
bring
 
to
 
bear,
 
upon
 
the
 
precinct
 
commander,
 
the
 
influence
 
of
 
her
 
office
 
as
 
a
 
judge,
 
in
 
an
 
irregular
 
and
 
improper
 
manner.
  Rightly or wrongly, the public identifies the abstract precept of justice, and the administration of justice, with the persona and actuations of the visible human judge that they see, and with whom they come in contact, or deal with.  Respondent judge's plea of good faith thus becomes tenous when it is remembered that as a former fiscal or prosecutor, respondent judge ought to know that there is 
no
 
legal
 
or
 
statutory
 
warrant
 
or
 
basis,
 
at
 
that
 
time,
 
for
 
her
 
requests/
 
actions
 
in
 
seeking
 
to
 
obtain
 
(temporary)
 
custody
 
of
 
the
 
still-[to]
 
be-inquested
 
Winfried
 
Herbst,
 
or
 
for
 
the
 
compounding
 
or
 
amicable
 
settlement
 
of
 
the
 
malicious
 
mischief
 
(or vandalism)
 
case
, against the latter. However one looks at it, 
either
 
course
 
of
 
action
 
amounted
 
to
 
an
 
unjustified,
 
if
 
not
 
unlawful,
 
interference
 
or
 
meddling,
 ("or persuading, inducing or influencing another public officer" to borrow the language of the statute) 
with
 
the
 
work
 
of
 
the
 
police
 
precinct
 
commander
 
at
 
the
 
time
.
Thus conceding, for argument['s] sake, that a finding of liability under Section 3(a) of the Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, would be improper, since a finding that respondent had violated this Section 3(a) requires proof beyond reasonable doubt, for the reason that R.A. No. 3019, as amended, is a penal statute, still under the facts recited, 
respondent
 
judge
 
can
 
still
 
be
 
held
 
liable,
 
at
 
the
 
very
 
least,
 
for
 
palpable
 
abuse
 
of
 
authority
 
or
 
plain
 
misconduct,
 a finding whereon can rest upon substantial evidence, as was submitted in this case.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
Justice Dacudao thus found respondent judge liable "at the very least, for 
palpable abuse or plain misconduct
," and 
recommended
 
that
 
respondent
 
judge
 
be
 
fined
 
in
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
Ten
 
Thousand
 
Pesos
 
(P10,000.00)
, 
and
 
warned
 
that
 
a
 
repetition
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
or
 
similar
 
offense
 
will
 
merit
 
a
 
harsher
 
penalty
.
By Memorandum
[14]
 of February 28, 2005, the OCA made a contrary finding and recommended the dismissal of the complaint against respondent, to wit:
After a careful study of the records of the case, we have to withhold our concurrence with the findings of Justice Dacudao. The report of the investigating justice solely relies on the testimony of Atty. Joel Napoleon Coronel, the police superintendent and station commander whom Judge Asdala allegedly called and tried to persuade to release and place the detained Mr. Herbst under her custody. It must be pointed out that 
not
 
only
 
does
 
Judge
 
Asdala
 
categorically
 
deny
 
having
 
spoken
 
to
 
Atty.
 
Coronel,
 
but
 
the
 
latter
 
himself
 
acknowledges
 
that
 
he
 
did
 
not
 
know
 
the
 
respondent
 
judge
 and admits "that the person I was talking over the phone may or may not be Judge Asdala.["]  There is therefore 
the
 
shadow
 
of
 
doubt
 
created
 
by
 
the
 
possibility
 
that
 somebody 
else
 
could
 
have
 
used
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
Judge
 
Asdala
.
The
 
testimonial
 
evidence
 
presented
 
did
 
not
 
remove
 
the
 
probability
 
that
 
Judge
 
Asdala
 
 might
 
not
 
be
 
guilty
 
of
 
the
 
offense
 
charged,
 
thus
 
failing
 
to
 
establish
 
a
 
prima
 
facie
 
case
 
against
 
the
 
respondent
 
judge
.
The complainant's allegation that Judge Asdala continues to intimidate and use her authority to influence the outcome of the case was never substantiated by evidence, documentary or testimonial.
However, we find that 
sending
 
Sheriff
 
Cabigao
 
to
 
retrieve
 
the
 
car
 
of
 
Mr.
 
Herbst
 
was
 
improper
 despite the non-involvement of the car in the criminal case.  Even if it was already after office hours, the fact 
that
 
Sheriff
 
Cabigao,
 
being
 
a
 
personnel
 
of
 
Judge
 
Asdala's
 
own
 
court
 
still
 
in
 
his
 
office
 
uniform
 
and
 
accompanied
 
by
 
two
 
policemen,
 
would
 
send
 
the
 
wrong
 
signal,
 
as
 
it
 
did
.
Judges are expected to keep a watchful eye on the conduct of their employees, and not to ask them to perform tasks outside their official functions.  They are constrained to 
instill
 
in
 
the
 
court
 
personnel
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
propriety
 
and
 
probity
 
in
 
the
 
performance
 
of
 
judicial
 
functions.
 
Given
 
these requirements,
 
the
 
respondent
 
judge
 
should
 
be
 
aware
 
that
 
the
 
slightest
 
semblance
 
of
 
impropriety
 
on
 
the
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
employees
 
of
 
the
 
court
 
stirs
 
ripples
 
of
 
public
 
suspicion
 
and
 
public
 
distrust
 
of
 
the
 
judicial
 
administrators.
 
The
 
slightest
 
breach
 
of
 
duty
 
and
 
the
 
slightest
 
irregularity
 
in
 
the
 
conduct
 
of
 
court
 
officers
 
and
 
employees
 
detract
 
from
 
the
 
dignity
 
of
 
the courts
 
and
 
erode
 
the
 
faith
 
of
 
the
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
judiciary.
While we deem the respondent judge not guilty of violation of Sec 3(a) of R.A. 3019, palpable abuse of authority or plain misconduct, we are of the view that 
the
 
acts
 
properly
 
imputable
 
to
 
her,
 
while
 
not
 
warranting
 
the
 
imposition
 
of
 
any
 
disciplinary
 
sanction,
 
clearly
 
demonstrate
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
greater
 
care,
 
prudence
 
and
 
discretion
 
in
 
her
 
future
 
actions.
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, we respectfully submit for the consideration of the Honorable Court the following 
recommendations
:
That the administrative complaint against Judge Fatima G. Asdala of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 87), Quezon City, be 
DISMISSED
 
for
 
lack
 of merit;
That such dismissal notwithstanding, Judge Asdala should be 
ADMONISHED
 
to
avoid
 
acts
 that are inimical to the service and which would cloud the credibility of the court; and
That she be 
STERNLY
 
WARNED
 that a similar act in the future shall be strictly dealt with.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

Above-quoted Rule 2.04 is reproduced as CANON 2, Sec. 3 in the NEW CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT FOR THE PHILIPPINE JUDICIARY which took effect on June 1, 2004.
In administrative cases, the quantum of proof necessary to hold a respondent liable for the charge is substantial evidence or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion.
[15]
In the case at bar, respondent denies having talked to Atty. Coronel.  She admits though that she talked to one Maceren who, by her claim, butted in during her phone conversation with Herbst.  She proffers, however, that when she conversed with Maceren, she identified herself as Mrs. Asdala and merely asked him if a complaint had been filed against Herbst, for what offense, and when the case would be inquested.
Respondent's plain denial of the charge of influencing does not suffice to discredit the straightforward claim of Atty. Coronel, however.
MR. MANANSALA:
Did you inform me of, for lack of a better term at this point in time, inquiries from a certain judge regarding the Winfried Herbst complaint?
ATTY. CORONEL:
       I called you to my office because 
I
 
received
 
a
 
phone
 
call
 
from
 
a
 
person
 
 who
 
introduced
 
herself
 
as
 
Judge
 
Asdala
 
of
 
the
 
Regional
 
Trial
 
Court
 
of
 
Quezon
 
City
 
concerning
 
the
 
investigation
 
of
 
a
 
criminal
 
complaint
 
being
 
conducted
 
by
 
our
 
office
 
against
 
Mr.
 
Herbst.
x x x
JUDGE ASDALA:
What
 
particular
 
words
 
that
 
the
 
person
 
you
 
were
 
talking
 
with
 
on
 
[the]
 
phone
 
tell
 
you
 
that
 
is
 
now
 
being
 
considered
 
by
 
Mr.
 
Manansala
 
as
 
"pakikialam"?
ATTY. CORONEL:
The person who introduced herself as Judge Asdala asked me if I can possibly help a certain Mr. Herbst who was brought in to our station for investigation and 
that
 
he
 
would
 
not
 
be
 
detained
 and be 
released
 
to
 
the
 
custody
 
of
 
the
 
person
 
who
 
introduced
 
herself
 
as
 
Judge
 
Asdala.
x x x
JUDGE ASDALA:
Is it not that you entertained Mr. Manansala in your office because he is an English-speaking guy and he was decently dressed or what?
ATTY. CORONEL:
I asked Mr. Manansala to my office because 
I
 
received
 
a
 
call
 
from
 
a
 
person
 
who
 
introduced
 
herself
 
as
 
Judge
 
Asdala
 
and
 
that
 
is
 
the
 
reason
 
why
 
I
 
asked
 
Mr.
 
Manansala
 
to
 
my
 
office
 
and
 
asked
 
him
 
if
 
he
 
is
 
willing
 
to
 
settle
 
the
 
case
 
amicably
 
with
 
Mr.
 
Herbst
.
JUDGE ASDALA:
When you called Mr. Manansala in your office, you informed him that a certain Judge Ma. Fatima Asdala called in order to ask for a favor, is that it?
ATTY. CORONEL:
I informed him that Judge Asdala called me and ask me to help the person under investigation, Mr. Herbst, if possible to have the person released from detention and I told Mr. Manansala 
the
 
only
 
way
 
that
 
I
 
can
 
do
 
this
 
is
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
case
 
settled
 
amicably
 
so
 
that
 
.
 
.
 
.
 
no
 
case
 
will
 
be
 
filed
 
against
 
Mr.
 
Herbst.
x x x
JUDGE ASDALA:
Why did you take interest, Mr. Coronel, when the case should have been handled by the investigator of the case?
ATTY. CORONEL:
Because I believe in my mind at that time that it was Judge Asdala who called me and asked for my assistance regarding Mr. Herbst who she claimed to be a family friend and 
asked
 
me
 
if
 
possible
 
to
 
release
 
Mr.
 
Herbst
 
to
 
her
 
custody
.  That is why I asked Mr. Manansala to come to my office and if there could be a possible amicable settlement between Mr. Manansala and Mr. Herbst so that no criminal complaint could be filed against Mr. Herbst.
JUSTICE DACUDAO:
In other words, you were attempting to forge some kind of an amicable settlement?
ATTY. CORONEL:
Yes, Your Honor, I was trying to arrange an amicable settlement between Mr. Manansala and Mr. Herbst at that time.
JUSTICE DACUDAO:
Why did you do that?  What is your purpose?
ATTY. CORONEL:
I believed I spoke to Judge Asdala over the phone and then 
I
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
accommodate
 
her
 
request
 
that
 
her
 
friend
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
detained
 
any
 
longer
 
if
 
the
 
case
 
will
 
be
 
settled
 
between
 
Mr.
 
Manansala
 
and
 
Mr.
 
Herbst at
 
that
 
time.
x x x
JUDGE ASDALA:
Because actually, the reason why the complainant would file this is because of the damage, he would want that rectified, correct?
ATTY. CORONEL:
Yes, ma'm.
JUDGE ASDALA:
That is the main reason why you were trying to forge a settlement between Mr. Manansala and Mr. Herbst and not particularly because somebody called you?
ATTY. CORONEL:
I took interest in the case 
because
 
of
 
the
 
call
 
I
 
received
 
that
 
afternoon
 that is why I asked Mr. Manansala to come to my office and asked him if an amicable settlement can be arranged between him and Mr. Herbst.
JUDGE ASDALA:
So it is not for the reason that the case is actually the subject of a usual settlement that you took interest in but 
because
 
of
 
the
 
call
 
of
 
a
 
certain
 
person
 
who
 
represented
 
herself
 
as
 
Judge
 
Asdala.
 
Is
 
that
 
what
 
you
 
are
 
trying
 
to
 
say?
ATTY. CORONEL:
Yes.
x x x
JUSTICE DACUDAO:
What was the gist of the conversation?
ATTY. CORONEL:
Your Honor, I was informed by my desk officer at that time that a call from Judge Asdala was received by them and asked me if I will be willing to talk with Judge Asdala.  
I
 
received
 
that
 
call
 
and
 
I
 
spoke
 
to
 
a
 
woman
 
who
 
introduced
 
herself
 
as
 
Judge
 
Asdala
 
of
 
RTC
 
Quezon
 
City
.  And then the person over the phone asked me if I can possibly help a Mr. Herbst, a German national, who was brought in to Station 10 for investigation considering that the person is a friend of hers and 
if
 
possible,
 
Mr.
 
Herbst
 
would
 
not
 
be
 
detained
 
at
 
our
 
station.
JUSTICE DACUDAO:
You mentioned of a desk officer, what is the name of that desk officer?
ATTY. CORONEL:
At that time, the person who approached me was Police Chief Inspector Danilo Maceren, Your Honor.
JUSTICE DACUDAO:
Where is he now?
ATTY. CORONEL:
Major Maceren is now in Cosovo, Yugoslavia.  He is part of the U.N. Peace Visiting Mission.

Moreover, respondent's vacillating version regarding the phone conversation with the police officer flaws her credibility.  In her Comment to the complaint at bar, she stated that during her phone conversation with Herbst, "she heard someone in the background ask Herbst who he was in conversation with" and "[b]efore she knew it, someone other tha[n] Herbst was on the line and he introduced himself as some police officer whose name [she] cannot recall and asked what is it [she] wanted to know and who [she was] xxx."
[17]
 And during her interview on air by Atty. Mauricio, she likewise admitted having talked to a police officer in Station 10, to wit:
ATTY. BATAS MAURICIO (BMM): Welcome po kayo dito sa ating Direct Connect at kasama po natin dito si Judge Marcelino Bautista at Ginoong Melencio Manansala, at

 (pause) ah more than even a family friend because he is like a member of the family.

[18]
During the investigation conducted by Justice Dacudao, however, while Atty. Coronel was on cross-examination by respondent, respondent, in reply to the question of the Justice if she denied being the Judge Asdala who made a telephone call to the police station, evasively answered the Justice and stated that she did not speak with anybody.
JUDGE ASDALA:
So 
there
 
is
 
a
 
possibility
 
that
 
it
 
was
 
not
 
Judge
 
Asdala
 
and
 
that
 
her
 
name
 
was
 
only
 
being
 
used
 in order for you to hear her over the phone?
ATTY. CORONEL:
Yes.
JUSTICE DACUDAO:
By the way, Judge Asdala, 
are
 
you
 
denying
 
that
 
you
 
were
 
the
 
person
?
JUDGE ASDALA:
Precisely,
 
that
 
is
 
my
 
statement.
  Those are the essence of my Answer and Comment to the Complaint filed by Mr. Manansala with the office of the City Prosecutor.
JUSTICE DACUDAO:
You
 
mean
 
to
 
say
 
you
 
are
 
not
 
that
 
person
?
JUDGE ASDALA:
Not, Your Honor. 
 
I
 
did
 
not
 
speak
.
 
Even
 
in
 
the
 
interview,
 
Your
 
Honor
, 
I
 
said
 
I
 
did
 
not
 
speak
 
with
 
anybody
, I did not request anybody to release the accused to my custody because I wouldn't possibly do that, Your Honor, because I am aware of the procedure when a case is supposed to be heard for inquest, it is only the Fiscal who can order the release of the accused and not any police officer.
[19]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
As for respondent's act of 
ordering
 her sheriff to engage the assistance of policemen and retrieve Herbst's car, this Court finds that respondent should also be faulted therefor.  For by such act, she availed of the services of a government employee â 
inutusan niya
 â for private concerns.  In any event, that her sheriff was even ordered to engage the services of policemen could not have been intended other than to demonstrate her perceived might as a judge in order to hopefully secure an unimpeded release of the car.  Her claim that the sheriff was "all too willing to help" does not, even if true, 
albeit
 
the
 
sheriff's
 
testimony
 
does
 
not
 
reflect
 
such
 
claim
, extenuate her or mitigate her liability.
In fine, this Court finds well-taken the investigating Justice's evaluation of complainant's allegations.  Instead, however, of palpable abuse of authority or plain misconduct, respondent is found liable for gross misconduct constituting violation of the earlier quoted provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct, a serious charge under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended.
[20]
 Section 11 of said rule reads:
SECTION 11. Sanctions
A.   If the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions may be imposed:
 Dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned and controlled corporations,  Provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;
 Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three (3) but not exceeding six (6) months; or
 A fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00
WHEREFORE,
 respondent Judge Fatima G. Asdala, having been found 
GUILTY
 of 
GROSS MISCONDUCT
, is hereby 
FINED
 in the amount of P40,000.00 with a 
STERN WARNING
 that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.
SO ORDERED.
Davide, Jr., C.J., Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna, Chico-Nazario,

Puno, J.,
