SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


For our resolution is the petition for review on 
certiorari
 assailing the Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals dated February 17, 2003, in CA-G.R. SP No. 72958 and its Resolution
[2]
 dated June 27, 2003.
On December 19, 2001, an administrative complaint for dishonesty and gross misconduct against then Mayor Edgardo G. Flores of Minalin, Pampanga, petitioner, was filed with the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 of the same province, one of the respondents herein. The complainants were the municipal councilors of Minalin, namely: Vanzalon F. Tizon, Romulo N. Mandap, Edgardo P. Yambao, Jerome M. Tongol, Marciano L. Sacdalan, and Ricky Y. Narciso, now respondents.
The administrative complaint against petitioner alleged that on August 1, 2001, he executed Purchase Request No. 1 for the acquisition of a communication equipment amounting to P293,000.00 without any Resolution or Ordinance enacted by the 
Sangguniang Bayan
 of Minalin. The winning bidder was one Kai Electronics. On August 6, 2001, or while the bidding was still being conducted, Kai Electronics delivered the communication equipment to the municipality of Minalin. The Notice of Award of Bid to Kai Electronics states that the bidding took place also on August 1, 2001 when respondent executed the Purchase Request No. 1. The communication equipment delivered by Kai Electronics was overpriced by more than one hundred percent (100%) or in the amount of P129,600.00.
On September 9, 2002, respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 issued an Order recommending to Governor Manuel M. Lapid of Pampanga, also a respondent, that petitioner be preventively suspended from office for a period of sixty (60) days.
Without seeking a reconsideration of the Order of respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
, petitioner sent a letter dated September 12, 2002 to respondent Governor Lapid requesting him âto vetoâ the same.
Also, without waiting for respondent Governor Lapidâs action on his letter, petitioner, on September 24, 2002, filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for 
certiorari
,
[3]
 docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 72958. He contended that respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Order of preventive suspension, hence, the same should be nullified.
On February 17, 2003, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
âWHEREFORE, the instant petition is DENIED and DISMISSED for lack of merit. The assailed Order dated September 9, 2002 issued by respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 of Pampanga in Administrative Case No. 02-2001 is AFFIRMED.
SO ORDERED.â
[4]
In ruling against the petitioner, the Court of Appeals held that 
he failed to exhaust all administrative remedies before going to court.
 Moreover, respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 of Pampanga did not gravely abuse its discretion when it issued the challenged Order considering that the allegation of overpricing is supported by documentary evidence. There is also sufficient evidence to prove that the bidding and the awarding of the contract to Kai Electronics were done under questionable circumstances.
Petitioner then filed a motion for reconsideration, but this was denied by the Appellate Court in its Resolution dated June 27, 2003.
Hence, the instant petition.
The pivotal issue here is whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 72958 was prematurely filed as petitioner failed to exhaust first all administrative remedies.
Section 61 of Republic Act No. 7160 (the Local Government Code of 1991) partly provides:
âSEC. 61. 
Form and Filing of Administrative Complaints
. â A verified complaint against any erring local elective official shall be prepared as follows:
x x x;
(b) A complaint against 
any elective official of a municipality
 shall be 
filed before the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 whose decision may be appealed to the Office of the President; and
x x x.â (underscoring ours)
The administrative complaint against petitioner was filed with respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 of Pampanga in accordance with the above provision. After receiving the Order of respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 preventively suspending him from office, petitioner should have filed a motion for reconsideration in order to give the latter the opportunity to correct itself if there was any error on its part. Such motion is a condition 
sine qua non
 before filing a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended.
[5]
 Section 1 of the same Rule requires that petitioner must not only show that respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
, in issuing the questioned Order, âacted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction,â but that âthere is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.â
[6]
 We have held that the âplainâ and âadequate remedyâ referred to in Section 1 of Rule 65 is a 
motion for reconsideration
 of the assailed Order or Resolution.
[7]
 Petitioner may not arrogate to himself the determination of whether a motion for reconsideration is necessary or not.
[8]
 To dispense with the requirement of filing a motion for reconsideration, petitioner must show a concrete, compelling, and valid reason for doing so.
[9]
 This, petitioner failed to do. Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly held that petitioner should have first interposed a motion for reconsideration of the questioned Order    issued by respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
.
We must add that petitioner, before filing with the Court of Appeals his petition for 
certiorari
, should have waited for respondent Governor Lapidâs action on the recommendation of respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 that he be preventively suspended from office; and on his letter requesting the Governor to veto the questioned Order, considering that the latter is the one empowered by law to impose preventive suspension upon him. Section 63 of the Local Government Code of 1991 partly provides:
âSEC 63. 
Preventive Suspension
. â
(a) 
Preventive suspension may be imposed
:
(1) By the President, if the respondent is an elective official of a province, a highly urbanized or an independent component city;
(2) 
By the governor, if the respondent is an elective official of a
 component city or 
municipality
; or
(3) By the mayor, if the respondent is an elective official of the 
barangay
.
 x x x.â (underscoring ours)
Petitioner has not shown any valid and compelling reason why, without waiting for the Governorâs action on the matter, he immediately filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for 
certiorari
. By doing so, petitioner effectively deprived the Governor of his duty to take appropriate action on the controversy.
It is a well-settled rule that where, as here, the petitioner has available remedies within the administrative machinery against the action of an administrative board, body, or officer, the intervention of the courts can be resorted to by him only after having exhausted all such remedies.
[10]
 The rationale of this rule rests upon the presumption that the administrative body, if given the chance to correct its mistake or error, may amend its decision on a given matter and decide it properly. The strict application of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies will also prevent unnecessary and premature resort to the court.
[11]
 We cannot countenance petitionerâs utter disregard of this procedural norm and frustrate its purpose of attaining a just, speedy, inexpensive and orderly judicial proceedings.
We likewise find untenable petitionerâs contention that respondent 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 âacted capriciously and arbitrarily by reason of passion and personal hostilityâ when it issued the challenged Order âwithout constituting itself into a Committee of the Whole, as required by its rules of procedure, x x x and without a Committee Report having been prepared yet x x x.â
[12]
 Suffice it to say that this issue involves an examination of factual matters and could have been properly raised by petitioner in a motion for reconsideration of the questioned Order before the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 of Pampanga, the proper forum. But he did not do so. He thus forfeited such an important procedural remedy.
WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
DENIED.
 The appealed Decision dated February 17, 2003 and Resolution dated June 27, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 72958 are 
AFFIRMED.
