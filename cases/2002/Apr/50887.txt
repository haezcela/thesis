 For resolution is an administrative complaint filed by complainant Bienvenido R. Mercado, Director of Sta.

In a letter-complaint dated January 8, 2001 addressed to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), the complainant alleged that in implementing the said writ of execution, the respondent barged into the temporary office of the corporation which happens to be complainantâs residence, without explaining the purpose of his visit. Respondent also deprived the complainantâs wife of the opportunity to read and understand the contents of the writ of execution.  Complainant further claimed that what was levied on by the respondent were his familyâs personal belongings and not those of Sta. Clara Management and Realty Co., Inc.  According to the complainant, respondent failed to make a complete list of the personal properties he levied upon.  Complainant also alleged that according to an eyewitness, respondent delivered the personal properties that were levied upon to the house of Jesus Rana, one of the complainants in HLURB Case No. REM-111199-10770.
Lastly, complainant attached to his letter-complaint, a certification
[2]
 by the Office of the Clerk of Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City that it has not received any writ of execution issued by the HLURB in connection with HLURB Case No. REM-111199-10770, and that no payment of legal fees for the implementation of the said writ was ever made.  The same Office also certified that there is no order addressed to the respondent to enforce the said writ of execution.
In his Comment dated May 4, 2001, respondent does not deny the fact that he had implemented a writ of execution that was not addressed to him but to the Ex-Officio Sheriff or any of the Deputy Sheriffs of the RTC of Pasig City.  He explains, however, that on January 4, 2001 at around 7:30 in the morning, Ronaldo Rana and Marilou Martinez, complainants in HLURB Case No. REM-111199-10770, came to his house and requested his assistance in the implementation of the said writ.  Rana and Martinez begged for his assistance in the implementation of the writ of execution since they could not afford to pay the legal fees of the Sheriff of the RTC of Pasig City, and the complainant was about to abscond and dispose of his properties.  Respondent asserts that he was merely âacting in good faith and for humanitarian reasonsâ
[3]
 when he acceded to the request of Rana and Martinez  to implement the writ of execution free of charge.
As regards his failure to explain the purpose of his visit and to give the complainantâs wife the opportunity to read the writ of execution, respondent claims that when he served the writ to complainantâs wife, the latter refused to receive the same, and passed it on to her secretary whose signature appears thereon.  Furthermore, respondent denies the allegation that he did not make a complete inventory of the properties he levied upon.  On the contrary, a proper Inventory/Levy of the properties was made as evidenced by the Notice of Levy which was also signed by the complainantâs secretary.
The OCA found no evidence to support complainantâs allegations that: (1) the respondent did not afford his wife fair opportunity to read the writ of execution; (2) no proper inventory was made of the properties levied upon; and (3) respondent delivered the seized properties to the house of Jesus Rana.  The OCA, therefore, found no sufficient basis to hold respondent guilty of grave misconduct in implementing the writ of execution.
We agree with the OCA.
The OCA pointed out that the writ was served on and read by the complainantâs secretary who signed it when complainantâs wife refused to receive the same.  Assuming, therefore, that complainantâs wife was not able to read the writ, it  was  not due to lack of opportunity to do so but because she chose not to be informed.  Anent the alleged absence  of a complete inventory of the properties levied upon, the OCA opined that this is simply belied by the fact that the Notice of Levy containing  an inventory of the seized properties is likewise signed by complainantâs secretary.  Her signature gave rise to the presumption that she had read the inventory of the properties seized and had found the same to be accurate.  Absent a contrary statement from her, this presumption must stand.
There is also nothing in the records nor any other evidence to support complainantâs bare assertion that respondent had delivered the seized properties to the house of Jesus Rana.  As correctly pointed out by the OCA, complainant cannot have us rely on an eyewitness whose affidavit was not even presented to substantiate complainantâs accusation.
Finally, the OCA absolved respondent of any wrong doing in levying upon the properties found in complainantâs residence.  According to the OCA, the address given in the writ of execution as the companyâs address was 137 Fourth Street, Riverside Village, Pasig City.  Such being the case, the complainant could not be faulted for presuming that the properties found therein belonged to the company.  Thus, he was duty bound to levy upon them.  Complainant, in fact, does not deny that this address is the companyâs temporary business address and happens to be his residence also.  At any rate, granting that complainantâs personal properties were mistakenly levied upon, his remedy was to file a third party claim under Section 16, Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure but he did not.
It is worth reiterating here that the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt in administrative cases is substantial evidence or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion.
[4]
 Unfortunately, complainantâs unsubstantiated accusations are simply inadequate to find respondent guilty of grave misconduct in the implementation of the writ of execution.
However, we agree with the OCA that respondentâs act of implementing a writ of execution that was neither addressed to him nor coursed through the normal channels, exposed him to the suspicion that he profited therefrom and unduly favored the complainants in HLURB Case No. REM-111199-10770.
We have said that:
âThe Court cannot overstress the need for proper and circumspect behavior on everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice, form the presiding judge, to the sheriff and the lowliest clerk.  Said conduct is circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility and must, at all times, be characterized with propriety and decorum.  Every employee of the judiciary should be an example of integrity, honesty and uprightness.  He must always be above and beyond suspicion.  Sheriffs, in particular, must show a high degree of professionalism in the performance of their duties given the delicate task theyâre reposed with.â
[5]
Thus, despite respondentâs apparently good intentions, this Court cannot countenance a departure from the procedure prescribed by law that may very well incite suspicion and eventually erode the publicâs trust in the judicial system.  For this reason, respondent cannot be spared the disciplining rod of this Court.
WHEREFORE,
 respondent Sheriff Nestor Casida is fined in the amount of Two Thousand Pesos (P2,000.00) with the warning that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.
