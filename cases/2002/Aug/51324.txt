PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ Y FLORES, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




QUISUMBING, J.:


On appeal is the judgment
[1]

 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 219, in Criminal 
Case No. Q-96-66445, which found appellant Antonio de la Cruz y Flores 
guilty of rape and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay the offended party, Princess Janice Abaya, P50,000 in moral damages.  


 Appellant was a âfaith healerâ who conducted âhealingâ sessions in
 various provinces. Sometime in January 1996, he met complainantâs 
mother, Trinidad Collimar,
[2]
 
in one of these sessions. They became fast friends and appellant stayed 
from January until March 14, 1996, at Trinidadâs house in Tignoan, Real,
 Quezon, where he got to know Princess Janice, Trinidadâs minor daughter
 by her estranged common-law husband, Jerry Abaya. Princess Janice then 
was only aged 13, having been born on November 27, 1982.
[3]
 


With her motherâs permission, Princess Janice would accompany appellant, whom she called âLolo
,
â
 whenever he had healing sessions. On the average, they would be gone 
three days at a time. On March 14, 1996, appellant asked Trinidad if he 
could bring Princess Janice with him to Manila. Though classes had not 
yet ended, Trinidad gave her permission as appellant promised to buy 
clothes and school materials for Princess Janice, who was an elementary 
school pupil. Thus, appellant was able to bring Princess Janice to his 
house at No. 50 Womenâs Club Street, Sto. NiÃ±o, Galas, Quezon City. 


On June 6, 1996, Princess Janice, with the assistance of her father, filed a complaint for rape, alleging: 




That on or about the 15th day of March 1996, in Quezon City, 
Philippines, the above-named accused, by means of force and 
intimidation, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
put himself on top of complainant PRINCESS JANICE ABAYA, a minor, 
fourteen (14) years of age, who was then sleeping at the time, and 
thereafter had carnal knowledge with the undersigned complainant against
 her will and without her consent. 


Contrary to law.
[4]
 




Initially, private complainant had declared that appellant had 
ravished her three times: on March 15, 18, and 20, 1996. The preliminary
 investigation conducted by the Quezon City Prosecutorâs Office, 
however, disclosed there was probable cause to charge appellant with 
rape only for the incident of March 15, 1996. The City Prosecutor ruled 
that appellantâs acts of March 18 and 20, 1996 only constituted 
qualified seduction and acts of lasciviousness, respectively, which were
 distinct from the present case of rape. 


Complainant submitted to a medico-legal examination at the 
Philippine National Police (PNP) Central Crime Laboratory. Police Senior
 Inspector Rosaline O. Cosidon, M.D., conducted the examination. Her 
findings were as follows: 




FINDINGS: 


GENERAL AND EXTRAGENITAL: 


Fairly developed, fairly nourished and coherent female subject, 
breasts are conical with light brown areola and nipples from which no 
secretion could be pressed out. Abdomen is flat and soft. 


GENITAL: 


There is scanty growth of pubic hair. Labia majora are full, 
convex and gaping with the pinkish brown labia minora presenting in 
between. On separating the same is disclosed an elastic, fleshy type 
hymen with shallow healed lacerations at 3 and 9 oâclock. External 
vaginal orifice offers moderate resistance to the introduction of the 
examining index finger and the virgin-sized vaginal speculum. Vaginal 
canal is narrow with prominent rugosities. Cervix is normal in size, 
color and consistency. 


CONCLUSION: 


Subject is in non-virgin state physically.
[5]
 




On June 26, 1996, appellant was arraigned. He pleaded not guilty to the charge of rape. Trial then commenced. 


Testifying for the prosecution were the private complainant, her 
mother, and Dr. Rosaline Cosidon, the PNP medico-legal officer. 


Complainant testified that on March 15, 1996, at around seven 
oâclock in the evening, she was trying to sleep in an upstairs room in 
appellantâs house. With her were appellantâs sister, two of his nieces, 
and his son. She was fitfully awake, thinking of her mother, when 
appellant went up and invited her to sleep downstairs with him. She 
thought nothing of it, since she considered appellant like her own 
grandfather. She lay down beside him and was soon asleep. Later that 
night, she was awakened when she felt a sharp pain in her private parts.
 She then saw that her underwear had been lowered to her thighs and that
 appellant had inserted his penis into her vagina. He commanded her not 
to make any noise and to just keep quiet. She cried and resisted by 
pushing him away, forcing him to move back. He then warned her in a very
 stern manner not to tell anyone about what he did to her,
[6]
 and that he would kill her and her family should she tell anybody about the incident.
[7]
 Frightened, she fled upstairs and went to sleep beside the other occupants of the house. 


During her entire stay in Manila, she was not allowed to go out of 
the house. She stayed in appellantâs house until March 26, 1996 when he 
brought her back to Quezon. Upon her return to the province, she 
narrated her defilement to her best friend, a certain Rezzy Malinao.
[8]
 


On May 15, 1996, her mother brought her to Quezon City to stay with
 her father. She told her father that appellant had raped her. She also 
disclosed that she no longer wanted to stay in the province because 
people were gossiping about the rape incident. Her father immediately 
brought her to the police to lodge a complaint and had her medically 
examined.
[9]
 


Trinidad testified that appellant stayed in their home from January
 to March 14, 1996 when he left for Galas, Quezon City, with Princess 
Janice in tow. She said that she allowed her daughter to go with 
appellant because the latter was like a real father to her family.
[10]
 Moreover, he asked for her permission in a very nice way (â
Maganda po kasi ang pagpapaalam niya sa akin
.â).
[11]

 Trinidad also explained that she allowed it although classes had not 
yet ended because her daughterâs teacher assured her there was no 
problem since the final examinations were over.
[12]

 She added she brought her daughter to her fatherâs place in Galas, 
Quezon City for a vacation in May 1996. Upon returning to the province, 
she read in the newspapers about the rape charge filed by her daughter 
against appellant. She immediately rushed back to Quezon City. It was 
only then that her daughter revealed that appellant had sexually abused 
her. 


Dr. Rosaline Cosidon informed the trial court that she subjected 
private complainant to a general physical examination on May 20, 1996. 
She found that the victimâs hymen had âshallow healed laceration(s) at 
(the) 3 and 9 oâclock positions.â In her opinion, the lacerations could 
have been caused by the âforcible entry of (a) hard objectâ such as a 
fully erect phallus. Dr. Cosidon declared that it was possible the 
lacerations on the victimâs hymen happened on March 15, 1996.
[13]



  Appellant interposed in his defense an alibi. He claimed that the rape
 charges against him were instigated by complainantâs father to extort 
money from him.
[14]
 The trial court summed up his testimony as follows: 




â¦[I]t was impossible for him to have raped the complainant at the
 time, date and place stated in the complaint because 1) at the time the
 alleged act imputed to him was committed, he was somewhere else 
conducting healing sessions; 2) he usually had visitors in his house 
during those hours of the day and his housemates were still awake 
watching television; 3) the accusations were instigated by the father of
 the complainant; 4) the complainant did not immediately complain or ask
 for help; 5) that his healing power comes from the Lord in whom he has 
great fear and who can take such power away from him if he commits any 
wrongdoing; and 6) the report card of the complainant (Exh. 1) shows 
that she was attending her classes from March 14 to March 26, 1996 at 
the Tignoan Elementary School in Quezon province (TSN, August 11, 1997, 
pp. 3-6).
[15]
 




In his â
Contra-Salaysay
â dated May 21, 1996, appellant 
averred that on March 15, 1996, he was in Bagumbayan, Malinao, Albay for
 healing sessions. He stayed at the house of a certain Andrea B. Barrion
 during his stay in Albay from March 15 to April 12, 1996.
[16]
 


To corroborate appellantâs alibi, the defense presented Clarissa Sipin, Delia Bi
lolo
,
 and Jimmy Lapasi. Sipin, a niece of appellant, was allegedly staying at
 her uncleâs place in Galas at the time of the incident. Sipin averred 
that appellant could not have raped complainant in Quezon City on March 
15, 1996 as the former left for Bicol in March 1996 and did not return 
until April 17, 1996.
[17]
 She 
was sure appellant left for Albay in March 1996 because she helped him 
pack his belongings and healing paraphernalia. Moreover, complainantâs 
claim that the occupants of appellantâs house were asleep when she was 
raped at 7:00 P.M. of March 15, 1996 was not true as they usually went 
to sleep at 10:00 P.M.
[18]
 Sipin also declared that private complainant never slept at appellantâs house.
[19]
 


Bi
lolo
, the owner of the Galas house rented by appellant, affirmed the contents of her affidavit
[20]

 where she stated that sometime in March 1996, appellantâs sister had 
informed her that appellant had gone to Bicol. She said that she was 
present when appellant arrived from Bicol at around 7:00 or 8:00 A.M. of
 April 17, 1996.
[21]
 


Lapasi, in turn, testified that appellant stayed in his house in 
Bagtang, Daraga, Albay from March 2 to April 15, 1996, and never left 
the place during that period.
[22]
 


Appellant also presented Gloria Atendido, principal of Tigmuan 
Elementary School in Real, Quezon and Edna Segoma, the victimâs teacher,
 to testify on the veracity of the entries respecting complainantâs 
school attendance in her report card. 


 The trial court noted that even before the case was decided, appellant had changed his theory of the case, thus: 




â¦The thrust of his defense in his Memorandum, is that the act was
 consensual which is totally inconsistent with his defense of alibi and 
denial. He vehemently asserted that the actuations of the complainant 
before, during and after the alleged violation were not typical of [a] 
someone who abhorred the acts committed against her. Rather, they were 
characteristic of someone who had consented to and who had enjoyed the 
sexual congress. His line of argument was that because the accused had 
âfingeredâ her at least three times on March 15, 1996 before the act 
complained of was committed, her acceding to his invitation to sleep 
beside him and the manner how it was perpetrated, as pictured by her, 
show that she was a âwilling victim.â Moreover, he claimed that the 
intimate manner they had slept together and her acceding to be fingered 
again on the 20th of March support his stand. Furthermore, he cited the 
impossibility of the rape being committed by the way the complainant 
pictured it to have happened.
[23]





    On October 6, 1998, the trial court convicted appellant of the charge. The decretal portion of its decision reads:  




WHEREFORE, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 
having committed Rape, defined and punished under Article 335 of the 
Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, the Court hereby sentences 
him (1) to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua; (2) to pay the 
complainant Princess Janice Abaya the amount of P75,000.00 as moral 
damages; and (3) to pay the costs. 


SO ORDERED.
[24]
 




In convicting appellant, the trial court noted that appellantâs 
alibi was not only weak but was contradicted by the inconsistent 
testimonies of the defense witnesses. Hence, it could not prevail 
against private complainantâs positive identification singling him out 
as her ravisher. 


Now before us, appellant assigns the following errors committed by the trial court: 




I 


THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE PROSECUTION WAS ABLE TO
 PROVE THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. 


II 


THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN RELYING ON THE WEAKNESS OF THE DEFENSE IN ORDER TO GIVE MERITS TO PROSECUTIONâS EVIDENCE. 




Appellant submits that the foregoing assigned errors are 
interrelated and should be discussed jointly. We agree. The only issue 
before this Court is whether or not the trial court erred in finding 
appellant guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt, and in sentencing him 
to reclusion perpetua with the accessory penalties provided by law. 


First, appellant contends that his guilt has not been proven with 
moral certainty for failure of the prosecution to prove the elements of 
the crime. He claims that while the complaint charged him with rape 
through force and intimidation, a closer scrutiny of complainantâs 
testimony clearly shows that force and intimidation during the course of
 the coitus were inexistent. He argues that he was not armed with a 
deadly weapon. Nor did he threaten complainant with bodily harm. 
Moreover, there was no showing of any resistance on the victimâs part. 
She failed to shout for help, much less struggle during the sexual 
congress, according to him. Appellant submits that all of the foregoing 
circumstances, taken together, show not only the lack of either forcible
 compulsion or coercion on his part, but also the willingness of 
complainant to have sex with him. 


For the appellee, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) points 
out that the victim here is a 13-year-old rural lass who looked up to 
and respected appellant as her â
Lolo
â or grandfather. She 
believed appellant to be a good man, being a faith healer. She so 
trusted him that she felt secure in going alone with him to the 
metropolis. Undoubtedly, appellant exercised moral ascendancy, 
domination, and influence over her, more so as she was brought to a 
house where appellant was the main figure. The Solicitor General 
contends that given these circumstances, appellantâs moral ascendancy 
and influence over his victim, substitute for the requisite violence and
 intimidation. He stresses that the law does not impose a burden on the 
rape victim to prove resistance. 


In reviewing rape cases, we are guided by the following principles:
 (1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility, it is difficult 
to prove but more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to 
disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where
 only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant
 must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the 
prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed 
to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.
[25]
 


In convicting appellant of rape, the trial court noted âthat no 
force was applied, (but) intimidation cannot be ruled out altogether.â
[26]

 Complainant testified that she was asked by appellant to sleep beside 
him and she did as requested. She was suddenly awakened when she felt 
pain in her vagina (â
Nung natutulog ako, nagising po ako na may masakit sa pekpek ko.â
)
[27]
 only to see appellant âinserting his penis into (her) vagina.â
[28]
 


Rape is committed when the accused has carnal knowledge of a woman 
under any of the following circumstances: (1) by using force or 
intimidation; (2) when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise 
unconscious; and (3) when the woman is under twelve years of age or is 
demented.
[29]
 


In the present case, the complaint alleged that the victim of the rape âwas then sleeping at the time.â
[30]

 As earlier discussed, complainant testified under oath and in open 
court that she was asleep when appellantâs organ penetrated her 
genitals. The resulting pain in her vagina awakened her, enabling her to
 catch appellant in the act of raping her. Her testimony on this point 
was not rebutted by the defense. Thus, we are in agreement with the 
trial courtâs conclusion that there was rape. Carnal knowledge with a 
woman who is asleep constitutes rape.
[31]
 


However, appellant cannot be held liable under Article 335 (1)
[32]

 of the Revised Penal Code, because complainant was not compelled by 
appellantâs threats into having sexual relations with him. He threatened
 her only after the consummation of the sexual act. She said she pushed 
him away and appellant then forcefully told her to keep quiet regarding 
the incident, otherwise he would kill every member of her family.
[33]
 However, appellant was correctly convicted under Article 335 (2).
[34]

 What is controlling in the complaint or information is not the title of
 the complaint, nor the designation of the offense charged or of the 
particular law or part thereof violated, these being mere conclusions of
 law, but the description of the crime charged and particular facts 
therein recited.
[35]
 It can be
 readily gleaned from the complaint that the commission of rape by 
appellant in the instant case falls under the second circumstance of 
Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659 but 
before the enactment of R.A. No. 8353. 


We likewise agree with the Solicitor General that the evidence 
shows that appellant did indeed exercise a high degree of ascendancy and
 influence over the victim. However, it is unclear whether appellant 
used said ascendancy or influence to force her into submitting to his 
bestial desires. 


For his part, appellant claims that complainant did not resist his 
advances. He argues that her failure to shout for help was tantamount to
 voluntariness on her part to have sex with him. But his contention is 
belied by evidence to the contrary. Complainant categorically testified 
that she pushed appellant away when the pain in her vagina woke her up 
as she felt his phallus intruding into her private parts. This is 
unrebutted. Resistance on the part of the victim need not be carried to 
the point of inviting death or sustaining physical injuries at the hands
 of the rapist.
[36]
 
Complainantâs pushing appellant away is sufficient resistance. Besides, 
as the OSG stresses, the law does not impose upon the rape victim the 
burden of proving resistance.
[37]
 


Appellant faults complainant for her failure to immediately report 
the rape to the authorities or her parents. Appellant argues that 
complainantâs father lived in the same neighborhood in Quezon City, and 
she could have run to him to complain had she really been raped. 
However, complainantâs failure to immediately report the rape to her 
family or to the authorities does not detract from her credibility, nor 
does it mean that she fabricated the rape charge. She offered good 
reason for her hesitation. She did not know her way around Galas, Quezon
 City, having just arrived a day before the incident. Moreover, she was 
not allowed to leave appellantâs house. She could not even go back to 
Quezon province until appellant took her back on March 26, 1996. Once 
back in the province, she immediately told her best friend about the 
incident. But considering her youth, it was understandable that she 
could take no further action. Moreover, it is not uncommon for a young 
girl to conceal for some time the assault on her virtue because of the 
rapistâs threats on her life, fear of public humiliation, or lack of 
courage and composure to immediately complain that she has been sexually
 assaulted.
[38]
 


Before us, appellant maintains that the victim consented to be his 
paramour. This is a belated change of theory. His allegation is too 
shopworn to deserve serious consideration. To begin with, his shift from
 denial and alibi to the âsweetheart theory,â made apparently after 
realizing the futility of his earlier defense, is a clear indication 
that his defense is based on nothing but mere concoctions. Second, it is
 difficult to believe that a young and immature rural girl would 
willingly consent to be the mistress of a man more than four times her 
age, and whom she looks up to as her own grandfather. In rural areas of 
this country, young ladies by custom and tradition act with 
circumspection and prudence, and great caution is observed so that their
 reputation remains untainted.
[39]

 Nothing on record appears to show that complainant was a girl of loose 
morals, lacking in Filipina modesty. Having admitted the carnal act, the
 onus probandi is now on appellant to show that complainant freely 
consented to be his lover.
[40]

 As an affirmative defense, the alleged illicit affair needs convincing 
proof. The records, however, are so thread bare on this score, such that
 appellantâs latest theory could only tax oneâs credulity without 
benefit to his cause. 


Finally, we note that appellant failed to show any plausible reason
 or motive why private complainant would charge him of a serious 
offense. Absent such showing of an ill motive, complainantâs testimony 
should be upheld as worthy of full faith and credit. Complainantâs 
voluntary submission to medical examination and her willingness to 
undergo public trial where she was compelled to give out the details of 
the assault on her dignity, cannot so easily be dismissed as a mere 
concoction.
[41]
 She was 
telling the truth under oath in order that justice could prevail. 
Consequently, we have no doubt that the trial court did not err in 
convicting appellant of rape. 


As to damages, we note that the trial court ordered appellant to 
pay the victim P75,000 as moral damages. In line with current 
jurisprudence, however, the award of moral damages must be pegged at 
P50,000,
[42]
 but the victim 
ought also to be awarded another sum of P50,000 as civil indemnity. Such
 award is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape and is separate
 and distinct from the award of moral damages.
[43]
 


WHEREFORE,
 the decision of the Regional Trial 
Court of Quezon City, Branch 219, in Criminal Case No. Q-96-66445, 
finding appellant ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 
rape and sentencing him to 
reclusion perpetua
 is AFFIRMED, with
 the MODIFICATION that he is ordered to pay complainant, Princess Janice
 Abaya, the amount of P50,000 as civil indemnity and another sum of 
P50,000 as moral damages, together with the costs. 


SO ORDERED.
