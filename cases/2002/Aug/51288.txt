CONCEPCION V. VDA. DE DAFFON, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, LOURDES OSMEÃA VDA. DE DAFFON, AILEEN DAFFON, JOSELITO DAFFON, JR., ANA VANESA DAFFON, LEILA DAFFON AND SUZETTE DAFFON, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:




Petitioner Concepcion Villamor was married to the late Amado 
Daffon, with whom she begot one son, Joselito Daffon. Joselito married 
Lourdes OsmeÃ±a, and they bore six children, namely, Aileen, Joselito 
Jr., Ana Vanesa, Leila, Julius and Suzette.  


 Amado passed away on January 21, 1982. His son, Joselito, died on October 25, 1990. 


On January 21, 1994, respondents Lourdes OsmeÃ±a Vda. De Daffon, 
together with her six minor children, instituted an action for partition
 against petitioner Concepcion Villamor Vda. de Daffon, which case was 
docketed as Civil Case No. DNA-281 of the Regional Trial Court of Danao 
City, Branch 25.
[1]
 
Respondents alleged that Amado left several real and personal properties
 which formed part of his conjugal partnership with petitioner. Joselito
 being a forced heir of Amado was entitled to at least one half of 
Amadoâs estate, consisting of his share in the said conjugal properties.
 However, the said properties were never partitioned between petitioner 
and Joselito. After Joselitoâs death, petitionerâs behavior towards 
respondents, her daughter-in-law and grandchildren, changed. She claimed
 absolute ownership over all the properties and deprived them of the 
fruits thereof. Thus, respondents prayed that the conjugal properties of
 Amado Daffon and petitioner be partitioned and that the one-half share 
of Amado be further partitioned between petitioner, on one hand, and the
 respondents as heirs of Joselito Daffon, on the other hand. 


Petitioner filed a Motion to Dismiss on the grounds of (1) lack of 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case; (2) failure of the 
complaint to state a cause of action; and (3) waiver, abandonment and 
extinguishment of the obligation.
[2]

 She argued that the trial court cannot take cognizance of the action 
for partition considering her claim of absolute ownership over the 
properties; and that respondents themselves admitted that petitioner has
 repudiated the co-ownership. Anent the third ground, petitioner alleged
 that Joselito Daffon filed a complaint against Milagros Marin, who was 
likewise married to Amado Daffon, for recovery of a parcel of land in 
Mandaluyong.
[3]
 In said 
complaint, respondent Lourdes OsmeÃ±a Vda. de Daffon allegedly admitted 
that the land sought was the only property of the late Amado Daffon. 


In an Order dated July 22, 1994, the trial court denied the Motion to Dismiss.
[4]
 Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration which was also denied on September 23, 1994.
[5]
 


On October 25, 1994, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari 
with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 35536. On November
 14, 1996, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed decision denying 
due course and dismissing the petition for certiorari.
[6]
 Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated April 21, 1997.
[7]
 


The case is now before us on petition for review, based on the following issues: 




I 


THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT 
PRIVATE RESPONDENTS NEED NOT BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS HEIRS OF THE DECEASED 
AMADO DAFFON. 


II 


THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT IT 
IS NOT NECESSARY THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENTS BE THE REGISTERED OWNERS OF 
THE PROPERTIES CLAIMED IN THE ACTION FOR PARTITION. 


III 


THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE
 TRIAL COURT IS NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE OF ANOTHER CASE 
PENDING IN ANOTHER COURT. 


IV 


THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT
 THE TRIAL COURTâS DENIAL OF PETITIONERâS MOTION TO DISMISS THE 
COMPLAINT BASED ON FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION IS REVIEWABLE BY 
THE SPECIAL CIVIL ACTION OF CERTIORARI.
[8]
 




There is no merit in the petition. 


It should be stressed that in the determination of whether a 
complaint fails to state a cause of action, only the statements in the 
complaint may be properly considered.
[9]

 Moreover, a defendant who moves to dismiss the complaint on the ground 
of lack of cause of action hypothetically admits all the averments 
thereof. The test of sufficiency of the facts found in a complaint as 
constituting a cause of action is whether or not admitting the facts 
alleged the court can render a valid judgment upon the same in 
accordance with the prayer thereof. The hypothetical admission extends 
to the relevant and material facts well pleaded in the complaint and 
inferences fairly deducible therefrom. Hence, if the allegations in the 
complaint furnish sufficient basis by which the complaint can be 
maintained, the same should not be dismissed regardless of the defense 
that may be assessed by the defendants.
[10]
 


In the case at bar, the complaint sufficiently alleged that 
âdefendant (i.e., petitioner herein) was married to Amado Quiros Daffonâ
 and that âthey begot an only son in Joselito Daffon.â
[11]

 The complaint further alleged that âJoselito Daffon later got married 
to herein plaintiff Lourdes OsmeÃ±a and before the former died on October
 25, 1990 he sired the six (6) children who are now plaintiffs with 
their mother.â
[12]
 This, to 
our mind, was sufficient allegation that Joselito Daffon was a 
legitimate son of the spouses Amado and Concepcion Daffon; and that 
plaintiffs (i.e., respondents herein) were likewise legitimate heirs of 
Joselito Daffon. Admitting the truth of these averments, there was, 
therefore, no need to inquire whether respondent minor children were 
duly acknowledged by the deceased Amado Daffon. To be sure, the 
illegitimacy of the said children and the lack of acknowledgment are 
matters which petitioner may raise as a defense in her answer and 
threshed out by the court during a full-blown trial. 


In the same vein, there is no need for the complaint to 
specifically allege respondentsâ claim of co-ownership of the 
properties. The complaint needs only to allege the ultimate facts on 
which the plaintiffs rely for their claim.
[13]
 




The rules of procedure require that the complaint must make a 
concise statement of the ultimate facts or the essential facts 
constituting the plaintiffâs cause of action. A fact is essential if it 
cannot be stricken out without leaving the statement of the cause of 
action inadequate. A complaint states a cause of action only when it has
 its three indispensable elements, namely: (1) a right in favor of the 
plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law it arises or is 
created; (2) an obligation on the part of the named defendant to respect
 or not to violate such right; and (3) an act or omission on the part of
 such defendant violative of the right of plaintiff or constituting a 
breach of the obligation of defendant to the plaintiff for which the 
latter may maintain an action for recovery of damages.
[14]
 




The allegations contained therein are sufficient to establish 
respondentsâ right to the estate of Amado Daffon. By stating their 
relationship to the deceased, they established their line of succession 
as the basis for their claim. Their rights to succeed as heirs were 
transmitted from the moment of death of the decedent.
[15]
 


Contrary to petitionerâs contention, the fact that she repudiated 
the co-ownership between her and respondents did not deprive the trial 
court of jurisdiction to take cognizance of the action for partition. In
 a complaint for partition, the plaintiff seeks, first, a declaration 
that he is a co-owner of the subject properties; and second, the 
conveyance of his lawful shares.
[16]

 As the Court of Appeals correctly held, an action for partition is at 
once an action for declaration of co-ownership and for segregation and 
conveyance of a determinate portion of the properties involved. If the 
defendant asserts exclusive title over the property, the action for 
partition should not be dismissed. Rather, the court should resolve the 
case and if the plaintiff is unable to sustain his claimed status as a 
co-owner, the court should dismiss the action, not because the wrong 
remedy was availed of, but because no basis exists for requiring the 
defendant to submit to partition. If, on the other hand, the court after
 trial should find the existence of co-ownership among the parties, the 
court may and should order the partition of the properties in the same 
action.
[17]
 




An action for partition is comprised of two phases: first, an 
order for partition which determines whether a co-ownership in fact 
exists, and whether partition is proper; and, second, a decision 
confirming the sketch or subdivision submitted by the parties or the 
commissioners appointed by the court, as the case may be. The first 
phase of a partition and/or accounting suit is taken up with the 
determination of whether or not a co-ownership in fact exists, (i.e., 
not otherwise legally proscribed) and may be made by voluntary agreement
 of all the parties interested in the property. This phase may end with a
 declaration that plaintiff is not entitled to have a partition either 
because a co-ownership does not exist, or partition is legally 
prohibited. It may end, upon the other hand, with an adjudgment that a 
co-ownership does in truth exist, partition is proper in the premises 
and an accounting of rents and profits received by the defendant from 
the real estate in question is in order. In the latter case, the parties
 may, if they are able to agree, make partition among themselves by 
proper instruments of conveyance, and the court shall confirm the 
partition so agreed upon.
[18]
 




Petitioner insists that in her testimony given in Civil Case No. 
56336, respondent Lourdes Daffon admitted that the land in Mandaluyong 
was the only property left by the deceased Amado Daffon. The pertinent 
portion of her testimony runs this way: 




Q     And because of that incident being the surviving spouse of 
Joselito Daffon, how did it affect you personally and also your husband 
at that time when he was still alive? 


A     She (
sic
) felt sad and she (
sic
) suffered
 mental torture, mental anxiety and numerous sleepless nights for that 
is the only property left to us by my father-in-law and his son and his 
grandchildren.
[19]
 




We do not agree with petitionerâs interpretation of the above 
phrase. The foregoing statement, saying that the deceased only left the 
said Mandaluyong property to his son Joselito, does not exclude the 
possibility that Amado owned other land and personal belongings during 
his lifetime, which he may not have left to his son. This does not 
deprive Joselito or his successors-in-interest of the right to share in 
those other properties. As a matter of fact, respondentsâ complaint 
contains a long list of properties allegedly owned by Amado Daffon.
[20]

 Again, the resolution of whether or not these belonged to Amado Daffon 
and formed part of his estate is a matter best taken up during trial and
 after an evaluation of the evidence to be presented by the contending 
parties. 


Petitioner argues that the order which denied the Motion to Dismiss
 is an interlocutory order which is not appealable. Hence, it may be the
 subject of a special civil action for certiorari. However, for 
certiorari to lie, it must be convincingly proved that the lower court 
committed grave abuse of discretion, or an act too patent and gross as 
to amount to an evasion of a positive duty, or a virtual refusal to 
perform the duty enjoined or act in contemplation of law; or that the 
trial court exercised its power in an arbitrary and despotic manner by 
reason of passion and personal hostility.
[21]

 In the case at bar, the trial court did not commit grave abuse of 
discretion in denying petitionerâs Motion to Dismiss. Thus, the Court of
 Appeals was correct in dismissing the petition for certiorari. 


We are indeed distressed by the circumstances under which the 
instant case reached this Court. Instead of filing an answer and meeting
 the issues head-on, petitioner and her counsel chose to elevate the 
incident of the denial of the Motion to Dismiss to the higher courts. In
 doing so, they effectively delayed the resolution of the case and the 
adjudication of the respective rights of the parties by the court below.
 What makes this case more reprehensible is that petitioner abused the 
legal process to delay her own grandchildrenâs expectancy to share in 
the estate left by their father and grandfather. If there is any merit 
in her claim of absolute ownership over the contested properties, she 
could have just allowed the case to be fully tried, during which she 
should have proved her case with competent proof. While litigants may 
utilize all available means to defend themselves, the legal strategies 
they employ should not amount to machinations which frustrate and 
prejudice the rights of others. Moreover, frivolous appeals, such as the
 one filed in this case, are not countenanced in this jurisdiction. 


WHEREFORE,
 in view of the foregoing, the instant 
petition is DENIED. The decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP 
No. 35536 is AFFIRMED. 


SO ORDERED.
