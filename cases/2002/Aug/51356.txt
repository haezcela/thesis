QUISUMBING, J.:




On appeal is the decision
[1]
  of the Court of Appeals promulgated on August 
25, 1999 in CA-G.R. CV No. 45002, which affirmed 
in 
toto

 the judgment of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 62, in Civil
 Case No. 16062. The trial court found herein petitioners liable for the
 death of Florentina Sabalburo in a vehicular accident involving a 
passenger bus owned by petitioner Metro Manila Transit Corporation 
(MMTC) and driven by petitioner Apolinario Ajoc, and ordered them to pay
 damages to private respondents.  


 The factual backdrop of this case, as found by the Court of 
Appeals, is as follows: 




The eyewitness account of plaintiffsâ witness, Maria 
Zenaida 
Baylon, tends to show that in the afternoon of December 24, 1986, she, 
her daughter Maria Zenia and the victim, Florentina Sabalburo, were on 
their way to Baclaran to buy foodstuffs for their 
Noche 
Buena
. For some time, they stood on the island at the 
intersection of St. Andrews Street
[2]

 and Domestic Road, [Pasay City] waiting for the traffic light to change
 so they could cross to the other side of St. Andrews Street where they 
intended to take a ride for Baclaran. When the traffic light turned red 
and the vehicles along St. Andrews Street had stopped, the three of them
 stepped off the island. Just as they started to cross the street, she 
(Baylon) saw an MMTC bus coming from their right (Tramo) which was 
moving at a fast speed. The next moment, the left front portion of the 
bus hit the victim on the right side of her head. The impact was of such
 force that the victimâs right ear was slashed off and she thereupon 
fell on the cement and became unconscious. The victim was brought by the
 bus driver, Apolinario Ajoc and the bus conductress to the San Juan de 
Dios Hospital where she was given medical attention. Florentina 
Sabalburo never regained consciousness and it was on January 3, 1987 
that she succumbed to her injuries.
[3]
 




On February 16, 1987, private respondents filed a 
complaint
[4]

 for damages against MMTC and its driver, Ajoc, with the Regional Trial 
Court of Makati. Docketed as Civil Case No. 16062, the complaint 
essentially alleged that Ajoc drove the MMTC bus in a wanton and 
reckless manner, in gross violation of traffic rules and regulations, 
without due regard for the safety of others, thus causing the untimely 
death of the victim. 


Petitioners denied the material allegations of the complaint,
 
disclaimed any liability for the incident, and insisted that the 
accident was solely due to the victimâs own negligence. The appellate 
court summed up their version of the incident as follows: 




x x x 


That at the time material to this case, bus no. 033, with 
defendant Ajoc driving, then bound towards the direction of Baclaran 
proper, was slowly accelerating speed on the outer right lane of the 
road, in response to the go signal of the traffic light situated in the 
intersection of Domestic Road [and Andrew Avenue], while the vehicles on
 the inner right lane which were going to turn left towards Domestic 
Road were at a stop position, the deceased FLORENTINA G. SABALBURO, 
whose stationary position was then covered from Ajocâs peripheral vision
 by a big truck then bound to MIA Road [that] was at a stop position, 
suddenly, without regard to her own safety and in total defiance of 
traffic signs designed to protect pedestrian[s], suddenly darted across 
the road; Ajoc, thus caught by surprise, tried to prevent impact by 
releasing his accelerator pedal and applying his brakes but the time lag
 between the deceasedâs negligent act and Ajocâs prudent and diligent 
reaction to the former made the impact a certainty.
[5]
 




As special and affirmative defenses, petitioners also claimed
 that: 


(1) MMTC âhires its drivers, conductors and other employees 
only 
after they have successfully passed rigid and extensive theoretical and 
practical examinations designed to determine their skills and 
competenceâ¦and imposes upon its drivers the duty to undergo regular 
seminars in defensive driving techniques and road safety habits;â
[6]
 


(2) MMTC had âtaken every human care and foresight possible 
in 
carrying their passengers safely to their respective place (sic) of 
destination as well as in avoiding harm to the life and limbs or risk 
against pedestrians so that they not be held liable;â
[7]
 and 


(3) â[T]he buses of the defendant corporation, including its 
bus 
no. 033 were all properly maintainedâ¦before the buses left the garage 
for their respective routes on that particular day, as in all other 
days, they were rigidly inspected and examined and properly certified as
 roadworthy.â
[8]




The trial court found private respondentsâ version more 
credible and on August 12, 1993, decided the case as follows: 




WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered
 in favor of the plaintiff and against defendants as follows: 




 Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay 
plaintiff 
Martin Sabalburo actual damages in the sum of P63,943.88 representing 
the unpaid expenses of plaintiff in connection with the death of 
Florentina Sabalburo; 
    
  
 Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay
 
plaintiffs the sum of P180,000.00 for the loss of the earning capacity 
of the deceased for a period of ten (10) years; 
    
  
 Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay
 plaintiff Martin Sabalburo the amount of P500,000.00 as moral damages; 
    
  
 Ordering defendants to jointly and severally pay
 plaintiff Martin Sabalburo the sum of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages; 
    
  
 Ordering defendants [to] jointly and severally 
pay plaintiff Martin Sabalburo the sum of P50,000.00 as attorneyâs fees;
 
  
 Ordering defendants jointly and severally to pay
 plaintiffs the costs of this suit.
 
  SO ORDERED.
[9]


Petitioners seasonably appealed to the Court of Appeals, which 
docketed their appeal as CA-G.R. CV No. 45002. Before the appellate 
court, petitioners insisted that the accident was solely the fault of 
the victim since she suddenly crossed a very busy street with complete 
disregard for her safety and in violation of traffic rules and 
regulations designed to protect pedestrians. 


As earlier stated, the appellate court, in CA-G.R. CV No. 
45002, affirmed the trial courtâs decision, thus: 




IN JUDGMENT, we hold that the appeal interposed by 
appellants is 
not meritorious and the judgment of the lower court which we find to be 
in accordance with law and the evidence is therefore AFFIRMED in toto. 
Costs against appellants. 


SO ORDERED.
[10]
 




Petitioners then moved for reconsideration, but the appellate
 court denied their motion in its resolution of December 10, 
1999.
[11]




Hence, the present petition. 


Petitioners submit as sole issue for our resolution the 
following: 




WHETHER OR NOT ARTICLE 2179
[12]
 AS AN EXCEPTION TO ARTICLE 2176
[13]
 OF THE CIVIL CODE IS 
APPLICABLE IN THE INSTANT CASE. 




Petitioners insist that a closer look at the facts 
established by 
the trial court would show that the incident happened at around 3:30 in 
the afternoon of December 24, 1986 or barely eight (8) hours before 
Christmas Eve. Thus, the victimâs thoughts were naturally directed 
towards the 
Noche Buena
. The victim then crossed 
busy Andrew 
Avenue for the purpose of getting a ride to Baclaran to buy food for the
 Christmas Eve celebration. Since her thoughts were on the Christmas Eve
 feast, she crossed where there was no pedestrian lane and while the 
green light for vehicular traffic was on. Petitioner MMTC submits that 
petitioner Ajoc cannot be charged with negligence considering that he 
cannot see what is in the mind of a pedestrian. Considering that the 
victimâs own negligence was the direct and proximate cause of her 
injuries and untimely demise, it was error for the Court of Appeals not 
to have applied Article 2179 of the Civil Code to the instant case. 


  Petitionersâ claim that at the time of the incident, the victimâs mind
 was preoccupied with the preparations for the 
Noche 
Buena
,
 is naught but pure conjecture and speculation, with nary a scintilla of
 proof to support it, according to respondents. Both the trial and 
appellate courts established that the immediate and proximate cause of 
the victimâs death was the negligent and careless driving by petitioner 
Ajoc. Therefore, the full force of Article 2176 of the Civil Code 
applies, concluded respondents. 


In asking us to apply Article 2179 of the Civil Code, we note
 that 
petitioners are asking us to make a finding that the victimâs own 
negligence was the direct and proximate cause of her death. This we 
cannot do. The issue of whether a person is negligent or not is a 
question of fact.
[14]
 The Supreme Court is not a trier of 
facts,
[15]

 although it has the power and authority to review and reverse the 
factual findings of lower courts where these do not conform to the 
evidence
[16]
 or 
where the courts below came up with contradictory factual 
findings.
[17]




We have thoroughly perused the records of this case, and 
nowhere do
 we find evidence to support petitionersâ claim that the victim was so 
engrossed in thinking about 
Noche Buena
 while 
crossing a busy street. Petitionersâ stance regarding the victimâs 
alleged negligence is 
non sequitur
.
 It simply does not follow that one who is run over by a vehicle on 
Christmas Eve (or any other holiday for that matter) is negligent 
because his thoughts were on the holiday festivities. 


Instead, the records support private respondentsâ claim that 
the 
MMTC bus was being driven carelessly. As found by the trial court and 
affirmed by the Court of Appeals, the victim and her companions were 
standing on the island of Andrew Avenue, waiting for the traffic light 
to change so they could cross. Upon seeing the red light, the victim and
 her companions started to cross. It was then when petitioner Ajoc, who 
was trying to beat the red light, hit the victim. As the court a quo 
noted, Ajocâs claim that âhe failed to see the victim and her companions
 proves his recklessness and lack of caution in driving his 
vehicle.â
[18]

 Findings of fact of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the 
Court of Appeals, are binding and conclusive on the Supreme 
Court.
[19]

 More so, as in this case, where petitioners have not adequately shown 
that the courts below overlooked or disregarded certain facts or 
circumstances of such import as would have altered the outcome of the 
case. Contrary to petitionersâ insistence, the applicable law in this 
case is Article 2176 of the Civil Code and not Article 2179. 


Petitioner MMTC next contends that the Court of Appeals erred
 in 
finding it solidarily liable for damages with its driver/employee, Ajoc,
 pursuant to the relevant paragraphs of Article 2180
[20]

 of the Civil Code. It argues that the act of Ajoc in bringing the 
victim to a hospital reflects MMTCâs diligence in the selection and 
supervision of its drivers, particularly with regard to safety measures.
 Hence, having exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in 
the selection and supervision of its employees to prevent damage, MMTC 
should not be held vicariously liable.


It should be stressed, however, that whenever an employeeâs 
negligence causes damage or injury to another, there instantly arises a 
presumption 
juris tantum
 that there was negligence 
on the part 
of the employer, either in the selection of the employee (culpa in 
eligiendo) or the supervision over him after the selection (culpa in 
vigilando).
[21]
 
Hence, to 
escape solidary liability for a quasi-delict committed by his employee, 
an employer must rebut the presumption by presenting convincing proof 
that in the selection and supervision of his employee, he has exercised 
the care and diligence of a good father of a family.
[22]
 In the present case, 
petitioner MMTC failed to rebut the presumption of negligence on its 
part. 


The claim that Ajocâs act of bringing the victim to the 
nearest 
medical facility shows adequate supervision by MMTC over its employees 
deserves but scant consideration. For one, the act was after the fact of
 negligence on Ajocâs part. For another, the evidence on record shows 
that Ajocâs act was neither voluntary nor spontaneous; he had to be 
prevailed upon by the victimâs companions to render assistance to his 
victim.
[23]
 
Moreover, the 
evidence to show that MMTC had exercised due diligence in the selection 
and supervision of its employees consisted merely of the pertinent 
guidelines for the screening and selection of its drivers, as well as 
periodic seminars on road safety. As found by the trial court, and 
affirmed by the appellate court, petitioner MMTC failed to show that its
 driver, Ajoc, had actually undergone such screening or had attended 
said seminars. As previously held, â[t]he mere formulation of various 
company policies on safety without showing that they were being complied
 with is not sufficient to exempt (an employer) from liability arising 
from negligence of its employees. It is incumbent upon petitioner to 
show that in recruiting and employing the erring driver the recruitment 
procedures and company policies on efficiency and safety were 
followed.â
[24]

 In this case, MMTC has made no satisfactory showing that it had paid 
more than lip service to its guidelines and policies in hiring and 
supervision. Its failure to do so cannot but warrant the proper 
sanctions from this Court, considering that MMTC is a government-owned 
public utility organized for the public welfare. Having failed to rebut 
the presumption of negligence on its part, MMTC is primarily and 
directly liable for the damages caused by its employee, the erring 
driver, Ajoc, pursuant to Article 2180 of the Civil Code, which provides
 as follows: 




ART. 2180. The obligation imposed by Article 2176 is 
demandable 
not only for oneâs own acts or omissions-, but also for those of persons
 for whom one is responsible. 


The father and, in case of his death or incapacity, the 
mother, 
are responsible for the damages caused by the minor children who live in
 their company. 


Guardians are liable for damages caused by the minors or 
incapacitated persons who are under their authority and live in their 
company. 


The owners and managers of an establishment or enterprise 
are 
likewise responsible for damages caused by their employees in the 
service of the branches in which the latter are employed or on the 
occasion of their functions. 


Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their 
employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their 
assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business 
or industry. 


The State is responsible in like manner when it acts 
through a 
special agent; but not when the damage has been caused by the official 
to whom the task done properly pertains, in which case what is provided 
in Article 2176 shall be applicable. 


Lastly, teachers or heads of establishments of arts and 
trades 
shall be liable for damages caused by their pupils and students or 
apprentices, so long as they remain in their custody. 


The responsibility treated of in this article shall cease 
when 
the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence 
of a good father of a family to prevent damage. 




The owners of public utilities fall within the scope of this 
article.
[25]

 As earlier stated, MMTC is a public utility, organized and owned by the
 government for public transport service. Hence, its liability to 
private respondents, for the negligent and reckless acts of its driver, 
Ajoc, under Article 2180 of the Civil Code is both manifest and clear. 



WHEREFORE,
 the instant petition 
is DISMISSED. The 
assailed decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 45002 is 
AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioners. 


SO ORDERED.

When the plaintiffâs own negligence was the immediate and proximate 
cause of his injury, he cannot recover damages. But if his negligence 
was only contributory, the immediate and proximate cause of the injury 
being the defendantâs lack of due care, the plaintiff may recover 
damages, but the courts shall mitigate the damages to be awarded.

Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault

negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the
 parties, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of 
this Chapter.
