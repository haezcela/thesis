ADR SHIPPING SERVICES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. MARCELINO
GALLARDO AND THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




QUISUMBING,
J.:




Petitioner ADR Shipping Services, Inc., seeks to reverse and set aside the 
decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. CV No. 47556 dated October 9, 1996, which affirmed 
in toto
 the 
judgment of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 50, in Civil Case No. 
88-43931, for sum of money and damages. 


Culled from the records, the following are the antecedent facts: 


Marcelino Gallardo, a timber concessionaire and log dealer doing business 
under the name âMar Gallardo Tradingâ, entered into a charter agreement with ADR 
Shipping Services, Inc., through its president Abraham Rodriguez, for the use of 
the MV Pacific Breeze to transport 60,000 cubic meters of logs to Kaoshung, 
Taiwan. These logs were the subject of a sales agreement
[2]
 between Gallardo as seller and Stywood 
Philippines, Inc., as buyer. Gallardo paid an advance charter fee of P242,000 
representing ten percent of the agreed charter fee, evidenced by two official 
receipts
[3]
 issued by ADR to Mar Gallardo 
Trading. Under the charter agreement, the boat should be ready to load by 
February 5, 1988. 


MV Pacific Breeze failed to arrive on time. Consequently, Gallardo sent a 
letter dated February 5, 1988 to ADR stating: 




Kindly be informed that we are cancelling the charter contract we signed in 
view of the failure of STYWOOD to fulfill its commitment with us. Since the 
vessel would be arriving on February 19 or 20 certainly you can still have 
sufficient time to notify the owner. 


As a consequence of this cancellation, we are constrained to withdraw the 
amount we deposited on January 28 and 29 of this year in the total amount of 
P242,000.00 


Thank you very much.
[4]


Due to ADRâs refusal to return the P242,000 already advanced by Gallardo, the 
latter filed a case for sum of money and damages, docketed as Civil Case No. 
88-43931 in the RTC of Manila, Branch 50. After trial, the trial court rendered 
its decision, thus: 




WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendant ADR Shipping 
Services, Inc. to pay plaintiff the sum of P242,000.00 with 6% interest per 
annum from date of filing of the complaint, plus P20,000.00 as attorneyâs fees 
and the costs of suit. 


SO ORDERED.
[5]


On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court in a 
decision dated October 9, 1996. ADRâs motion for reconsideration was denied by 
the appellate court on July 29, 1998. 
Hence, this petition for review 
anchored on the following assignment of errors: 


I 


THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN FINDING 
PRIVATE RESPONDENT MARCELINO GALLARDO IS (SIC) ENTITLED TO THE REFUND OF THE 
P210,000.00 AND THE P32,000.00 PAID TO ADR SHIPPING SERVICES INC. AS 10% ADVANCE 
FREIGHT OF MV PACIFIC BREEZE. 


II 


THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN FINDING THAT 
PRIVATE RESPONDENT MARCELINO GALLARDO HAS NO KNOWLEDGE NOR HAVE (SIC) CONSENTED 
TO THE AGREEMENT THAT STYWOOD PHILIPPINE INDUSTRIES INC. FORMALLY TAKE OVER THE 
CHARTER PARTY ON THE MV PACIFIC BREEZE. 


III 


THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN NOT FINDING 
NOVATION WITH THE TAKE OVER OF STYWOOD PHILIPPINE INDUSTRIES INC. OF THE CHARTER 
PARTY ON THE MV PACIFIC BREEZE. 


IV 


GRANTING, ARGUENDO, THAT THERE WAS NO NOVATION OR SUBSTITUTION 
OF THE VESSEL TO PERFORM THE CARGO TRANSPORT REQUIREMENTS OF GALLARDO AND/OR 
STYWOOD PHIL INDUSTRIES, INC., THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED 
THAT BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND CHARTER CONTRACT OF MV PACIFIC BREEZE, GALLARDO 
IS NOT ENTITLED TO ANY REFUND AFTER HE FILED A NOTICE OF CANCELLATION BEFORE THE 
CANCELLING DATE OF 16 FEBRUARY 1988.
[6]


The issue for resolution is whether or not private respondent Gallardo is 
entitled to the refund in the sum of P242,000 representing his deposit for the 
charter of the ship provided by petitioner ADR. 


Petitioner asserts that under the terms of the Charter Party for MV Pacific 
Breeze, Gallardo as the charterer had the option to cancel the Charter Party 
only when the vessel failed to arrive or was not ready to load after February 
16, 1988, citing paragraph 10 thereof, which provides: 




10. CANCELLING CLAUSE 


Should the vessel not be ready to load (whether in berth or not) on or before 
the date indicated in Box 19 [
16 February, 1988
], Charterers 
have the option of cancelling this contract, such option to be declared, if 
demanded, at least 48 hours before vesselâs expected arrival at port of loading. 
Should the vessel be delayed on account of average or otherwise. Charterers to 
be informed as soon as possible, and if the vessel is delayed for more than 10 
days after the day she is stated to be expected ready to load, Charterers have 
the option of cancelling this contract, unless a cancelling date has been agreed 
upon.
[7]
 (Emphasis ours.) 



Petitioner argues, on one hand, that the date â5 February 1988â, written in 
Box No. 9 of the charter party, merely indicates a âreference commencing dateâ 
from which the chartered vessel is expected and ready to load, and not the exact 
date when the vessel has to arrive as indicated in paragraph 10 of the charter 
party as quoted above. On the other hand, private respondent contends that the 
charter party, in Box No. 9 thereof, has unequivocally fixed February 5, 1998 as 
the date when MV Pacific Breeze is expected ready to load. In this regard, we 
are not persuaded by petitionerâs argument, and we find in favor of private 
respondent. 


Paragraph 10 of the âGenconâ Charter Party, in our view, contains a 
typographical error where âBox 19â was erroneously written instead of âBox 9â. 
But more importantly, paragraph 10 presents an ambiguity. Ambiguities in a 
contract are interpreted strictly, albeit not unreasonably, against the drafter 
thereof when justified in light of the operative facts and surrounding 
circumstances.
[8]
 In this case, such 
ambiguity must be construed strictly against ADR, the party that drafted and 
caused the inclusion of the subject clause. 


More decisive is the stipulation in Box No. 9 of the Charter Party which 
explicitly states that 
February 5, 1988 is the date when the vessel is 
âexpected ready to load.â
[9]
 February 16, 1988 is merely the 
âcancelling dateâ
 as specified in Box 19 of the said contract.
[10]
 That February 5, 1988 is the intended 
date when the ship is expected ready to load, is buttressed by the provision of 
paragraph 1 of the âGenconâ Charter which states: 




1. It is agreed between the party mentioned in Box 3 as Owners of the steamer 
or motor-vessel named in Box 5, of the gross/net Register tons indicated in Box 
6 and carrying about the number of tons of deadweight cargo stated in Box 7, now 
in position as stated in Box 8 
and expected ready to load under this 
Charter about the date indicated in Box 9
, [February 5, 1988] and the 
party mentioned as Charterers in Box 4 that: 


The said vessel shall proceed to the loading port or place stated in Box 10 
or so near thereto as she may safely get and lie always afloat, and there load a 
full and complete cargo â¦.
[11]
 (Emphasis 
supplied.) 


Considering that the subject contract contains the foregoing express 
provision that February 5, 1988 is the date when the vessel is expected ready to 
load, that provision leaves the parties with no other recourse but to apply the 
literal meaning of such stipulation. The cardinal rule is that where the terms 
of the contract are clear, leaving no doubt as to the intention of the 
contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations is controlling.
[12]


ADR asserts further that a subsequent agreement was forged among ADR, 
Gallardo and Stywood for Stywood to take over the charter contract from 
Gallardo.
[13]
 In support of its claim, 
petitioner produced in court a copy of the document embodying the alleged 
agreement, to wit: 




AGREEMENT 


TO: ADR SHIPPING SERVICES 


Room 304 Ermita Center Building 


Roxas Blvd., Manila 


This is to certify that I have appointed STYWOOD PHILIPPINE INDUSTRIES with 
office address of 7 D Vernida 1, 120 Amorsolo St. Legaspi Village Makati Metro 
Manila, to have full authority to use the Charter Vessel âMV PACIFIC BREEZEâ 
Singaporean Flag in case that I cannot push through with my shipment of FALCATA 
Logs that is expected to be loaded by February 5,
[14]
 1988. 


This agreement is valid upon if I cannot meet the requirements given to me as 
stated above and other previous contracts. 


MAR GALLARDO TRADING 


(SGD.) Marcelino C. Gallardo 


PRESIDENT
[15]


On the strength of the above-mentioned agreement, says petitioner, ADR and 
Stywood entered into a Charter Party on February 11, 1988,
[16]
 for the loading of the same falcata logs 
for which the MV Pacific Breeze was initially engaged, this time on board the MV 
Adhiguna Dharma. Hence, the P242,000 advanced by Gallardo for the freight of MV 
Pacific Breeze was applied to MV Adhiguna Dharma, which is the substitute vessel 
for MV Pacific Breeze.
[17]
 Accordingly, 
ADR now claims that Gallardo lost his legal personality to file the instant 
case. 


On this point, both the RTC and the CA found no evidence, testimonial or 
otherwise, to prove the genuineness and due execution of Exhibit 3, the 
so-called take-over agreement. Factual findings of the trial court, especially 
when affirmed by the appellate court, are binding upon us
[18]
 and entitled to utmost respect.
[19]
 Moreover, nothing on record has been 
shown to us by petitioner to warrant a reversal of the CAâs conclusion negating 
the genuineness and due execution of the disputed document. Such conclusion is 
supported by the evidence on record. 


First, the purported take-over agreement was not notarized. Thus, it is not a 
public document and, by law, not entitled to full faith and credit upon its 
face. Second, said document is undated, creating grave doubt as to its 
authenticity. Third, we agree with the appellate courtâs finding that the 
alleged signature of respondent Gallardo in Exhibit 3 is different from his 
signature appearing in the records of this case, particularly in the Falcata 
Sales Agreement,
[20]
 Charter Party,
[21]
 Additional Clauses to Charter Party,
[22]
 and in Gallardoâs letter of cancellation 
dated February 5, 1988.
[23]
 We note that 
the agreement was purportedly entered into in the presence of a certain Stanley 
Ho. Curiously though, petitioner ADR did not present Mr. Ho in court to 
corroborate its claim. Lastly, Exhibit 3, though captioned as an âagreement,â 
appears to be only a unilateral statement of Mar Gallardo, without the conforme 
of Stywood and ADR. 


It bears emphasizing also that if indeed the purpose of the February 11, 1988 
Charter Party between ADR and Stywood was to implement the aborted February 5, 
1988 Charter Party between ADR and Gallardo, why was the volume of the cargo 
reduced? The subject cargo in the earlier (Feb. 5) Charter Party was described 
as: 




6,500 CBM FALCATTA (minimum) 7,000 (maximum) at Ownerâs Option
[24]


The subject cargo in the later (Feb. 11) Charter Party was described to be: 





5,000 CBM FALCATTA (minimum) UP TO VESSEL MAXIMUM CAPACITY AT CHARTERERâS 
OPTION
[25]


The discrepancy creates serious doubt as to the veracity of petitionerâs 
assertion that the subject cargoes in the two contracts are one and the same. 
Rather, such discrepancy does not strengthen his credibility. 


Petitioner makes capital of the admission by respondent Gallardo that 
Stywood, as the buyer of the falcata logs, is the beneficiary of the charter 
agreement for the MV Pacific Breeze,
[26]
 
to boost its claim that Stywood and not Gallardo is the real party-in-interest. 
Petitionerâs inference is clearly 
non sequitur
. The Charter Party shows 
that there are only two parties to it, namely, petitioner ADR and respondent 
Gallardo, without any mention of Stywood as the third-party beneficiary. The 
fact that Stywood, as buyer of the falcata logs, stands to benefit from the 
Charter Party does not, by itself, vest Stywood with the personality to take 
over the charter agreement. That Stywood is a stranger to the Charter Party 
becomes clear in view of the consistent findings of both courts below that there 
is no evidence to support the claim concerning the alleged take-over agreement 
between Stywood and Gallardo. 


A final note. The CA took notice of the fact that Stywood chartered a 
different vessel,
[27]
 the MV Adhiguna 
Dharma, in its February 11, 1988 Charter Party with ADR. Assuming that the 
alleged agreement is authentic, 
Stywoodâs authority, as therein 
provided, is limited to the use of the Charter Vessel MV Pacific 
Breeze
. It is, therefore, beyond Stywoodâs authority to use a vessel 
other than the MV Pacific Breeze. Further, the ostensible agreement only 
empowers Stywood to 
take over the February 5, 1988 Charter Party and not 
to enter into a new one
. 


The ineluctable conclusion derived from these factual antecedents is that the 
February 11, 1988 Charter Party between Stywood and ADR and the February 5, 1988 
Charter Party between petitioner and respondent Gallardo are not in any way 
linked. To our mind, the alleged take over by Stywood was a mere rationalization 
if not a ruse used by petitioner to avoid refunding the P242,000 advanced by 
private respondent. 


Absent clear proof, other than the naked assertion of petitioner, that 
Gallardo authorized Stywood to take over its February 5, 1988 charter party with 
ADR, we need not tarry to delve into the issues as to who is the real 
party-in-interest in this case and whether or not there was novation of said 
charter party. Those issues are now academic. 


To summarize, we find that no reversible error was committed by the Court of 
Appeals. For failure of petitioner to perform its obligation on time, respondent 
Gallardo is entitled to cancel the Charter Party and to demand damages. This is 
pursuant to Article 1191 of the New Civil Code,
[28]
 which provides that the power to rescind 
obligations is implied in reciprocal ones in case one of the obligors should not 
comply with what is incumbent upon him, and the injured party may rescind the 
obligation, with payment of damages. As to actual damages, we agree with the 
trial courtâs decision that petitioner is entitled to recover the amount of 
P242,000 representing the advance freight to petitioner, as shown in the 
records.
[29]
 Because the amount due in 
this case arises from a contract of affreightment and not from a loan or 
forbearance of money, the legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum should be 
applied.
[30]


Finally, the complaint for damages was instituted by Gallardo on March 10, 
1988, following the unjustified refusal of ADR to settle his claim. Considering 
the fact that respondent was compelled to hire an attorney to protect and defend 
his interest, the award of attorneyâs fees to private respondent in the amount 
of P20,000 is justified.
[31]


WHEREFORE
, the petition is hereby 
DENIED
 
for lack of merit. The appealed decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV 
No. 47556 is AFFIRMED. Petitioner ADR Shipping Services, Inc. is hereby ordered 
to pay respondent Marcelino Gallardo P242,000.00 with interest at six percent 
(6%) per annum, from the date of filing the complaint until fully paid, plus 
P20,000.00 as attorneyâs fees. Costs against petitioner.
