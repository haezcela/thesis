RICARDO V. QUINTOS, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND JOSE T. VILLAROSA, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO, J.:


 
The Case
 
Before us is a petition for 
certiorari
 with prayer for the
issuance of a temporary restraining order and a writ of preliminary injunction
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.  Petitioner seeks to annul the Orders (âAssailed Ordersâ for brevity)
dated August 27, 2001 and September 12, 2001 of the Commission on Electionsâ
Second Division (âCOMELECâ for brevity) in Election Protest Case No. 2001-34
entitled â
Ricardo V. Quintos v. Jose T. Villarosa
.â  The Assailed Orders deferred the delivery to the COMELEC of the
protested and counter-protested ballot boxes (âContested Ballot Boxesâ for
brevity) from the Municipality of Paluan, Occidental Mindoro.  The same ballot boxes were also the subject
of two pending municipal election protests
[1]
 in
the Regional Trial Court of Mamburao, Branch 44, Occidental Mindoro.


The COMELEC, under the Assailed Orders, gave the Regional Trial
Court of Mamburao priority in the custody and revision of the ballots in the
Contested Ballot Boxes.  The Assailed
Orders deviated from the order of preference prescribed in Section 2 of COMELEC
Resolution No. 2812 promulgated on October 17, 1995.  Under this COMELEC Resolution, when contested ballot boxes are
the subject of simultaneous protests before the COMELEC and the Regional Trial
Court, the COMELEC enjoys preference in the custody of the ballot boxes.  Petitioner contends that in issuing the
Assailed Orders, the COMELEC acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or
with grave abuse of discretion, and there is no appeal or any speedy remedy in
the ordinary course of law.


Thus, this petition for 
certiorari
.


The Antecedents


Petitioner Ricardo V. Quintos (âpetitionerâ for brevity) and
private respondent Jose T. Villarosa (âprivate respondentâ for brevity) were
candidates for Governor of Occidental Mindoro in the May 14, 2001
elections.  On May 26, 2001, the
Provincial Board of Canvassers proclaimed private respondent winner with 57,136
votes. Petitioner received 56,043 votes and lost to private respondent by 1,093
votes.
[2]

Petitioner filed with the COMELEC an election protest, docketed as Election
Protest Case No. 2001-34,
[3]

against private respondent claiming that massive fraud and illegal electoral
practices were committed in the contested precincts (Precinct Nos. 13A and 14A,
Barangay Lumangbayan, Municipality of Paluan) during the registration, the
voting and the counting of the votes.  Petitioner claimed that because of the fraud and illegal electoral
practices, he was deprived of votes cast in his favor while private respondent
was illegally benefited by votes which should not be credited to him.  After revision of the ballots in the
protested precincts, petitioner prayed that he be declared the winner in the
elections and thus be proclaimed as the duly elected Governor of the Province
of Occidental Mindoro.


On June 15, 2001, private respondent filed his Answer with Counter-Protest
and Counterclaim.
[4]

He counter-protested thirteen (13) ballot boxes from 13 precincts in the
Municipality of Paluan, namely, Precinct Nos. 23A, 25A, 24A, 3A, 47A1/48A,
29A/30A, 35A, 27A/28A, 7A/8A, 26A1, 9A, 36A and 47A.


In a hearing on August 7, 2001, private respondentâs counsel
moved that the Regional Trial Court of Mamburao be allowed to take first
custody of the Contested Ballot Boxes before their transmittal to the
COMELEC.  The Contested Ballot Boxes
were also the subject of two election protests, pending before the Regional
Trial Court of Mamburao, involving the positions of mayor and councilors in the
Municipality of Mamburao.
[5]
 The
COMELEC issued an Order dated August 7, 2001 denying private respondentâs
motion because of COMELEC Resolution No. 2812 giving the COMELEC preference in
the custody of the Contested Ballot Boxes over the Regional Trial Court.
[6]


From the COMELECâs Order, private respondent filed a
Manifestation and Motion for Partial Reconsideration.
[7]

Private respondent stated that petitioner identified only one (1) ballot box
(Barangay Lumangbayan, Precinct No. 13A/14A [clustered]) in the Municipality of
Paluan, Occidental Mindoro as subject of his protest.  Private respondent, however, identified thirteen (13) ballot
boxes from the same municipality in his counter-protest. Thus, the total number
of Contested Ballot Boxes, both in the protest and counter-protest, is fourteen
(14). Private respondent explained that the Contested Ballot Boxes were also
the subject of two municipal election protests both filed with the Regional
Trial Court of Mamburao, and both handled by counsel of private
respondent.  In an Order dated June 25,
2001,
[8]

the Regional Trial Court directed the Municipal Treasurer of Paluan to bring
before the court the Contested Ballot Boxes.


Private respondent averred that if COMELEC Resolution No. 2812
were strictly implemented, the resolution of the election protests in the
Municipality of Paluan would suffer undue delay. The COMELEC would take first
custody of the 14 Contested Ballot Boxes.  The resolution of the election protests in the Municipality of Paluan
would have to wait for the COMELEC to complete its revision of the ballots in
the Contested Ballot Boxes.  Private
respondent argued that if the COMELEC reconsidered its Order dated August 7,
2001, the local election protests would be resolved expeditiously without
causing any undue delay in the resolution of petitionerâs election protest and
private respondentâs counter-protest.


Private respondent prayed that the COMELEC allow the one ballot
box (Precinct Nos. 13A/14A, Barangay Lumangbayan) from the Municipality of
Paluan, subject of petitionerâs protest, to be delivered first to the Regional
Trial Court of Mamburao.  The Regional
Trial Court could transmit this one ballot box to the COMELEC after the
revision of the ballots in the election protests pending with the trial
court.  Alternatively, private
respondent prayed that the COMELEC first allow the delivery of the 13 ballot
boxes subject of the counter-protest to the Regional Trial Court of Mamburao.


On August 27, 2001, the COMELEC rendered the Assailed Order
granting private respondentâs Manifestation and Motion for Partial
Reconsideration subject to the following guidelines:


â
Accordingly
, the
retrieval of the ballot box from Precinct No. 13A/14A of Barangay Lumangbayan,
and those from the precincts mentioned in the aforequoted manifestation, all
from the Municipality of Paluan, Occidental Mindoro, is hereby ordered deferred
subject to the following guidelines:


That the said
ballot boxes should be delivered to the Commission (Second Division) one (1)
week prior to the termination of the revision of the other protested ballot
boxes, the schedule of which shall be set after the delivery of the said ballot
boxes; and
 
The Regional
Trial Court of Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro, Branch 44, is requested to conduct
the revision and appreciation proceedings in Election Cases Nos. 19 and 20
(
Ocampo vs. Pangilinan
 and 
Terana vs. Velandria
, respectively) in the most
expeditious manner possible in order that the subject ballot boxes and other
election documents can be turned over to the Commission in due time.  No revision of ballots shall be conducted
without prior notice being given to both parties in the above-entitled case.


SO ORDERED
.â
[9]


On September 4, 2001, petitioner filed a Motion for
Reconsideration
[10]

of the Order of the COMELEC dated August 27, 2001.


On September 12, 2001, the COMELEC issued the second Assailed
Order,
[11]

the dispositive portion of which reads:


â
Wherefore
, in view of
the foregoing, the Commission (Second Division) hereby 
DENIES
 the instant 
Motion for
Reconsideration
. It is however, emphasized that one (1) week prior to the
completion of the revision of the protested ballots, the Regional Trial Court,
Branch 44, of Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro shall be notified to transmit the
ballot box of Precinct 13A/14A to this Commission whether or not the said court
has completed its revision of the ballots therein.


SO ORDERED
.â


Hence, petitioner filed this petition for 
certiorari

seeking the annulment of the Assailed Orders dated August 27, 2001 and
September 12, 2001 based on the following grounds:


â1.  The Manifestation and
Motion for Partial Reconsideration is not verified pursuant to Sec. 3, Rule 19,
Comelec Rules of Procedure and is considered an unsigned pleading which should
be denied (
Soller vs. Comelec, et al.
, G.R. No. 139853, September 5, 2000;

Lalic vs. Casupanan
, EAC No. 73-98, January 12, 2001, G.R. No. 146868, February
27, 2001).


2.  The Order of August 27,
2001 was issued without giving the petitioner and other parties concerned the
opportunity to comment/oppose the motion for partial reconsideration filed by
the respondent in violation of due process.


3.  The Order of August 27,
2001 is impractical and would clog one ballot with 26 different exhibit marks
as there are four (4) parties in Election Protest Case No. 19, RTC, Branch 44,
Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro involving the Office of Mayor of Paluan,
Occidental Mindoro as well as twenty-two (22) parties in Election Protest Case
No. 20, RTC, Branch 44, Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro, involving the Office of
Municipal Councilors of Paluan, Occidental Mindoro.


4.  There is no compelling
and urgent reason to disturb the order of preferences in the custody and revision
of ballots and other election documents contained in the ballot boxes
sequentially enumerated in Section 2 of Comelec Resolution No. 2812 promulgated
October 17, 1995 and still enforced up to the present time.â
[12]


In his Comment and Manifestation,
[13]
 private
respondent manifested that the Regional Trial Court of Mamburao had completed
the revision of the ballots in the ballot box of Precincts 13A and 14A of
Barangay Lumangbayan, Paluan. Private respondent submitted the supporting
Certification
[14]

dated November 19, 2001 issued by the Clerk of Court of the trial court.  Private respondent stated that the Assailed
Orders of the COMELEC, which petitioner sought to restrain, were already
implemented.  The COMELEC could direct
at any time the Regional Trial Court to transmit to the COMELEC in Manila the
ballot box of Precincts 13A and 14A of Barangay Lumangbayan.  Private respondent thus asserted that this
development rendered the instant petition for 
certiorari
, with prayer
for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, moot and
academic.


In its Comment,
[15]
 the
Office of the Solicitor General, as counsel for the COMELEC, stated that the
issue is already moot and academic because the trial court had completed its
review of the ballot boxes included in petitionerâs protest.  These ballot boxes are ready for transmittal
to the COMELEC.


In his Reply, petitioner stated that while he concedes that
indeed the Regional Trial Court had completed its review of the ballots subject
of his protest, still the issue should not be considered moot and
academic.  Petitioner asserts that it is
of paramount interest that the COMELEC strictly observe the order of preference
in the custody and revision of ballots as prescribed by Section 2 of COMELEC
Resolution No. 2812.


The Issues


This petition raises the following issues:


1.  Whether the COMELEC, in
issuing the Assailed Orders giving the Regional Trial Court of Mamburao
priority in the custody and revision of the ballots in the Contested Ballot
Boxes, acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion because (a) there was no compelling reason to disturb the order of
preference prescribed in Section 2 of COMELEC Resolution No. 2812; and (b) the
Order dated August 27, 2001 is impractical.


2. Whether the Unverified Manifestation and Motion for Partial
Reconsideration should have been denied.


3.  Whether the failure to
give petitioner the opportunity to comment or oppose private respondentâs
Manifestation and Motion for Partial Reconsideration is a denial of due
process.


Since the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Mamburao
certified on November 19, 2001 that âthe revision/counting of ballot boxes of
Precincts 13A and 14A of Barangay Lumangbayan, Paluan, Occidental Mindoro has
already been completed,â
[16]
 the
issue is moot and academic with respect to the ballot box subject of
petitionerâs protest.  There is no
showing, however, that the revision of ballots in the 13 ballot boxes of the 13
precincts in the Municipality of Paluan, which are the subject of the
counter-protest, was also completed.  Hence, the issue is not moot and academic with regard to the 13
counter-protested ballot boxes, the initial custody of which was also given to
the Regional Trial Court of Mamburao in the Assailed Orders of the COMELEC.


The Courtâs Ruling


We rule that the COMELEC did not act without or in excess of
jurisdiction, or commit grave abuse of discretion, in issuing the Assailed
Orders giving the Regional Trial Court of Mamburao first access to the
Contested Ballot Boxes.


First
Issue:  (a) whether there is no
compelling reason to disturb
the order of preference in COMELEC
Resolution No. 2812.


Petitioner contends that there is no compelling and urgent reason
to disturb the order of preference in the custody of the Contested Ballot
Boxes, which order is prescribed sequentially in Section 2 of COMELEC
Resolution No. 2812.  Petitioner alleges
that private respondentâs only reason in asking for observance of the order of
preference is to delay the election protest.  Petitioner points out that when the COMELEC promulgated Resolution No.
2812, the Electoral Tribunals and the COMELEC knew that delays would happen as
a matter of course in the observance of the order of preference.  Petitioner asserts that the rationale in the
order of preference prescribed in COMELEC Resolution No. 2812 is the importance
of the office involved insofar as the revision of the ballots is
concerned.  Petitioner maintains that if
the ballots and other election documents in the Contested Ballot Boxes are
initially placed in the custody of the COMELEC, the possibility of tampering of
these ballots and documents is very remote, if not impossible.


COMELEC Resolution No. 2812 addresses âthe matter of impounding,
transfer and control of ballot boxes, election documents and paraphernalia
which are subject of simultaneous protests before the Electoral Tribunals, the
Commission and Regional Trial Courts.â Section 2 of the Resolution provides as
follows:


âSec. 2.  The following order of preference in the custody and revision of ballots
and other documents contained in the ballot boxes shall be:


2.1 Presidential
Electoral Tribunal (PET);


2.2 Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET);


2.3 House of Representatives Electoral
Tribunal (HRET);


2.4 Commission on Elections (Commission);


2.5 Regional Trial Court (RTC).â


In its Assailed Order dated September 12, 2001, the COMELEC
explained the reason why it gave the Regional Trial Court of Mamburao, priority
in the custody of the Contested Ballot Boxes, thus:


âAfter due deliberation, the Commission (Second Division) finds
that no substantial right of protestant was violated by the issuance of the
said assailed Order.


It should bear emphasis that in the resolution of electoral protest
cases, the paramount consideration taken into account by this Commission is the
orderly, efficient and effective ascertainment of the will of the people 
vis a vis
 the rights of parties to a
speedy determination of their respective interests.  In granting the motion of protestee to allow the Regional Trial
Court of Mamburao to first take custody of the ballot box of Precinct No.
13A/14A subject of herein protest together with the counter-protested
ballot-boxes, all from the Municipality of Paluan, Occidental Mindoro, the
Commission (Second Division) sought to give the parties therein immediate
relief rather than have them unreasonably wait until the instant protest case
involving the whole Province of Occidental Mindoro be resolved to their
detriment.  This was likewise intended
to avoid the protested ballots being transported back and forth from Paluan to
Comelec, Manila then back again to Paluan or Mamburao.  One thing more, in the questioned Order,
this Division did not altogether vacate the protestantâs right over the subject
ballot box involved in his protest considering that the privilege given to the
lower court to take first custody of the said ballot box is limited only to
that period when the other protested ballot boxes are being revised by the
Commission.  In this connection, a
request was made to the RTC for it to expedite its revision of the said ballots
and to deliver the same to the Commission 
â...one
(1) week prior to the termination of the revision of the other protested ballot
boxesâ
 upon prior notice by this Division.â
[17]


The privilege given to the Regional Trial
Court to take first custody of the Contested Ballot Boxes is limited only to
the period when the other protested ballot boxes are being revised by the
COMELEC.  The COMELEC clarified that
this limitation applies not only to the ballot box subject of petitionerâs
protest, but also to the 13 ballot boxes subject of private respondentâs
counter-protest.  Thus, in its Assailed
Order dated August 27, 2001, the COMELEC deferred the retrieval of âthe ballot
box from Precinct No. 13A/14A of Barangay Lumangbayan, and those from the
precincts mentioned in the aforequoted manifestation
[18]

(referring to the 13 counter-protested ballot boxes), all from the Municipality
of Paluan, Occidental Mindoro.â


The COMELEC further issued the guideline that âsaid ballot boxes
should be delivered to the Commission (Second Division) one (1) week prior to
the termination of the revision of the other protested ballot boxes, the
schedule of which shall be set after the delivery of the said ballot boxes x x
x.â The COMELEC even emphasized that âone (1) week prior to the completion of
the revision of the protested ballots, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 44, of
Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro shall be notified to transmit the ballot box of
Precinct 13A/14A to this Commission 
whether
or not the said court has completed its revision of the ballots therein
.â
[19]

In the same manner, the COMELEC directed the delivery of the 13
counter-protested ballot boxes whether or not the Regional Trial Court has
completed its revision of the ballots in these ballot boxes.


Admittedly, the COMELEC enjoys preference over the Regional Trial
Court of Mamburao in the custody and revision of the ballots in the Contested
Ballot Boxes.  However, the COMELEC may
for good reason waive this preference and allow the Regional Trial Court first
access to the Contested Ballot Boxes.  The COMELEC allowed the Regional Trial Court to have first access to the
Contested Ballot Boxes âto give the parties therein immediate relief rather
than have them unreasonably wait until the instant protest case (Election
Protest Case No. 2001-34) involving the whole Province of Occidental Mindoro be
resolved to their detriment.â Another reason was âto avoid the protested
ballots being transported back and forth from Paluan to Comelec, Manila then
back again to Paluan or Mamburao.â


The COMELEC insured that this arrangement did not prejudice
petitionerâs right to a speedy resolution of his election protest.  The COMELEC limited the privilege given to
the Regional Trial Court only to the period when the COMELEC was still revising
other protested ballot boxes.  The
COMELEC requested the Regional Trial Court to expedite its revision of the
ballots and to deliver the Contested Ballot Boxes to the COMELEC one week prior
to the COMELECâs termination of the revision of other protested ballot
boxes.  Such an arrangement is deemed
covered under Section 3 of COMELEC Resolution No. 2812 which provides:


âSec. 3.  The Tribunals, the
Commission and the Courts shall coordinate and make arrangement with each other
so as not to delay or interrupt the revision of ballots being conducted.  The synchronization of revision of ballots
shall be such that the expeditious disposition of the respective protest cases
shall be the primary concern.â


The order of preference in Section 2 of
COMELEC Resolution No. 2812 may therefore yield to the primary concern for the
expeditious disposition of protest cases. Instead of leaving the Contested
Ballot Boxes unutilized during the time the COMELEC would be revising other protested
ballot boxes, the COMELEC allowed the Regional Trial Court to have access to
the Contested Ballot Boxes.  This would
prevent delay in the disposition of the two municipal election cases pending
before the trial court.  Election
contests involve the public interest,
[20]
 and
should be decided expeditiously and economically without unnecessary delays.
[21]


First
Issue: (b) whether the Assailed Order
of August 27, 2001 is impractical.


Petitioner also contends that the Assailed Order of August 27,
2001 is impractical.  The Assailed Order
will clutter one ballot with 26 different exhibit marks since there are
twenty-six parties in the two municipal election cases pending before the
Regional Trial Court of Mamburao.


We are not persuaded.  The
COMELEC has shown the practicality of its Assailed Order dated August 27,
2001.  First, in giving the Regional
Trial Court first access to the Contested Ballot Boxes while the COMELEC is
still revising other protested ballot boxes, delay is prevented in the
resolution of the protest cases before the trial court.  Second, the Contested Ballot Boxes will be
transported only once from the Regional Trial Court of Mamburao in Occidental
Mindoro to the COMELEC in Manila.  Petitioner fears that the 26 parties in the two municipal election cases
before the Regional Trial Court will clutter the ballots with 26 different
exhibit marks.  If the parties wish to
have the ballots marked as their exhibits, that is their right regardless of
who takes first custody of the ballots.  These markings, however, are not expected to prevent a proper review of
the ballots in the petitionerâs protest case before the COMELEC.


Second
Issue: whether the unverified Manifestation and Motion
for Partial Reconsideration should
have been denied outright.


Petitioner contends that since private respondent failed to
verify the Manifestation and Motion for Partial Reconsideration as required by
the COMELEC Rules of Procedure,
[22]
 the
same is an unsigned pleading, and should have been denied outright.


We agree with the Solicitor General that the alleged lack of
verification of private respondentâs Manifestation and Motion for Partial
Reconsideration is merely a technicality that should not defeat the will of the
electorate.  The COMELEC may liberally
construe
[23]

or even suspend
[24]

its rules of procedure in the interest of justice, including obtaining a speedy
disposition of all matters pending before the COMELEC.


Third
Issue: whether the failure to require comment
or opposition to
the Manifestation and Motion for
Partial Reconsideration is a
denial of due process.


Petitioner contends that the COMELEC issued the Assailed Order of
August 27, 2001 without giving him the opportunity to comment or oppose the
motion for partial reconsideration.  This, bewails petitioner, violates his right to due process.


The Solicitor General correctly stated that there was no denial
of due process since petitioner subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration
which the COMELEC considered and acted on, albeit unfavorably, in the Order
dated September 12, 2001.  The essence
of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard, or as applied to
administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain oneâs side or an
opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the assailed action or ruling.
[25]

Petitioner cannot successfully invoke deprivation of due process since the
COMELEC gave petitioner the chance to be heard in his motion for
reconsideration.
[26]


The COMELEC, in issuing the Assailed Orders allowing the Regional
Trial Court to take prior custody of the Contested Ballot Boxes, did not act
without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion. In 
Sahali v. Commission on Elections
,
[27]

this Court held:


â
Certiorari
 as a special civil action can be availed of only if
there is concurrence of the essential requisites, to wit: (a) a tribunal, board
or officer exercising judicial functions has acted without or in excess of
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess
of jurisdiction, and (b) there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law for the purpose of annulling or modifying
the proceeding.  There must be a
capricious, arbitrary and whimsical exercise of power for it to prosper.


To question the jurisdiction of the lower court or the agency
exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions, the remedy is a special civil
action for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.  The petitioner in such cases must clearly
show that the public respondent acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.  Grave abuse of discretion defies exact
definition, but generally refers to âcapricious or whimsical exercise of
judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.  The abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to
an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by
law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised
in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.


It has been held, however, that no grave abuse of discretion may be
attributed to a court simply because of its alleged misappreciation of facts
and evidence.  A writ of 
certiorari
 may
not be used to correct a lower tribunalâs evaluation of the evidence and
factual findings.  In other words, it is
not a remedy for mere errors of judgment, which are correctible by an appeal or
a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.


In fine, 
certiorari
 will issue only to correct errors of
jurisdiction, not errors of procedure or mistakes in the findings or
conclusions of the lower court.  As long
as a court acts within its jurisdiction, any alleged errors committed in the
exercise of its discretion will amount to nothing more than errors of judgment
which are reviewable by timely appeal and not by special civil action for

certiorari
.â


In the instant case, the COMELEC has original jurisdiction over
the election protest of petitioner who sought to be proclaimed as the duly
elected Governor of the Province of Occidental Mindoro.  Under Article IX-C, Section 2, paragraph 2
of the Constitution, the COMELEC exercises âexclusive original jurisdiction
over all contests relating to the elections x x x of all elective, provincial,
and city officials x x x.â Since the COMELEC has jurisdiction over petitionerâs
election protest, it had the authority to issue the Assailed Orders.


Moreover, the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in
issuing the Assailed Orders since these orders are not tainted with a
capricious, arbitrary or whimsical exercise of power.  In giving the Regional Trial Court first access to the Contested
Ballot Boxes, the COMELEC sought to prevent delay in the resolution of the two
protest cases pending before the trial court.  However, first access by the Regional Trial Court is only limited to the
period of time when the COMELEC is still revising other protested ballot
boxes.  The primary concern for such
arrangement is the expeditious disposition of protest cases, which is
underscored in Section 3 of COMELEC Resolution No. 2812.


WHEREFORE
, the petition for 
certiorari
 is
