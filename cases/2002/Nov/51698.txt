QUISUMBING, J.:


This petition for review assails the decision
[1]

dated February 12, 1999 and the resolution
[2]

dated December 29, 1999, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 47799.  They affirmed the judgment dated September
22, 1993 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 21 of Malolos, Bulacan, in Civil
Case No. 8250-M, which (a) dismissed the complaint against spouses Manuel and
Erlinda Dy Tang, (b) declared the Sheriffâs Certificate of Sale to them, as
well as the Deed of Sale and Transfer by them in favor of intervenor-respondent
Arturo Tantoco, valid and effective, and (c) ordered the Viray spouses to pay
petitioner Marcelo
[3]

Centeno, substituted by his heir Corazon Centeno Reyes, 
P
66,000 as the
value of the land subject of this case.


The facts, as found by
both the trial and the appellate courts are as follows:


Spouses Marcelo and Pacita Centeno were the registered owners of
a parcel of agricultural land consisting of 31,697 square meters, covered by
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 57474, in Barrio Kinamatayang Kabayo, San
Miguel, Bulacan.  Their niece, Elizabeth
Centeno Viray, somehow stole said TCT and forged the Centenosâ signature in a Special
Power of Attorney, enabling Elizabeth to mortgage the property to Manuel Dy
Tang as security for her loan of 
P
55,000 from him. In support of the
mortgage, Elizabeth executed a Real Estate Mortgage, a promissory note, as well
as an affidavit of non-tenancy over the subject property.


As Elizabeth failed to redeem the property, Dy Tang in a written
request, asked the concerned Sheriff to extrajudicially foreclose the mortgage.
Marcelo Centeno was furnished a copy of the request. Hearing no opposition from
Marcelo, the Sheriff proceeded with the public auction where Dy Tang was the
highest bidder. Consequently, a Certificate of Sale was executed in Dy Tangâs
favor. Dy Tang in turn executed a Deed of Assignment and Transfer in favor of
intervenor-respondent Tantoco.


During the pendency of the one
year redemption period, Marcelo Centeno filed a complaint for declaration of
nullity of documents and for recovery of ownership of the subject land with the
RTC of Malolos, Bulacan.  It was
docketed as Civil Case No. 8250-M. Meantime, neither Marcelo nor
Elizabeth timely redeemed the property from Tantoco.  Hence, Tantoco consolidated the title over the property in his
name.


On September 22, 1993, the RTC of Malolos issued its decision,
thus:


WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the Intervenor
Arturo Tantoco and the defendant spouses Manuel and Erlinda Dy Tang and against
the plaintiff (substituted by the heirs) as follows:


(a) Dismissing the complaint insofar as the defendants spouses
Manuel and Erlinda Dy Tang are concerned;


(b)  Declaring the
Certificate of Sale dated November 20, 1985 as valid and effective;


(c)  Declaring the Deed of
Sale and Transfer dated February 5, 1985  as valid and effective;


(d) Ordering the cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No.
T-57474 issued by the Registry of Deeds for the Province of Bulacan and the
issuance in its stead of another Transfer Certificate of Title (over the same
parcel of land) in the name of Arturo Tantoco;


(e) Ordering the plaintiff (substituted by his heir Corazon
Centeno) and/or those acting in his behalf or stead, particularly Urbano Reyes
and Edgardo âTotoyâ Azonsa who are tilling and/or supervising its tilling to
surrender the harvest or to pay jointly and severally to Intervenor Arturo
Tantoco, the money value thereof;


(f) Ordering the plaintiff (substituted by his heir Corazon
Centeno) to pay 
P
5,000.00 attorneyâs fee to the Intervenor Arturo Tantoco;


(g) Dismissing the counterclaim and crossclaim of the defendants
Manuel and Erlinda Dy Tang for insufficiency of evidence;


(h) Ordering the defendants spouses Reynaldo and Elizabeth Viray to
pay the plaintiff the money value of the land in the amount of 
P
66,000.00 which
is the consideration stated in the Deed of Assignment and Transfer (Exhibit
âLâ).


With costs against the defendants spouses Reynaldo and Elizabeth C.
Viray.


SO ORDERED.
[4]


Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals which, on February
12, 1999, affirmed the decision of the Regional Trial Court, as follows:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision, dated September 22,
1993, of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 21) in Malolos, Bulacan in Civil Case
No. 8250-m is hereby AFFIRMED, with costs against the plaintiff-appellant.


SO ORDERED.
[5]


According to the Court of Appeals, a purchaser in good faith and
for value is one who buys the property of another, without notice that some
other person has a right to, or interest in such property and pays a full and
fair price for the same at the time of such purchase, or before he has notice
of the claims or interest of some other person in the property.  Using this definition, the Court of Appeals
declared that Dy Tang and Tantoco became the owner of the property in good
faith, since they bought the subject property free from any lien or encumbrance
or any notice of adverse claim. When Dy Tang agreed to the mortgage by
Elizabeth, the former did not know of the defect in the Special Power of
Attorney which the latter presented. Also, during the foreclosure of the
mortgage, no opposition was heard from the registered owner of the land,
despite prior notice. Thus, when Dy Tang purchased the property as the highest
bidder in the public auction, he obtained title over it in good faith. Dy Tang,
in turn, transferred said title to Tantoco who purchased the property and who,
upon the lapse of one year period without the concerned persons redeeming it,
consolidated the title in his name.


The Court of Appeals further said that it was Marcelo Centenoâs
negligence which caused the transfer to Tantoco, hence Marcelo should bear the
consequences, and not Tantoco. Finally, the appellate court held that Tantoco
was not divested of his right over the property when he assigned his right over
the same to Jose Baltazar. This was so because the assignment was a mere
equitable mortgage in which Tantoco reserved a right to repurchase the
property.


Petitioner moved for a reconsideration but it was denied. Hence,
this petition averring that the Court of Appeals erred in:


I. ...NOT DECLARING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT-INTERVENOR ARTURO
TANTOCO CANNOT SEEK PROTECTION AS A âBUYER IN GOOD FAITHâ WHEN HE PURCHASED THE
SUBJECT REAL PROPERTY NOT FROM THE REGISTERED OWNER (PLAINTIFF MARCELO
CENTENO) WHO, TO DATE, HAS REMAINED THE REGISTERED OWNER THEREOF.


II. ...NOT DECLARING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT-INTERVENOR ARTURO
TANTOCO CANNOT INVOKE BEING A âBUYER IN GOOD FAITHâ WHEN HE PURCHASED THE
SUBJECT REAL PROPERTY ON FEBRUARY 5, 1985 OR EVEN PRIOR TO THE START OF THE
1-YEAR REDEMPTION PERIOD FROM THE REGISTRATION OF THE CERTIFICATE OF SALE ON
FEBRUARY 13, 1985.


III. ...NOT FINDING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT-INTERVENOR ARTURO
TANTOCO IS DIVESTED OF HIS RIGHT, IF ANY, OVER THE SUBJECT PROPERTY WHEN HE
AGAIN ASSIGNED IN HASTE THE SAME TO JOSE BALTAZAR WHILE THE TITLE THEREOF WAS
UNDER PLAINTIFF MARCELO CENTENO AND REMAINS SO UP TO THE PRESENT.


IV. ...NOT RESOLVING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT-INTERVENOR ARTURO
TANTOCO COULD NOT HAVE A BETTER RIGHT THAN HIS PREDECESSOR, DEFENDANT MANUEL DY
TANG, WHO ALSO FALSELY CLAIMS TO BE A âBUYER IN GOOD FAITHâ BUT, LIKE DEFENDANT
ELIZABETH VIRAY, DID NOT ADDUCE ANY EVIDENCE IN COURT AGAINST THE ASSERTION AND
DECLARATION OF PLAINTIFF MARCELO CENTENO THAT THEY, DEFENDANTS ELIZABETH VIRAY
AND MANUEL DY TANG, CONNIVED WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE FALSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS.


V. ...NOT DECLARING THE NULLITY OF THE QUESTIONED SPECIAL POWER OF
ATTORNEY, DEED OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE, PROMISSORY NOTE ALL DATED JANUARY 24,
1984, THE ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER BY DEFENDANT MANUEL DY TANG IN FAVOR OF
PRIVATE RESPONDENT-INTERVENOR ARTURO TANTOCO AND THE LATTERâS ASSIGNMENT IN
FAVOR OF JOSE BALTAZAR.
[6]


In sum the issues for our consideration are:


1) Is intervenor-respondent Tantoco a
buyer in good faith and for value?


2) Has Tantoco divested his rights over
the subject property?


3) Did the Court of
Appeals err in not declaring the nullity of the documents which ultimately
transferred the subject land to Jose Baltazar?


At the outset, we note that the first two issues are factual. It
is a basic rule that factual issues are beyond the province of this Court in a
petition for review, for it is not the Courtâs function to weigh the evidence
all over again.
[7]

There are exceptions to this general rule, but petitioner did not show that
this case is one of them.
[8]

Factual findings of the trial courts, when adopted and confirmed by the Court
of Appeals, are binding and conclusive upon us and, generally, will not be
reviewed on appeal.
[9]


As to the third issue,
Tantocoâs status as purchaser in good faith is settled.  It is immaterial to determine whether the
Special Power of Attorney, as well as the other documents instrumental to the
transfer of the property from petitioner to Dy Tang and Tantoco, was invalid,
because it will not cause the reversion of the property to petitioner. Nor can
we disregard Tantocoâs right over the property as its purchaser in good faith
and for value.
[10]
 Thus, we are constrained to affirm the decision
of the Court of Appeals which, as earlier stated, had sustained the judgment of
the trial court.


WHEREFORE
, the instant
petition is 
DENIED
. The
assailed decision of the Court of Appeals dated February 12, 1999 in CA-G.R. CV
No. 47799, and its resolution dated December 29, 1999, are 
AFFIRMED
.


Costs against petitioner.
