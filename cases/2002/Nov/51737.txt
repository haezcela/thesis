PUNO, J.:


 This petition seeks to set aside the Decision dated March 13, 2000 
and Resolution dated February 13, 2001 of the Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. SP No. 53204 entitled â
Cottonway Marketing Corp. vs. National 
Labor Relations Commission, et al
.â 
The facts are as follows: 




Petitioners were former employees of Cottonway Marketing Corp. 
(Cottonway), hired as promo girls for their garment products. In 
October, 1994, after their services were terminated as the company was 
allegedly suffering business losses, petitioners filed with the National
 Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) a complaint for illegal dismissal, 
underpayment of salary, and non-payment of premium pay for rest day, 
service incentive leave pay and thirteenth month pay against Cottonway 
Marketing Corp. and Network Fashion Inc./JCT International Trading.
[1]




    On December 19, 1995, Labor Arbiter Romulus S. Protasio issued a
 Decision finding petitioners' retrenchment valid and ordering Cottonway
 to pay petitioners' separation pay and their proportionate thirteenth 
month pay.
[2]
 


On appeal, the NLRC, in its Decision dated March 26, 1996, reversed
 the Decision of the Labor Arbiter and ordered the reinstatement of 
petitioners without loss of seniority rights and other privileges. It 
also ordered Cottonway to pay petitioners their proportionate thirteenth
 month pay and their full backwages inclusive of allowances and other 
benefits, or their monetary equivalent computed from the time their 
salaries were withheld from them up to the date of their actual 
reinstatement.
[3]
 


Cottonway filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by the Commission in a Resolution dated July 31, 1996.
[4]
 


On August 30, 1996, Cottonway filed with the NLRC a manifestation 
stating that they have complied with the order of reinstatement by 
sending notices dated June 5, 1996 requiring the petitioners to return 
to work, but to no avail; and consequently, they sent letters to 
petitioners dated August 1, 1996 informing them that they have lost 
their employment for failure to comply with the return to work order.
[5]
 Cottonway also filed a petition for 
certiorari
 with the Supreme Court which was dismissed on October 14, 1996.
[6]
 


On November 6, 1997, petitioners filed with the NLRC a motion for 
execution of its Decision on the ground that it had become final and 
executory.
[7]


On December 4, 1996, the Research and Investigation Unit of the NLRC
 issued a computation of the monetary award in accordance with the March
 26 Decision of the NLRC.
[8]


Meanwhile, Cottonway filed a motion for reconsideration of the 
Supreme Court Resolution of October 14, 1996 dismissing the petition for
 
certiorari
. The motion for reconsideration was denied with finality on 
January 13, 1997.
[9]
 


On March 4, 1997, Cottonway filed a manifestation with the NLRC 
reiterating their allegations in their manifestation dated August 30, 
1996, and further alleging that petitioners have already found 
employment elsewhere.
[10]
 


On March 13, 1997, the Research and Investigation Unit of the NLRC 
issued an additional computation of petitioners' monetary award in 
accordance with the March 26 NLRC decision.
[11]
 


On the same date, Cottonway filed with the NLRC a supplemental 
manifestation praying that the Commission allow the reception of 
evidence with respect to their claim that petitioners have found new 
employment. The Commission denied Cottonwayâs prayer in an Order dated 
March 24, 1997
[12]
 and Resolution dated July 24, 1997.
[13]
 


Nonetheless, on April 8, 1998, Labor Arbiter Romulus S. Protasio 
issued an Order declaring that the award of backwages and proportionate 
thirteenth month pay to petitioners should be limited from the time of 
their illegal dismissal up to the time they received the notice of 
termination sent by the company upon their refusal to report for work 
despite the order of reinstatement. He cited the fact that petitioners 
failed to report to their posts without justifiable reason despite 
respondent's order requiring them to return to work immediately. The 
Labor Arbiter ordered the Research and Investigation Unit to recompute 
the monetary award in accordance with its ruling.
[14]
 


The April 8 Order of the Labor Arbiter, however, was set aside by 
the Commission in its Resolution dated September 21, 1998. The 
Commission ruled that its Decision dated March 26, 1996 has become final
 and executory and it is the ministerial duty of the Labor Arbiter to 
issue the corresponding writ of execution to effect full and unqualified
 implementation of said decision.
[15]

 The Commission thus ordered that the records of the case be remanded to
 the Labor Arbiter for execution. Cottonway moved for reconsideration of
 said resolution, to no avail. 


Hence, Cottonway filed a petition for 
certiorari
 with the Court of 
Appeals seeking the reversal of the ruling of the NLRC and the 
reinstatement of the Order dated April 8, 1998 issued by Labor Arbiter 
Romulus S. Protasio. 


The appellate court granted the petition in its Decision dated March 13, 2000.
[16]

 It ruled that petitioners' reinstatement was no longer possible as they
 deliberately refused to return to work despite the notice given by 
Cottonway. The Court of Appeals thus held that the amount of backwages 
due them should be computed only up to the time they received their 
notice of termination. It said: 


âPetitioner's termination of private respondents' employment by 
reason of their failure to report for work despite due notice being 
valid, it would change the substance of the questioned March 26, 1996 
decision which awards backwages to the complainants up to their 
reinstatement. Again, private respondents' reinstatement is no longer 
possible because of the supervening event which is their valid 
termination. The deliberate failure to report for work after notice to 
return bars reinstatement. It would be unjust and inequitable then to 
require petitioner to pay private respondents their backwages even after
 the latter were validly terminated when in fact petitioner dutifully 
complied with the reinstatement aspect of the decision. Thus, the period
 within which the monetary award of private respondents should be based 
is limited up to the time of private respondents' receipt of the 
respective notices of termination on August 27, 1998.â
[17]
 


The Court of Appeals denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration in a Resolution issued on February 13, 2001.
[18]
 


Petitioners now question the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals. They impute the following errors: 


âI.  That the Honorable Court of Appeals gravely abused its 
discretion amounting to lack of and/or in excess of jurisdiction in 
rendering the assailed decision in CA-G.R. No. SP 53204 without first 
performing its ministerial duty of taking initial judicial action 
thereon unlawfully depriving the petitioners the opportunity to comment 
and/or file responsive pleadings to the petition resulting to their 
being unlawfully denied a day in court; 


II.  That the Honorable Court of Appeals gravely abused its 
discretion amounting to lack of and/or in excess of jurisdiction in 
rendering a decision in CA-G.R. No. SP 53204 reversing and setting aside
 the lawful and appropriate September 21, 1998 and March 31, 1999 
resolutions of the Honorable NLRC and reinstating the irregular and 
illegal April 8, 1998 Order of Honorable Arbiter Romulus Protasio; and 


III.  That the Honorable Court of Appeals gravely abused its 
discretion amounting to lack of and/or in excess of jurisdiction in 
issuing the February 13, 2001 Resolution which denied petitioners' 
motion for reconsideration from the decision of March 13, 2000 without 
stating the legal basis therefor.â
[19]
 


We proceed directly to the central issue in this case which is the 
computation of petitioners' backwagesâwhether it should be limited from 
the time they were illegally dismissed until they received the notice of
 termination sent by Cottonway on August 1, 1996 as argued by respondent
 company, or whether it should be computed from the time of their 
illegal dismissal until their actual reinstatement as argued by the 
petitioners. 


We agree with the petitioners. 


The issue of the legality of the termination of petitionersâ 
services has been settled in the NLRC decision dated March 26, 1996. 
Thus, Cottonway was ordered to reinstate petitioners to their former 
position without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to 
pay them full backwages. The dispositive portion of the decision read: 




âWHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED. 
Respondent Cottonway Marketing Corporation is hereby ordered to 
reinstate the complainants without loss of seniority rights and other 
privileges and to pay them the following: (1) their proportionate 13th 
month pay for 1994; and (2) their full backwages inclusive of allowances
 and other benefits, or their monetary equivalent computed from the time
 their salaries were withheld from them up to the date of their actual 
reinstatement. 


 SO ORDERED.â  




These are the reliefs afforded to employees whose employment is 
unlawfully severed. Reinstatement restores the employee to the position 
from which he was removed, 
i.e.
, to his status 
quo ante
 dismissal, while
 the grant of backwages allows the same employee to recover from the 
employer that which he lost by way of wages because of his dismissal.
[20]
 


Under R.A. 6715, employees who are illegally dismissed are entitled
 to 
full backwages
, inclusive of allowances and other benefits or their 
monetary equivalent, computed from the time their actual compensation 
was withheld from them up to the time of their actual reinstatement. If 
reinstatement is no longer possible, the backwages shall be computed 
from the time of their illegal termination up to the finality of the 
decision.
[21]
 The Court explained the meaning of âfull backwagesâ in the case of 
Bustamante vs. NLRC
:
[22]
 




âThe Court deems it appropriate, however, to reconsider such 
earlier ruling on the computation of backwages as enunciated in said 
Pines City Educational Center case, by now holding that conformably with
 the evident legislative intent as expressed in Rep. Act No. 6715, 
above-quoted, backwages to be awarded to an illegally dismissed 
employee, should not, as a general rule, be diminished or reduced by the
 earnings derived by him elsewhere during the period of his illegal 
dismissal. The underlying reason for this ruling is that the employee, 
while litigating the legality (illegality) of his dismissal, must still 
earn a living to support himself and family, while full backwages have 
to be paid by the employer as part of the price or penalty he has to pay
 for illegally dismissing his employee. The clear legislative intent of 
the amendment in Rep. Act No. 6715 is to give more benefits to workers 
than was previously given them under the 
Mercury Drug
 rule or the 
"deduction of earnings elsewhere" rule. 
Thus, a closer adherence to the 
legislative policy behind Rep. Act No. 6715 points to "full backwages" 
as meaning exactly that, i.e., without deducting from backwages the 
earnings derived elsewhere by the concerned employee during the period 
of his illegal dismissal
. In other words, the provision calling for 
"full backwages" to illegally dismissed employees is clear, plain and 
free from ambiguity and, therefore, must be applied without attempted or
 strained interpretation. Index 
animi sermo est
.â (italics supplied) 




The Court does not see any reason to depart from this rule in the 
case of herein petitioners. The decision of the NLRC dated March 26, 
1996 has become final and executory upon the dismissal by this Court of 
Cottonwayâs petition for 
certiorari
 assailing said decision and the 
denial of its motion for reconsideration. Said judgment may no longer be
 disturbed or modified by any court or tribunal. It is a fundamental 
rule that when a judgment becomes final and executory, it becomes 
immutable and unalterable, and any amendment or alteration which 
substantially affects a final and executory judgment is void, including 
the entire proceedings held for that purpose. Once a judgment becomes 
final and executory, the prevailing party can have it executed as a 
matter of right, and the issuance of a writ of execution becomes a 
ministerial duty of the court. A decision that has attained finality 
becomes the law of the case regardless of any claim that it is 
erroneous. The writ of execution must therefore conform to the judgment 
to be executed and adhere strictly to the very essential particulars.
[23]
 


To justify the modification of the final and executory decision of 
the NLRC dated March 26, 1996, the Court of Appeals cited the existence 
of a supervening event, that is, the valid termination of petitioners' 
employment due to their refusal to return to work despite notice from 
respondents reinstating them to their former position. 


We cannot concur with said ruling. Petitioners' alleged failure to 
return to work cannot be made the basis for their termination. Such 
failure does not amount to abandonment which would justify the severance
 of their employment. To warrant a valid dismissal on the ground of 
abandonment, the employer must prove the concurrence of two elements: 
(1) the failure to report for work or absence without valid or 
justifiable reason, and (2) a clear intention to sever the 
employer-employee relationship.
[24]
 


The facts of this case do not support the claim of Cottonway that 
petitioners have abandoned their desire to return to their previous work
 at said company. It appears that three months after the NLRC had 
rendered its decision ordering petitionersâ reinstatement to their 
former positions, Cottonway sent individual notices to petitioners 
mandating them to immediately report to work. The standard letter, 
signed by the companyâs legal counsel, Atty. Ambrosio B. De Luna, and 
sent to each of the petitioners read: 




âJune 5, 1996 


Dear Ms. Alivid,
[25]
 


By virtue of the decision of the National Labor Relation(s) 
Commission dated March 26, 1996 in 
Belma Alivid vs. Network Fashion, 
Inc., JCT Intâl Trading and, Cotton Mktg., Corp.
, NLRC CASE NO. 
NCR-010210-96 and NLRC NCR-00-10-07238-94, you are hereby ordered to 
report for work within five (5) days from receipt of this letter, 
otherwise, your failure will be deemed lack of interest to continue and 
considered to have abandoned your employment with the company. 


Please give this matter your utmost attention. 


Very truly your(s), 


(sgd) AMBROSIO B. DE LUNA
Legal Counselâ    
  


The petitioners, however, were not able to promptly comply with the
 order. Instead, their counsel, Atty. Roberto LL. Peralta, sent a reply 
letter to Atty. De Luna stating that his clients were not in a position 
to comply with said order since the NLRC has not yet finally disposed of
 the case. The reply letter stated:
[26]
 




âJune 20, 1996 


ATTY. AMBROSIO B. DE LUNA
Unit 2-D Bouganvilla (sic) Mansions

CompaÃ±ero, 
 
Your letter dated June 5, 1996 to our clients, Erlinda Arga, 
et 
al.
, complainants in NLRC NCR CASE NO. 00-10-07238-94, 
Genalyn

Please be informed that our said clients are not in a position now 
to comply with your order for them to report for work within five (5) 
days from receipt thereof since the National Labor Relations Commission,
 First Division, has yet to finally disposed off (
sic
) the case. 


However, if it is now a case that your client, Mr. Michael Tong, is
 yielding to the Decision dated March 26, 1996 of the NLRC, we are then 
willing to sit down with you relative to the satisfaction of the same to
 avoid said decision from being enforced by the sheriff. 
 
Trusting your cooperation on this matter. 


Thank you. 


Very truly yours, 


(sgd) ROBERTO LL. PERALTA
Counsel For The Complainantsâ    


Consequently, Cottonway sent the petitioners individual notices of 
termination. The standard letter of termination which was likewise 
signed by counsel and individually addressed to petitioners stated: 




âAugust 1, 1996 


BELMA ALIVID
c/o Sonia Flores
#1256-A St. Nino Street
Tondo(,) Manila 
    
Dear Ms. Alivid,
[27]
 


For your failure to report for work as per letter dated June 5, 
1996 within the period of five days from receipt of the same, you are 
considered to have lost your employment status effective this date with 
the company on the ground of failure to report for work. 


Please be guided accordingly. 


Very truly yours, 


(sgd) Ambrosio B. De Luna
Legal Counsel of
Network Fashion(,) Inc.â    




We note that Cottonway, before finally deciding to dispense with 
their services, did not give the petitioners the opportunity to explain 
why they were not able to report to work. The records also do not bear 
any proof that 
all
 the petitioners received a copy of the letters. 
Cottonway merely claimed that some of them have left the country and 
some have found other employment. This, however, does not necessarily 
mean that petitioners were no longer interested in resuming their 
employment at Cottonway as it has not been shown that their employment 
in the other companies was permanent. It should be expected that 
petitioners would seek other means of income to tide them over during 
the time that the legality of their termination is under litigation. 
Furthermore, petitioners never abandoned their suit against Cottonway. 
While the case was pending appeal before the NLRC, the Court of Appeals 
and this Court, petitioners continued to file pleadings to ensure that 
the company would comply with the directive of the NLRC to reinstate 
them and to pay them full backwages in case said decision is upheld. 
Moreover, in his reply to the companyâs first letter, petitionersâ 
counsel expressed willingness to meet with the companyâs representative 
regarding the satisfaction of the NLRC decision. 


It appears that the supposed notice sent by Cottonway to the 
petitioners demanding that they report back to work immediately was only
 a scheme to remove the petitioners for good. Petitionersâ failure to 
instantaneously abide by the directive gave them a convenient reason to 
dispense with their services. This the Court cannot allow. Cottonway 
cited Article 223 of the Labor Code providing that the decision ordering
 the reinstatement of an illegally dismissed employee is immediately 
executory even pending appeal as basis for its decision to terminate the
 employment of petitioners. We are not convinced. Article 223 of the 
Labor Code provides: 




â
ART. 223. Appeal.
 
â Decisions, awards, or 
orders of the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to 
the Commission by any or both parties within ten (10) calendar days from
 receipt of such decisions, awards, or orders. x x x


x x x                                             x x x                                             x x x


In any event, the decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a 
dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the reinstatement aspect is 
concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending appeal. The 
employee shall either be admitted back to work under the same terms and 
conditions prevailing prior to his dismissal or separation or, at the 
option of the employer, merely reinstated in the payroll. The posting of
 a bond by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement 
provided herein. x x x 


x x x                                             x x x                                             x x x.â    




The foregoing provision is intended for the benefit of the employee
 and cannot be used to defeat their own interest. The law mandates the 
employer to either admit the dismissed employee back to work under the 
same terms and conditions prevailing prior to his dismissal or to 
reinstate him in the payroll to abate further loss of income on the part
 of the employee during the pendency of the appeal. But we cannot 
stretch the language of the law as to give the employer the right to 
remove an employee who fails to immediately comply with the 
reinstatement order, especially when there is reasonable explanation for
 the failure. If Cottonway were really sincere in its offer to 
immediately reinstate petitioners to their former positions, it should 
have given them reasonable time to wind up their current preoccupation 
or at least to explain why they could not return to work at Cottonway at
 once. Cottonway did not do either. Instead, it gave them only five days
 to report to their posts and when the petitioners failed to do so, it 
lost no time in serving them their individual notices of termination. We
 are, therefore, not impressed with the claim of respondent company that
 petitioners have been validly dismissed on August 1, 1996 and hence 
their backwages should only be computed up to that time. We hold that 
petitioners are entitled to receive full backwages computed from the 
time their compensation was actually withheld until their actual 
reinstatement, or if reinstatement is no longer possible, until the 
finality of the decision, in accordance with the Decision of the NLRC 
dated March 26, 1996 which has attained finality.
[28]
 


IN VIEW WHEREOF,
 the petition is 
GRANTED
. The 
Decision of the Court of Appeals dated March 13, 2000 and Resolution 
dated February 13, 2001 in CA-G.R. SP No. 53204 are 
REVERSED
 and 
SET 
ASIDE
. Let the records of this case be remanded to the Labor Arbiter for
 execution in accordance with the Decision of the NLRC dated March 26, 
1996.
