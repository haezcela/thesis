CESAR MONTANEZ, PETITIONER,
VS.
NESTOR MENDOZA, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


In general, a petition for review under Rule 45 refers merely to
errors of law allegedly committed by lower courts.  However, as an exception, when the assailed decision of the Court
of Appeals (CA) reverses factual findings of the regional trial court (RTC) and
municipal trial court (MTC), the Supreme Court may pass upon the controverted
issues of fact.  Indeed, in the present
case, the CA erred in reversing the lower courts; thus, it becomes the duty of
this Court to correct the error.


Statement of the Case


Before us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of
the Rules of Court, assailing the April 17, 2000 Decision
[1]
 and
the July 13, 2000 Resolution
[2]
 of
the Court of Appeals in CA-GR SP No. 49368.  The decretal portion of the Decision reads as follows:


âWHEREFORE, the Petition for Review is GRANTED.  [T]he assailed decision of the Municipal
Trial Court of San Mateo, Rizal dated August 1, 1996 in Civil Case No. 1163
which was affirmed by the Regional Trial Court of San Mateo, Rizal, Branch 77
in its decision dated September 16, 1998 is hereby REVERSED and accordingly SET
ASIDE.  Petitioner is furthermore awarded
attorneyâs fees in the sum of 
P
10,000.00â
[3]


The assailed Resolution denied petitionerâs Motion for
Reconsideration.


The reversed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of San Mateo,
Rizal (Branch 77) disposed as follows:


âWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING the appeal.


âThe Decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED IN TOTO.â
[4]


The Facts


The antecedents of the case are summarized by the Court of
Appeals thus:


âSometime in April 1995, [herein Petitioner] Cesar MontaÃ±ez filed a
complaint for forcible entry with damages against Nestor Mendoza before the
Municipal Trial Court of San Mateo, Rizal.  The complainant alleged, among other things, that: he has been in
possession of a parcel of land situated at Sitio Lumbangan, Barangay Pintong
Bukawe (formerly part of Maarat) San Mateo, Rizal consisting of more or less,
six (6) hectares bounded on the east by property of Danilo Laceste, on the west
by property of Herminia Ramos, on the north by a barangay road and on the south
by property of Domingo MontaÃ±ez; that since 1970, he and his family have lived
on the said land cultivated the same by planting crops like ri[c]e, corn,
camote, etc.; that the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office
(CENRO) has certified that he is the actual occupant and possessor of the land
in Sitio Lumbangan, Maarat, San Mateo, Rizal; that sometime in the middle of
May 1994, [private respondent] Nestor Mendoza entered the land and dispossessed
him and his family by force and intimidation; that [private respondent] and his
goons destroyed standing crops and trees planted by private respondent.


âIn his answer, [private respondent] denied the material
allegations in the complaint and as affirmative defense, averred that he built
his house in the land owned and titled in the name of Ramon Mendoza; that he
was expressly authorized by the administrator to construct a house therein as
shown by the Authority to Construct Residential House; that any and all plants,
crops and other improvements that were then and up to now existing in the
aforesaid land also belong to and/or were introduced thereat by the Mendoza
family; that he did not employ armed goons as the land on which his house was
constructed belonged to Ramon Mendoza and at no time did private respondent
occupy said land.


âAfter the proceedings, the Municipal Trial Court rendered a
decision in favor of the [petitioner], the dispositive portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in
favor of plaintiff Cesar MontaÃ±ez and against defendant Nestor Mendoza and all
other persons claiming rights under him, as follows:


1.
            
To vacate the property subject of
this case and surrender possession thereof to plaintiff;


2.
            
To remove the improvements
introduced by him on the subject property;


3.
            
To pay the plaintiff the amount of 
P
5,000.00
as and by way of attorneyâs fees; and


4.
            
To pay the costs.


Defendantâs counterclaims is hereby ordered DISMISSED.


SO ORDERED.â


âAggrieved by the decision, [private respondent] appealed the case
to the Regional Trial [C]ourt of San Mateo, Rizal, Branch 77.  In his appeal, [private respondent] disputed
the finding of the Municipal Trial Court that the land where he built his house
is the same land that has been in possession of [petitioner].  Unfortunately, the Regional Trial Court
upheld the decision of the Municipal Trial Court in favor of [petitioner],
hence, this petition.â
[5]

(Citations omitted)


Ruling of the Court of Appeals


Reversing the RTC and the MTC, the CA ruled that in civil cases,
the burden of proof is on plaintiffs who must establish their allegations by a
preponderance of evidence.
[6]
 It
reasoned that, in the present case, the identity of the land being questioned
by petitioner has not been sufficiently proven to be the same one where
respondent had constructed a house; hence, the issue of the legality of the
formerâs possession of that land cannot be the basis for a forcible entry suit.
[7]

Thus, the present Petition.
[8]


Issues


In his Memorandum, petitioner assigns this sole issue for our
consideration:


âx x x [W]hether or not the Court of Appeals erred in holding that
petitioner has not prove[n] that the property he claims to cultivate is the
same property which respondent took possession [of].â
[9]


Simply put, the issue for resolution is whether petitioner has
sufficiently established his cause of action by a preponderance of evidence.


This Courtâs Ruling


The Petition is meritorious.


Main
Issue:


Sufficiency of Evidence


Petitioner argues that he is entitled to possession of the parcel
of land that is the subject of the forcible entry case, because its area is not
part of that which is covered by OCT No. P-658 in the name of Ramon Mendoza.
[10]


On the other hand, respondent claims that he possesses an
authority to construct a residential house on the latter parcel of land.  He adds that it was incumbent upon
petitioner to adduce substantial evidence to prove that the land from which he
was ousted illegally was the same one from which he had lawfully built the
house in question.
[11]


We agree with petitioner.


An action for forcible entry is a quieting process that is
summary in nature.  It is designed to
recover physical possession through speedy proceedings that are restrictive in
nature, scope and time limits.
[12]
 In
forcible entry, the plaintiff is deprived of physical possession by means of
force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth.
[13]

The presence of any of these elements in the present case implies that the
possession of the disputed land by the defendant has been unlawful from the
beginning; that is, he acquired possession by illegal means.
[14]


Further, it is a basic rule in civil cases that âthe party having
the burden of proof must establish his case by a preponderance of evidence.â
[15]


Preponderance of evidence 
simply
means âevidence which is of greater weight, or more convincing than that which
is offered in opposition to it.â
[16]

Hence, parties who have the burden of proof must produce such quantum of
evidence, with plaintiffs having to rely on the strength of their own evidence,
not on the weakness of the defendantâs.
[17]


In the present ejectment case, petitioner (as plaintiff) has the
burden of proving that he was illegally deprived of possession of the parcel of
land, which is the subject of the forcible entry case.
[18]

To obtain a judgment in his favor, he must therefore establish a preponderance
of evidence for this essential fact.
[19]


Obviously, the issue in this case is shrouded by a conflict in
factual perception, a conflict that is ordinarily not subject to a petition for
review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.
[20]
 But
the Court is constrained to resolve it, because the factual findings of the
Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court.
[21]

Thus, we will rule on such factual issues as an exception to the general rule.
[22]


In this light, we have meticulously scoured the records of this
case and found that the appellate court had erred in appreciating the evidence
presented.
[23]

Respondent failed to provide a reason, let alone an adequate one, to justify
the reversal of the lower courtsâ Decisions.
[24]

Indeed, the findings of the MTC, which were adopted by the RTC, had adequately
supported the allegations in the Complaint.
[25]


First,
 petitioner
alleged and proved that he had been in prior physical possession of the
property in litigation until respondent deprived him of it.
[26]

In ejectment cases, the plaintiff merely needs to prove prior 
de facto
 possession and undue
deprivation thereof.
[27]
 The
sole question for resolution is the physical or material possession (possession

de facto
) of the subject
property.  Neither a claim of juridical possession
(possession 
de jure)
 nor an averment
of ownership
[28]

by the defendant can outrightly prevent the court from taking due cognizance of
the case.
[29]


Petitionerâs actual physical possession has been sufficiently
proven by the Certification
[30]

dated April 10, 1992, issued by Land Management Officer Maximo M. PentiÃ±o of
the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) of the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).  This document lists petitioner as one of the
actual occupants of a parcel of land situated in Sitio Lumbangan, Maarat, San
Mateo, Rizal â the same land that is the subject of the forcible entry
case.  Not having been successfully
overturned, the validity of the Certification, as well as the presumption of
regularity in the performance of official function stands.
[31]

Similarly, if respondent alleges any irregularity in the issuance of the
Certification, he should come forward with clear and convincing proof.
[32]


Petitionerâs prior possession was further corroborated by the Sworn
Statements of Carlito Solano,
[33]

Claudio Laceste Sr.,
[34]

Agripino Madrona,
[35]

Efren Montanez,
[36]

Danilo and George Laceste,
[37]
 and
Alfredo Blanco.
[38]

These affidavits should be given evidentiary value.  The Rule on Summary Procedure precisely provides for the submission
by the parties of affidavits and position papers and enjoins courts to hold
hearings only when it is necessary to do so to clarify factual matters.
[39]

This procedure is in keeping with the objective of the Rule: to promote the
expeditious and inexpensive determination of cases.
[40]


Second,
 not only has
petitioner proven his possession of the parcel of land he had cultivated since
1970, but has also satisfactorily proven the identity of the property.
[41]

There are marked differences between the land that is the subject of the
forcible entry case and that which is covered by OCT No. P-658 in the name of
Ramon Mendoza.


1. The technical description
[42]

prepared by Geodetic Engineer Eleuterio M. de las Alas for the parcel of land
being cultivated by petitioner states that it consists of six hundred fifty-one
thousand nine hundred eighty-one square meters (651,981 sq m) or 6.5 hectares,
more or less.  On the other hand, the
parcel of land covered by OCT No. P-658,
[43]
 Free
Patent No. 045811-91-925, consists of forty-three thousand and fifty-nine
square meters (43,059 sq m) or 4.3 hectares.  For our purposes, a certificate of title is conclusive evidence not only
of ownership of the land referred to, but of other matters as well such as its
technical description and location.
[44]


2. The parcel of land being cultivated by petitioner, as alleged
in the Complaint,
[45]
 is
timberland and thus part of the public domain, while that covered by OCT No.
P-658 is private property.


Third
, it was
categorically stated by Geodetic Engineer Priscillano S. Aguinaldo in his
Affidavit
[46]

dated October 6, 1995, that the area covered by OCT No. P-658 was not the same
as the subject matter of the forcible entry case.  The pertinent portions are quoted hereunder:


âThat, after my d[i]ligent examinations and researches of the
technical descriptions appearing on the above-mentioned Original Certificate of
Title N. P-658; compared to my actual verifications on the ground 
I have
found out that the area covered by the Original Certificate of Title No. 658 is
not the same area which is the subject matter of the Case filed by MR. CESAR
MONTANEZ vs. NESTOR MENDOZA for âFORCIBLE ENTRY
â with the Municipal Trial
Court of San Mateo, Rizal.â (Emphasis in the original)


Fourth,
 while
respondent insists that he constructed a house on a parcel of land that is
covered by OCT No. P-658 and is in the name of Ramon Mendoza, the records of
this case are bereft of evidence to support such allegation.
[47]
  Doubts on the very existence of that parcel
of land actually persist, as shown by the following.
[48]


1. The Registry of Deeds of Marikina issued a Certification
[49]

that âthe original copy of Original/Transfer Certificate of Title No.
P-658/T-409-1093 registered in the name of Ramon F. Mendoza cannot be located,
as of this date [September 28, 1995], in the general file of this Registry
despite diligent efforts exerted to locate the same.â


2. A Memorandum
[50]

dated November 14, 2000, prepared by Rizal Provincial Environment and Natural
Resources Officer Maximo F. Soriano Jr., included OCT No. P-658 in the name of
Ramon Mendoza in the list of questionable titles that had been denounced as
patently defective.


3. Respondent failed to substantiate his assertion that the house
he had allegedly built was within the perimeter of the aforementioned parcel of
land.
[51]
  It is a basic rule on evidence, as clearly
stated in Section 1, Rule 131 of the Rules of Court,
[52]

that affirmative allegations of each party must be proven.
[53]


Verily, petitioner has sufficiently established by a
preponderance of evidence that the subject of the ejectment proceedings is not
the parcel of land covered by OCT No. P-658 in the name of Ramon Mendoza, but
the property alleged in the formerâs Complaint.
[54]

Since petitioner was able to prove his prior possession of the property he
claims and to fix its identity, his action for possession cannot fail.
[55]

Thus, as correctly observed by the MTC, he is entitled to be restored to his
possession thereof, pursuant to Article 539
[56]
 of
the Civil Code.
[57]

Petition is
