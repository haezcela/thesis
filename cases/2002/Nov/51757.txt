SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


In her Memorandum dated June 29, 2001, Atty. Eden T. Candelaria,
Deputy Clerk of Court and Chief Administrative Officer of this Court,
recommended the imposition of administrative penalties upon the twenty-four
(24) employees of this Court who committed habitual tardiness during the second
semester of the year 2000.  Her
recommendation is pursuant to Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum
Circular No. 4, Series of 1991
[1]
 and
CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1999.
[2]
 


On February 20, 2001,
[3]
 the
Leave Division submitted the list of employees who incurred habitual tardiness
for the second semester of the year 2000.  Atty. Candelaria then required those employees to explain within five
days from notice why no disciplinary action should be taken against them.  The following are the names of the employees
and their respective explanations:


1.
       
FE MALOU B. CASTELO,
Court Stenographer II, Office of the Clerk of Court, 
En Banc 
- She incurred tardiness 10 times each in August and
October.  She explained that her
tardiness was due to her severe sore throat constantly accompanied by
fever.  She was advised to undergo
tonsillectomy but it was only on December 14, 2000 that she was operated due to
financial constraints.  She attached
Medical Certificates in support of her explanation.


2.
       
MERCEDITA B.
COSTALES, Court Secretary I, Second Division - Was late for work 13 times in
July and 15 times in August.  She
attributed her tardiness to her insomnia.

NORA B. ANG, Court
Stenographer, Office of the Clerk of Court, First Division - She was tardy 12
times in July, 14 times in October, and 16 times in December.  She explained that she was then undergoing
treatment and physical therapy on her left shoulder and was in her menopausal
stage.  Thus, she has been suffering pain,
weakness and difficulty in moving, especially during December because of the
cold weather.  Moreover, the distance
between her home and the office and the heavy traffic likewise caused her
tardiness.


4.
       
WILFREDO FLORENDO,
Utility Worker II, Office of the Clerk of Court, Second Division - He incurred
habitual tardiness 12 times in July and 10 times in August.  He did not submit any explanation despite

ALBERT SEMILLA, Clerk
III, Office of the Court Attorney - Was late 11 times in July and 10 times in
September.  He claimed that he incurred

dialysis twice a week.

NEWTON ILAGAN,
Administrative Assistant, Maintenance and General Services Division, OAS - He

August.  According to her she attended
to the needs of her cousin who suffered a relapse after giving birth by

work on time.


12.
     
RICARDO PAMINTUAN,
Court Attorney VI, Office of the Chief Justice - He incurred tardiness 13 times
in July and 11 times in December.  He
explained that these months immediately preceded his official training course
abroad for which he had to make numerous preparations.  He had to (1) coordinate with NEDA regarding
the requisites of his scholarship; (2) submit himself to the required
medical/physical examination; (3) file the necessary documents with NEDA; (4)
write his country report and submit it to NEDA and JICA; (5) appear at NEDA for
the panel interview; (6) report to JICA for interviews and briefing; (7) secure
Japanese travel visa; and (8) write and submit a post training report to NEDA,
JICA and the Chief Justice.  Likewise,
the nature of his job and his responsibilities as a court lawyer and as a
project officer constrained him to work at home, even until the wee hours of
the morning.


13.
     
LEO PAGSANJAN,
Executive Assistant II, Office of Justice Jose R. Melo - He was habitually
tardy 15 times in June and 12 times in July.  He stated that he incurred tardiness during these months because his
brother, who was hooked on drugs, exhibited strange behavior that required his

Besides, there were several transport strikes and typhoons those days.

siblings and parents.  Likewise, she had
been experiencing frequent attacks of asthma.


16.
     
ROBERTO HOMERES,
Utility Worker II, Accounting Division, FMBO - He incurred tardiness 10 times
each in August and December.  He claimed
that sometime in August, his son suffered from chicken pox, thus, he had to
make sure that his son took his medicine every morning.  Because of the cold weather in December, his
son who was then enrolled at the Philippine Normal University, had difficulty
in waking up. This was compounded by the heavy traffic during the Christmas
season.


17.

Administrative Services (OAS) - He was habitually tardy 12 times in July, and
10 times each in August and September.  He explained that he lives in DasmariÃ±as, Cavite where transportation
involved a series of transfer from one vehicle to another before reaching this
Court. During those times, he encountered difficulties in taking a ride.  Moreover, there was heavy traffic along the
way due to the on-going government road constructions and improvements.


18.
     
FREDERICK AGUILAR,
Clerk III, Personnel Division, OAS - He was late 11 times in October and 14
times in December.  He explained that he
suffered asthma attacks in October which caused him sleepless nights.  For his tardiness in December, he claimed

season and the preparation for the renewal of appointments of casual employees.

traffic congestion.


21.
     
SHIRLEY MAY SANTOS,
Clerk III, Property Division, OAS - She was habitually tardy 12 times each in
October and November.  She explained
that her tardiness was due to nausea which constrained her to stay in bed until
she was relieved.

Fiscal Clerk I, Financial Services Division, FMBO - He incurred tardiness 11
times each in September and October, and 12 times in December.  He stated that he resides in Molino, Bacoor,

Worker II, Medical Division, Medical and Dental Services - He incurred habitual
tardiness 12 times in August, 14 times in November and 10 times in

who underwent surgery.

JASMIN CELOCIA,
Utility Worker II, Printing Services - She incurred tardiness 11 times in June
and 10 times in July.  She explained
that she is a single parent with 2 kids, aged 2 and 1.  As such, she had to wait every morning for

In the same Memorandum, Atty. Candelaria reported that in the
past (1999 and 2000), Castelo, Costales, Ang, Florendo and Lorico incurred
habitual tardiness and were meted the penalties of reprimand and suspension from
the service.


Likewise, Sasis, Semilla and Borja were previously reprimanded,
while Ramirez, Ilagan and Jupia were sternly warned for habitual tardiness in
the first semester of 2001.


In her Memorandum, Atty. Candelaria recommended that:


âA. The following employees who have committed habitual tardiness

[4]
 


We affirm the recommendation of Atty. Candelaria.


CSC Memorandum Circular No. 4, Series of 1991 states:


âAn employee shall be considered habitually tardy if he incurs
tardiness, regardless of the number of minutes, ten (10) times a month for at
least two (2) months in a semester or at least two (2) consecutive months
during the year.â


CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19 Series of 1999 amended CSC
Memorandum Circular No. 4 and provided for the following penalties for habitual
tardiness:


âFirst Offense - Reprimand


Second Offense - Suspension for 1-30 days 


Third Offense - Dismissal.â


It is clear that the above-named employees committed habitual
tardiness.  Their explanations failed to
justify their tardiness and exemption from the imposition of the penalties
provided in CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19.


In the case of Castelo, Costales, Ang, Florendo and Lorico, this
is the third time they committed the same offense of tardiness.  Pursuant to CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19,
they should be dismissed from the service.  However, for humanitarian  considerations, we find the penalty of suspension for three months
without pay, as recommended by Atty. Candelaria, to be in order.  Nevertheless, they are warned that this
Court will dismiss them from the service should they commit the same offense in
the future.


Moral obligations, performance of household chores, traffic
problems and health, domestic and financial concerns are not sufficient reasons
to excuse habitual tardiness, although these may be considered to mitigate
administrative liability.


By their habitual tardiness, the herein employees have failed to
live up to the standard of conduct set by this Court.  Tardiness causes inefficiency and is prejudicial to public
service.  The need for strict observance
of official time has been emphasized by this Court in Administrative Circular
No. 1-99 
(Enhancing the Dignity of Courts
as Temples of Justice and Promoting Respect for their Officials and Employees)
[5]
 
and Administrative Circular No. 2-99 
(Strict Observance of Working Hours and
Disciplinary Action for Absenteeism and Tardiness) 
which respectively
provide:


âx x x


â3. Strictly observe official time.  As punctuality is a virtue, absenteeism and tardiness are
impermissible.â


âx x x. Absenteeism and tardiness, even if such do not qualify as
âhabitualâ or âfrequentâ under Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No.
4, Series of 1991, shall be dealt with severely x x x.â


In Belvis vs. Fernandez,
[6]
 this
Court held:


âxxx. There is no question that respondent is prejudicing public
service with frequent absences and tardiness.  His conduct certainly falls short of the standards prescribed by the
Constitution for public officers and employees, to wit: âA public office is a
public trust.  Public officers and
employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost
responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and
justice, and lead modest lives.ââ


Also, in 
Basco vs.
Gregorio,
[7]
 
this Court ruled:


âThe exacting standards of ethics and morality imposed upon court
employees and judges are reflective of the premium placed on the image of the
court of justice, and that image is necessarily mirrored in the conduct,
official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat.  It thus becomes the imperative and sacred
duty of everyone charged with the dispensation of justice, from the judge to
the lowliest clerk, to maintain the courtâs good name and standing as true
temples of justice.  Circumscribed with
the heavy burden of responsibility, their conduct at all times must not only be
characterized with propriety and decorum, but above all else, must be above
suspicion.  Indeed, every employee of
the Judiciary should be an example of integrity, probity, uprightness, honesty
and diligence. x x xâ (emphasis added)
