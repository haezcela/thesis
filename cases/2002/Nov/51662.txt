TALA REALTY SERVICES CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS.
BANCO FILIPINO SAVINGS AND MORTGAGE BANK, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




PUNO, J.:


A four-page contract executed by the parties more than two
decades ago spurred the present controversy.  The records of the case total thousands of pages, but no amount and
fashion of words can forever bury or hide the truth.  Justice will be dispensed to both parties and each would pay the
price for its deception.


This is a petition for review on certiorari to annul and set
aside the Court of Appealsâ December 18, 1998 decision and February 17, 1999
resolution affirming the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos,
Bulacan, Branch 78, which dismissed petitionerâs action for ejectment.


Petitioner Tala Realty Services Corporation (âTalaâ) alleges that
it is the absolute owner of nine parcels of land and their improvements located
in Manila, Malabon, Marikina City, La Union, Lucena City, Iloilo City, Davao
City, Pangasinan, and Bulacan by virtue of separate Deeds of Absolute Sale
executed between Tala and the respondent Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage
Bank (the âBankâ) on August 25, 1981.  The Bulacan property is the subject matter of this case.
[1]


On that same day, August 25, 1981, Tala and the Bank entered into
separate lease contracts over the aforementioned nine properties.  The contracts had the same form and terms,
except for the description of the property and the amount of the monthly
rentals.  The contracts provided for twenty-year
lease periods renewable for another twenty years at the option of the
Bank.  The monthly rental for the
Bulacan property was 
P
9,800.00.
[2]


Later that same day, the parties revised these nine lease
contracts.  The terms of the lease were
shortened to eleven years renewable for a period of nine years âat the option
of the lessee under terms and conditions mutually agreeable to both
parties.â  The monthly rental for the
Bulacan property remained 
P
9,800.00.
[3]


Almost eleven years after the execution of the nine lease
contracts, or on August 19, 1992, Talaâs director, Elizabeth H. Palma, wrote to
the Bank reminding the latter that the contracts were about to expire on August
31, 1992, and that the Bank had earlier signified its interest to renew the
lease contracts.  The letter also
indicated that Tala was open to discuss the terms and conditions of the renewal
of the lease âsubject to the condition that the lease rate which may be
mutually agreed upon shall retroact to September 1, 1992.â  Meantime, Tala would lease the properties to
the Bank on a month-to-month basis until the agreement was finalized.
[4]


On January 20, 1993, the Bank requested Tala to send its
representative to the Bankâs office to negotiate the renewal of the lease.
[5]
 
Talaâs director,
Elizabeth Palma, negotiated the renewal and submitted a proposal for increased
rental.  In its February 10, 1993 letter
to the Bank, Tala reiterated the increased rental which was agreed upon in the
previous negotiation.  It also stated
that Tala was charging the Bank goodwill money for the renewal of the lease to
cover the substantial losses it incurred during the period of the lease and
upon its expiration when Tala was holding the lease sites for the Bank and
turning down more profitable offers.  The new monthly rental rate for the Bulacan property was 
P
31,800.00.


On March 4, 1993, the Bank requested Tala to furnish it some
documents regarding the lease of Talaâs properties.  For several months from the time of negotiation, the Bank failed
to take action on Talaâs proposed terms for the renewal of the lease contract,
prompting Tala to write to the Bank on June 22, 1993; it billed the Bank the
difference between the old monthly rental rate of 
P
9,800.00 it had been
paying for the past ten months and the increased rate of 
P
31,800.00
[6]

which, according to Tala, was agreed upon by the parties during the
negotiation.
[7]
 
  Tala also informed the Bank in its June 22,
1993 letter that since it had been ten months since the expiration of the lease
contracts in August 1992 and the Bank had not taken any definite action to
renew the contracts despite being furnished copies of the same in December
1992, Tala declared itself free to âlease, dispose, sell and/or in any way
alienate the bank branch sites subject of the lease agreement.â
[8]


The Bank responded on June 29, 1993, clarifying that it was the
Bank which had the option to renew the lease and that it had communicated to
Tala it was exercising its option to do so.  However, Tala failed to furnish some documents relevant to the lease the
Bank had earlier requested.  The Bank
needed the requested documents to help clear up (1) its sale of the leased
properties to Tala and (2) the basis of its lease negotiations with the latter,
but could not find the pertinent deeds of sale and lease contracts over some of
the lease sites.  On January 15, 1985,
the Central Bank closed the Bank, placed it under receivership, and took
possession of its records; but this Court in 1991 declared the closure null and
void, and the records were returned.  However,
the Bank could not find in the returned records some deeds of sale, lease
contracts, and transfer certificates of title regarding the properties Tala
leased to it.
[9]


From the time the lease contract over the Bulacan property
expired in August 1992 until March 1994, the Bank continued to occupy the
subject Bulacan property.  It paid Tala
monthly rentals at the old rate of 
P
9,800.00 from September 1, 1992
until March 1994, but refused to pay the 
P
22,000.00 difference between
the old monthly rate and the new rate of 
P
31,800.00.  Beginning April 1994 until the filing of the
instant case, however, the Bank did not pay any rent at all.  Nor did it pay the goodwill money and
deposit Tala required for the renewal of the lease.
[10]
 


On April 14, 1994, Tala wrote to the Bank demanding payment of
the latterâs outstanding obligations of 
P
1,102,440.00 over the Bulacan
property, consisting of unpaid rental adjustment of 
P
440,260.00, deposit
of 
P
127,200.00, and goodwill money of 
P
500,000.00.  Tala also informed the Bank that at the end
of the month, the month-to-month lease would no longer be renewed, thus, it
should vacate the premises by that time, otherwise, petitioner would resort to
legal action.
[11]
  Still, the Bank refused to pay its
outstanding obligations, prompting Talaâs lawyer to write to it on May 2, 1994
demanding the latter to vacate the premises and to pay its outstanding
obligation within five days from receipt of the letter, otherwise a legal
action would be filed against it.
[12]
 
  The petitioner wrote similar letters for the
nine other properties it leased to the Bank.
[13]


As the Bank did not comply with Talaâs demands, the latter filed
complaints for ejectment and/or unlawful detainer in the courts where the nine
properties are located.  The complaint
in the case at bar was filed in the Municipal Trial Court of Malolos on
November 11, 1994.
[14]
 
Tala prayed therein
that the Bank vacate the premises, and pay it 
P
653,638.00 accrued
rentals as of September 30, 1994 and rental of 
P
42,325.00 a month with
an annual 10% escalation from October 1994 until it vacates the premises, and
to pay the costs.
[15]


Parenthetically, on August 5, 1985, while the Bank was closed,
placed under receivership and being liquidated by order of the Monetary Board,
counsel for the Bankâs liquidator wrote Tala regarding the lease contracts that
have expired and others that would expire in 2001.  It appeared from some lease contracts that the Bank had paid Tala
advance rentals/deposits amounting to 
P
13,937,300.00 which were to cover
rentals accruing from the eleventh to the twentieth year of the lease, 
i.e.
, from 1992 to 2001.  Since the Bank was under liquidation at that
time and had no more need for the leased premises for that ten-year period, the
liquidatorâs counsel asked Tala to apply the advance deposit to the rentals of
the properties totaling 
P
423,550.00 a month for the period during which
the Bank was closed and under receivership.
[16]
 


In a letter dated October 7, 1987, Talaâs lawyer replied to the
counsel of the Bankâs liquidator that the amended 11-year lease contracts of
August 25, 1981 provided for the payment of security deposits and not advance
rentals so that said payment could not be used to cover unpaid rentals during
the period that the Bank was closed and under receivership and liquidation.  According to Talaâs lawyer, the only time
that said security deposits may be applied to unpaid rents is when the rentals
for the last year of the lease contracts were not paid, but the lease contracts
were still due to expire in 1992.
[17]
 The
Bank, therefore, could not apply the security deposits to the payment of
rentals and thus had to pay its accrued rentals.  However, on February 21, 1990, the Bankâs liquidator wrote Tala
informing the latter that it had approved payment of accrued rents on Talaâs
properties leased by the Bank, less the security deposit of 
P
13,937,300.00
that the Bank had earlier paid for all the properties it leased from Tala.  The letter indicated that the total rent due
on all the leased properties as of November 1989 was 
P
19,169,625.00.  Applying the security deposit of 
P
13,937,300.00
to this amount, the net amount due Tala for unpaid rent as of November 1989 was

P
5,232,325.00.  The
representative of Tala, Elizabeth H. Palma, agreed to this net amount due for
unpaid rent as of November 1989 and signed in the liquidatorâs letter to show
conformity to said net amount.
[18]
 Of
the unpaid rent due as of November 1989, 
P
509,600.00 was due with
respect to the Bulacan property for the period covering August 1985 to November
1989
.
[19]

Petitioner notes that since the Bank paid only 
P
487,500.00 advance
rental/security deposits on the Bulacan property, there was still a balance of 
P
22,100.00
to be paid by the Bank.
[20]


The Bank had a different story to tell.


In 1979, the Bank undertook an expansion program, part of which
was to purchase the present site of its head office at corner Paseo de Roxas
and Dela Rosa Streets in Makati City.  At that time, however, it had already reached the limit for real estate
investment set by Sections 25(a) and 34 of Rep. Act No. 337 or the General
Banking Act, as amended, 
viz
:


âSec. 25.  Any commercial
bank may purchase, hold and convey real estate for the following purposes:


(a)
     
such as shall be necessary for its
immediate accommodation in the transaction of its business: Provided, however,
that the total investment in such real estate and improvements thereof,
including bank equipment, shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of net worth:
Provided, further, That real estate used for the bankâs purposes, owned by
another corporation in which the bank owns equity, shall be considered as part
of the bankâs total investment in real estate.

Sec. 34.  Savings and
mortgage banks may purchase, hold and convey real estate under the same
conditions as those governing commercial banks as specified in Section 25 of
this Act.â


To avoid exceeding the limit set by law as it pursued its
expansion program, the Bank had to reduce its branch site holdings and merely
lease, instead of own or buy, branch sites.  The matter of reducing the Bankâs existing branch site holdings and
leasing them, and leasing new properties instead of buying them was taken up by
Nancy Lim Ty, then senior vice president and director of the Bank, with Tomas
Aguirre and other major stockholders.
[21]
 The
major stockholders agreed to form an allied corporation to which the Bankâs
existing branch sites could be unloaded and leased back from, and which would
acquire new branch sites for the Bank that the latter would lease.  That allied corporation is the petitioner
Tala.  It was originally named Alta
Realty Services Corporation, but its name was changed to Tala Realty Services
Corporation upon registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
as there was already an entity named Alta.  Alta or Tala is an acronym formed by the first letters of the family
names of four major stockholders of the Bank, namely Antonio 
T
iu, Tomas B. 
A
guirre, Nancy 
L
im Ty,
and Pedro B. 
A
guirre.  These four major stockholders contributed 
P
250,000.00
each to put up a 
P
1,000,000.00 capital for Tala.  The names of the four, however, did not
appear in Talaâs incorporation papers, and instead the names of their nominees
appeared therein.
[22]


On August 18, 1981, the Bankâs Board of Directors voted to
authorize the negotiation for sale and conclusion of an agreement to sell
eleven of their branch sites, including the subject Bulacan property which was
to be sold for 
P
975,000.00.
[23]
 The
sale was part of a âwarehousing agreementâ
[24]

between the Bank and Tala, 
viz
:


âThe Respondent (Bank) was to transfer or unload
[25]
 
a number of its
existing branch sites to the Petitioner (Tala) and the latter was to
simultaneously lease them back to the former.  New branch sites which the Respondent will be disqualified from buying,
by reason of the aforecited limitations under existing banking laws and
regulations, will be acquired for it by the Petitioner which will forthwith
lease them to the Respondent.  Any or
all of these branch sites will be returned or reconveyed to the Respondent by
the Petitioner at the formerâs demand or pleasure at the same transfer or
acquisition cost.â
[26]


On August 25, 1981, in accordance with this âwarehousing
agreement,â the Bank executed in favor of Tala eleven separate deeds of
absolute sale, transferring to the latter eleven branch sites, including the
subject Bulacan property.
[27]
 On
the same day, Tala executed in favor of the Bank eleven separate contracts of
lease over the eleven properties, leasing the branch sites for a term of twenty
years ârenewable for another period of twenty (20) years, at the option of the
LESSEE.â
[28]

All eleven lease contracts were uniform except for the amounts of monthly
rentals and advance rentals.  All eleven
contracts provided the Bank a âfirst preference to buyâ
[29]

which was meant to express the above agreement between the Bank and Tala that
âany or all of these branch sites will be returned or reconveyed to the
Respondent by the Petitioner at the formerâs demand or pleasure at the same
transfer or acquisition cost.â  This
agreement to reconvey was not spelled out in the lease contracts because the
Bank was apprehensive that it might provide basis for the Central Bank to
question the sale and simultaneous lease back of the branch sites between the
Bank and Tala, for being merely simulated, and thereby derail the Bankâs
expansion program.  But the Bank was
nevertheless confident that Tala would honor the agreement though not written
ânot only because among bankers, commitments, though not written, are as
binding and are honored as written ones, but also because the Bank was dealing
with an entity owned and backed up by four major stockholders of the Bank:
three of whom, namely, Antonio Tiu, Nancy Lim Ty and Pedro Aguirre, were
members of the Bankâs Board of Directors at that time, with one of them, Nancy
Lim Ty, also Senior Vice President at the same time; and the fourth, Tomas
Aguirre, was the founder of the Bank who, in his Affidavit, confirmed the
Agreement.â
[30]

That the Bank intended to keep the leased properties can be gleaned from the
fact that as of the filing of the instant case, more than ten years after their
sale, their titles remain in the name of the Bank as shown by TCT No. RT-39662
(T-261735) and RT-39663 (T-261736) of the Registry of Deeds of the Province of
Bulacan.
[31]


As Tala had only 
P
1,000,000.00 paid-up capital as of
August 25, 1981, while the combined selling price of the Bankâs branch sites
being unloaded to it was nearly 
P
30,000,000.00, the Bank and Tala
devised a way for Tala to pay the selling price through loans and the Bankâs
payment of advance rentals.  The eleven
lease contracts provided for payment of substantial advance rentals for the
eleventh to the twentieth year of the 20-year contracts of lease.  These advance rentals in the eleven lease
contracts were applied to the purchase price stipulated in the eleven deeds of
absolute sale.  The balance of the
purchase price was paid through loans obtained by Tala, through the
intercession of the Bank, from Pacific Bank and Metrobank with the branch sites
as collaterals.  The monthly rental
rates for the lease of the eleven properties were pegged at an amount that
would allow Tala to meet the amortizations for said loans and retain 3% of the
rentals as compensation for its services.
[32]
 
  On December 18, 1981, the Bank paid Tala
advance rental in the amount of 
P
487,500.00 and monthly rentals of 
P
39,200.00
for the period covering September 1981 to December 1981 at 
P
9,800.00 per
month over the Bulacan property, less withholding tax of 
P
26,335.00, or
a total of 
P
500,365.00.
[33]


On January 25, 1985, the Central Bank closed the Bank, placed it
under receivership, and took over all of its assets, books and records to the
exclusion of the Bankâs board of directors and management.  The latter questioned the closure in several
cases, among which was 
Banco Filipino
Savings and Mortgage Bank v. Monetary Board, Central Bank of the Philippines.
[34]

In this case decided on December 11, 1991, the Court ruled that the Central
Bankâs closure of the Bank was null and void for having been effected
arbitrarily and with grave abuse of discretion.
[35]
 As
this decision became final and executory on February 4, 1992, the Bank on
February 6, 1992 demanded from the Central Bank the immediate return of its
assets, records and books of account.
[36]

After about two months, the Central Bank complied with the Bankâs demand, but
returned the records in trickles.


In mid-1992, when the Bank was still in the process of recovering
its assets, records, and books of account from the Central Bank, it received
notice from Tala that the Bankâs lease over a number of its branches, including
the subject Bulacan property, was expiring in August 1992.  Tala urged the Bank to negotiate with it for
the renewal of the lease.  As the
Central Bank had not completed the turn-over of the Bankâs records, the Bank asked
Tala to furnish it with copies of the lease contracts which were about to
expire.  Tala took a while to furnish
copies of said contracts and when it did, it furnished the Bank with lease
contracts executed on August 25, 1981 which provided for an eleven-year lease
term renewable for another nine years.
[37]
 The
Bank could not simply ignore Talaâs demand to negotiate the renewal of the
lease and thus met with Talaâs representatives.  At the same time, however, the Bank pressed the Central Bank to
return the contracts of lease over its branch sites since its officers recalled
that the lease contracts were executed as part of an agreement to unload its
branch sites to Tala and that the contracts provided not for eleven-year, but
twenty-year lease terms.  Subsequently,
the Central Bank returned the lease contracts over the branch sites, and just
as the Bankâs officers recalled, said contracts showed a lease term of twenty
years, renewable for another twenty years at the option of the Bank.  Nowhere in the records could be found a
lease contract for eleven years due to expire in August 1992 and renewable for
nine years, similar to those Tala furnished the Bank.


The Bank investigated the matter and based on its findings, its
board of directors directed the management to demand from Tala the return or
reconveyance of its branch sites in accordance with their 1981 âwarehousing
agreement.â  The Bank posits that this
agreement is one of implied trust where Tala as trustee or holder of the legal
title over the leased properties had the duty to reconvey the properties to the
Bank which was both the trustor and beneficiary.  The Bank further claims that it is entitled to possession of the
subject Bulacan property as an incident of its ownership of the property.  In a letter from the Bank to Tala dated
April 12, 1994, the Bank demanded the return of the subject property.
[38]


In early 1994, the Bank's minority stockholders also filed a
derivative suit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against
Talaâs stockholders, officers and directors
[39]

seeking principally to nullify the unloading or âwarehousing agreementâ between
the Bank and Tala and the return or reconveyance to the Bank of all the branch
sites it had unloaded to Tala, including the subject Bulacan property.  Tala moved to dismiss the suit on the ground
of lack of jurisdiction over the nature and subject matter of the action.  The SEC denied its motion.
[40]

The Bank posits that it was the April 12, 1994 letter and the derivative suit
filed with the SEC that precipitated the filing of the instant case in the
Municipal Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan (MTC of Malolos), as well as eight
other ejectment cases involving the other âwarehousedâ properties.


After weighing the evidence adduced by both parties, the MTC of
Malolos ruled in favor of the Bank, 
viz
:


âWell-settled is the rule that the main issue in an action for an
unlawful detainer is determination of who between the rival claimants has
better right of possession to property (Dolido vs. CA, 17 SCRA 400).  From the evidence on record the herein
defendant has a better right of possession over the subject property on the
basis of a Contract of Lease dated August 25, 1981 (Exh. â5â) wherein it
states, among other things, that the term of the lease is for twenty (20) years.  Hence, the said lease will commence from
August 25, 1981 and will end on August 5, 2001 (
sic
).


It cannot be said that the defendant failed to comply with the
terms and conditions of the said Contract of Lease (Exh. â5â), particularly the
alleged non-payment of rentals thereof considering the provision of paragraph 3
of the said Contract of Lease.  The
defendant herein has paid to the plaintiff on December 18, 1981 (Exhibit â13â)
the sum of FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY-SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PESOS (
P
487,500.00)
as advance rentals, to be applied to the rentals due from the eleventh (11
th
)
through the twentieth (20
th
) years of the lease or from 1992 through
the year 2001.


The alleged amended Contract of Lease executed by Banco Filipino
and TALA Realty dated August 26, 1981 (
sic
),
marked as Annex âAâ in the  complaint
wherein the term of the lease has been fixed âfor a period of eleven (11)
years, renewable for another period of nine (9) years at the option of the
LESSEE under terms and conditions mutually agreeable to the partiesâ cannot be
given credence at all considering that the original of the same were (
sic
) not submitted before the Honorable
Court.  The best evidence to prove the
existence of a certain document, the contents of which is the subject of inquiry,
is the original of the same. . . 


Although this court has no authority or jurisdiction to pronounce
that the contract of lease (Exh. âAâ for the plaintiff) is either genuine,
simulated or fictitious, but (
sic
)
this court cannot hesitate to believe that the said Contract of Lease, with a
period of eleven years, is spurious or fictitious.  Even Mr. Teodoro O. Arcenas, Jr. who made (
sic
) to appear in the said Contract of Lease having signed the (
sic
) same for and on behalf of the
defendant bank, in his capacity as executive Vice-President thereof denies
having signed the same. . .


Needless to say that (
sic
)
even the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Manila certified that
the notarized Contract (
sic
) of Lease
allegedly notarized by Rolando C. Salonga, a notary public for and in the City
of Manila, on August 26, 1981 was never reported to that office by the said
notary public as required by the notarial law.  (Exh. â15â of the Position Paper for the Defendant)


This court cannot (
sic
)
inclined to believe that for (
sic
) a
corporation, as in the instant case Banco Filipino, to execute two (2) Contract
(
sic
) of Lease almost on the same
date involving the same property. (
sic
)
If the Contract of Lease for eleven (11) years was really executed by the same
party (
sic
) and almost at the same
time, a provision would have been inserted to state that the previous Contract
of Lease for twenty (20) years, executed one day prior to the execution of the
Contract of Lease with a period of 11 years, is rescinded or amended, (
sic
) as the case may be.  But in (
sic
)
the alleged subsequent Contract of Lease provides nothing about it.  Besides only (
sic
) Contract of Lease with a period of twenty years was submitted
to the Central Bank.


Even on the assumption that these two (2) Contract (
sic
) of Lease (Exh. â5â for the
defendant and Exh. âAâ for the plaintiff) are valid and effective as this Court
has likewise no jurisdiction to declare either or both contract, as well as
null and void, rescinded or amended, (
sic
)
the defendant has clearly proven by the preponderance of evidence that it
(defendant) has a better right to possess the subject property considering the
validity of the said Contract of Lease (Exhibit â5â for the defendant) stands
valid and effective.

In the verified complaint in the present case, plaintiff admits
that there is a pending case before the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), SEC Case No. 04-94-4750, a derivative suit filed by some stockholders of
the defendant bank, for and on its behalf, against the herein plaintiff and
other parties, and that said case âseek, among others, the reconveyance of
certain properties including the subject matter hereof and prays for the
ancillary remedy of restraining any rental collection.â  (Paragraph 3 of the Complaint)

Clearly, therefore, that which the plaintiff seeks in this case in
(
sic
) the ejectment of the defendant
bank from the premises in question and the collection of goodwill, deposit and
adjusted rentals are the very acts sought to be restrained in SEC Case No.
04-94-4750. . .


This Court believes that the instant case is an example of forum
shopping considering that the essential facts and circumstances pending in the
Securities and Exchange Commission are practically the same facts and
circumstances pending before this Court.


On this score alone the instant complaint should be dismissed.â
[41]


The Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 78 (âRTC of
Malolosâ) dismissed petitionerâs appeal of the decision of the MTC of Malolos
for lack of merit, 
viz
:


âThe core of the controversy involved in this case revolves around
the issue of which of the two (2) contracts of lease, involving the same
premises, should be upheld.  One lease
contract, providing for a rent period of twenty (20) years and the other,
providing for an eleven-year period.  Defendant claims that the latter contract is spurious.  Plaintiff-appellant, on the other hand,
contends that the 11-year contract was validly executed superseding the 20-year
lease agreement.


Sustaining the defendant's claim would make valid its continued
stay on the questioned premises and would leave the plaintiff without any cause
to evict the defendant.  On the other
hand, to uphold the plaintiffâs 11-year lease contract would give the
plaintiff-appellant every right to eject the defendant.


Declaring one contract spurious which resultantly declares the
other valid is not within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Court.  An action to declare one of the said
contracts valid is an action which is incapable of pecuniary estimation and is
therefore cognizable by the Regional Trial Courts.  Furthermore, such issue is not proper in an ejectment suit.  It must be properly decided in a separate
action filed for that purpose and threshed out before the proper forum.  Absent such finding, ejectment suit against
the defendant bank would be premature.


As to the other issues raised, this Court believes, and so holds,
that discussion of the same would be futile in view of the above expositions.â
[42]


On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the decision of the RTC of
Malolos was affirmed, 
viz
:


âThe issue in an ejectment case is the right to physical possession
of the premises or possession de facto (Del Rosario v. Court of Appeals, 241
SCRA 519).  Respondentâs assertion of a
different contractual relations (
sic
)
with petitioner and its introduction into evidence of a different contract of
lease having a 20-year term, which contract was indeed the first instrument
executed by the parties, as admitted by petitioner, put into issue the real
nature of the contract between the parties, and further bring into fore a
second issue: which of the two lease contracts embodies the real agreement
between the parties.  As correctly
stated by the Regional Trial Court, this would necessitate a determination of
the validity of one contract and conversely, a pronouncement as to the
invalidity of the other.

There can be no determination by the Municipal Trial Court of
whether petitioner had the right to eject respondent from the premises until
the real nature of its transactional relations with respondent is first settled
and also until the question of which contract is binding upon the parties is
finally resolved.  Since the
determination of the contractual relations between the parties and the issue of
validity of contracts are beyond the jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Court
to adjudicate or pass upon, and the summary action for ejectment which is a
mere quieting process could not proceed until the aforesaid issues have been
resolved, the Municipal Trial Court did not err in dismissing the
complaint.  Similarly, the Regional
Trial Court did not commit a reversible error in holding that the Municipal
Trial Court had no jurisdiction over the issues of the case and that the
complaint for ejectment was premature.  Indeed, petitioner should have filed, instead, a plenary action before
the proper Regional Trial Court for quieting of title and recovery of possession,
in which proceeding the real contract between it and respondent and their
respective rights and obligations thereunder could be fully ventilated and
determined.


With regard to the second assignment of error, since the ejectment
suit was premature, there was no reason or need for the court a quo to pass
upon the question of whether sufficient grounds existed to eject respondent
from the leased premises.â
[43]


Hence, this petition for review with the following assignment of
errors:


âI.


THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING
THAT THE MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT OF MALOLOS, BULACAN HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE
INSTANT COMPLAINT FOR EJECTMENT BECAUSE RESPONDENT HAVING PRESENTED A DIFFERENT
SET OF CONTRACT OF LEASE IN ITS ANSWER TRANSFORMED THIS SUIT INTO ONE INCAPABLE
OF PECUNIARY ESTIMATION.


II.


THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT HOLDING
THAT SUFFICIENT GROUNDS EXIST TO EJECT RESPONDENT FROM THE LEASED PREMISES.â
[44]


At the outset, the Bank clarifies that Talaâs first assignment of
error is inaccurate.  The Bank points
out that the Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal of the instant case by the
MTC of Malolos on two jurisdictional grounds:  (1) it did not have jurisdiction to determine whether the 20-year or
11-year lease contract was valid and genuine, which transformed the instant
suit into one incapable of pecuniary estimation, and (2) it did not have
jurisdiction to resolve the preliminary issue of the real nature of the
contractual relation between Tala and the Bank.
[45]
 The
latter issue necessitates a determination of whether there was indeed a lessor-lessee
relationship between the parties, or their transaction partook of an implied
trust where the Bank was the trustor and beneficiary and Tala was the trustee
with an obligation to return the subject Bulacan property to the Bank upon the
latterâs demand.


The Bank also asserts that the MTC of Malolos was correct in
dismissing the complaint for ejectment on the ground that Tala was guilty of
forum shopping in that it filed the complaint for ejectment after the SECâs
denial of its motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the
subject matter in SEC Case No. 04-94-4750, the derivative suit filed in the SEC
by the Bankâs minority stockholders for and on behalf of the Bank against Tala.
[46]

The Bank is of the view that as pronounced by the MTC of Malolos, âthe
essential facts and circumstances pending in the Securities and Exchange
Commission are practically the same facts and circumstances pending before the
Court.â
[47]


A careful perusal of the decisions of the MTC of Malolos, RTC of
Malolos and Court of Appeals would show the following grounds for their
dismissal of the cases before them:


1.  The MTC of Malolos
dismissed the complaint for ejectment on the ground of forum shopping as the
ejectment and collection of goodwill money, deposit and adjusted rentals in the
instant case are the very acts sought to be restrained by the Bankâs minority
stockholders in the derivative suit pending in the SEC.  The MTC decision also discussed that the
20-year lease contract was valid and genuine and that the Bank had a better
right to possess the subject Bulacan property, while the 11-year contract was
spurious and fictitious and its original copy was not presented to the
court.  The court concluded, however,
that it could not uphold or strike down either contract as it had no
jurisdiction to determine the validity of these contracts.


2.  The RTC of Malolos
dismissed the appeal of the MTC decision and affirmed that the MTC of Malolos
had no jurisdiction to declare a contract valid or invalid as this involves an
action incapable of pecuniary estimation cognizable by the Regional Trial
Court.  In addition, the RTC of Malolos
ruled that such issue is not proper in an ejectment suit.


3.  The Court of Appeals
dismissed the petition for review on the ground that the MTC had no
jurisdiction to determine two issues: (1) the nature of the contractual
relations between the Bank and Tala; and (2) the validity of the 11-year and
the 20-year contracts.  Since these
issues must first be resolved, the summary action for ejectment was premature
and thus could not proceed.


The Memoranda of Tala and the Bank discuss all the grounds upon
which the MTC of Malolos, RTC of Malolos and Court of Appeals based their
dismissal of the actions before them.  To avoid further prolonging litigation and to settle the foregoing
issues which involve not only the subject Bulacan property but other properties
leased by Tala to the Bank, we will tackle these grounds one by one.


We first deal with the forum shopping issue.  For forum shopping to exist, both actions -
the derivative suit in the SEC and the instant ejectment case filed in the MTC
of Malolos - must involve the same transactions, same essential facts and
circumstances, and must raise identical causes of actions, subject matter and
issues.
[48]
  While the SEC case seeking annulment of the
sale of the Bankâs properties by âwarehousing agreementâ with Tala includes the
transactions and subject matter as well as the essential facts and
circumstances of the instant ejectment suit, the causes of action and issues in
the two cases are different.  In the SEC
case, the Bankâs minority stockholders seek the reconveyance of its branch
sites transferred to Tala through the âwarehousing agreementâ in 1981 on the
ground that their sale was simulated and fictitious and without valuable
consideration, thus the Bank was the true owner of the âwarehousedâ
properties.  On the other hand, in the
instant ejectment suit, Tala seeks physical possession or 
possession de facto
 of the subject Bulacan property and does not
deal with the issue of ownership brought to the fore by an allegation that the
sale of the subject Bulacan property is simulated and fictitious.  Even the Bankâs demand for reconveyance in
the instant case does not make this case similar to the SEC case.  In the latter case, the Bankâs stockholders
seek reconveyance of the subject property on the ground of nullity of the
contract of sale between the Bank and Tala, while in the instant case, the Bank
does not seek the declaration of nullity of the contract of sale executed
between it and Tala and instead seeks reconveyance as an enforcement of an
alleged implied trust relationship between it and Tala.  The two actions for reconveyance - one based
on nullity of sale and the other on enforcement of an implied trust - are
different.
[49]
 
An action for
reconveyance based on nullity of a contract of sale does not divest the MTC of
jurisdiction over an ejectment suit
[50]

precisely because the causes of action and issues in the two cases are
different.  At any rate, the derivative
suit in the SEC was eventually dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on March 6,
1995.
[51]
  We thus find that petitioner is not guilty
of forum shopping in filing the instant case.


We next deal with the jurisdictional issues.  The Court of Appeals held that the RTC of
Malolos did not err in ruling that the MTC of Malolos did not have jurisdiction
to determine two issues in the present case: (1) jurisdiction to determine the
nature of the contractual relations between the parties, 
i.e
., whether lessor-lessee or trustor-trusee; and (2) jurisdiction
to determine the validity of the 20-year and 11-year contracts.


Anent the first jurisdictional issue, the MTC of Malolos had
jurisdiction to determine the contractual relations between the Bank and Tala
in order to settle the issue of ownership and possession of the subject
property.  The Revised Rules on Summary
Procedure, effective November 15, 1991, prior to the filing of the instant case
in November 1994, provide in Section 1, A(1), 
viz
:


âSection 1. Scope. - This rule shall govern the summary procedure
in the Metropolitan Trial Courts, the Municipal Trial Courts in Cities, the
Municipal Trial Courts, and the Municipal Circuit Trial Courts in the following
cases falling within their jurisdiction:


A.
      
 Civil Cases
:


(1) All cases of
forcible entry and unlawful detainer, irrespective of the amount of damages or
unpaid rentals sought to be recovered.  x x x.â


All ejectment cases are covered by the rules on summary procedure
and are within the jurisdiction of the said inferior courts regardless of
whether they involve questions of ownership.  The courts in ejectment cases may determine questions 
of ownership whenever 
necessary
to decide the question of possession.
[52]


Rep. Act No. 7691, approved on March 25, 1994, amended Section 33
of the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, 
viz
: 


âSec. 33.  Jurisdiction of
Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial
Courts in Civil Cases. - Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and
Municipal Circuit Trial Courts shall exercise:


x x x
                                                                      
x
x x
                                                                             
x
x x


(2) Exclusive original jurisdiction over cases of forcible entry
and unlawful detainer: Provided, That when, in such cases, the defendant raises
the question of ownership in his pleadings and the question of possession
cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of ownership, 
the issue of ownership shall be resolved
only to determine the issue of  possession
 . . .â  (
emphasis supplied
)


The 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure also provide in Section 16, 
viz
:


âSec. 16. Resolving defense of ownership. - When the defendant
raises the defense of ownership in his pleadings and the question of possession
cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of ownership, the issue of
ownership shall be resolved only to determine the issue of possession.â


The pivotal question in the instant case, therefore, is whether
or not it is necessary to settle the question of ownership based on the alleged
âwarehousing agreementâ or trustor-trustee relationship in order to settle the issue
of possession.  The decision of the MTC
of Malolos discussed the validity of the 11-year and the 20-year
contracts.  It noted that the 11-year
contract was spurious and the 20-year contract was genuine and governed the
relationship between Tala and the Bank, but the court did not uphold the
20-year contract nor strike down the 11-year contract for want of
jurisdiction.  The decision also touched
upon the âwarehousingâ circumstances under which the 20-year contract was
executed as described by the Bank, but only in its narration of facts.  It did not discuss, much less rule on, the
validity of the âwarehousing agreement.â  The RTC of Malolos did not also rule upon whether or not the issue of
ownership based on the âwarehousing agreementâ needed to be resolved to
determine the issue of possession.  The
Court of Appeals, however, found that the resolution of the real nature of the
contractual relations between the parties is a prerequisite to determine the
issue of ownership and possession.


We agree with the appellate court that it is necessary to resolve
the real nature of the contractual relations between Tala and the Bank to
determine ownership over the subject property and consequently settle the issue
of who between the Bank or Tala has the right to possess the property.  Talaâs right to lease the property to the
Bank proceeds from its (Talaâs) claim of ownership of the property based on a
contract of sale executed between it and the Bank on August 25, 1981.  The Bank, however, disputes Talaâs ownership
âin fee simpleâ as stated in its 20-year lease contract with Tala as it (the
Bank) alleges that there is an implied trust relationship between the Bank as
trustor and beneficiary and Tala as trustee.  Pursuant to this implied trust, the Bank in April 1994 demanded Tala to
perform its obligation as trustee and return the disputed property to the Bank
as trustor and beneficiary.  The Bank is
of the view, therefore, that since it had already sought enforcement of the implied
trust and reconveyance of the subject property, the Bank had the right to its
possession and Tala did not have a right to eject it from the property.


There is no doubt that the Bank sold the subject property to Tala
on August 25, 1981 and that the latter leased the property to the Bank on the
same day.  The Bank itself admits that
it executed the August 25, 1981 contract of sale over the subject property with
Tala.  Its provisions are clear that the
Bank transferred ownership of the subject property to Tala, 
viz
:


âNOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises
and of the agreed purchase price of Nine Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Pesos
Only (
P
975,000.00), Philippine Currency, which the VENDEE have (
sic
) now paid to the VENDOR and receipt
whereof in full the VENDOR acknowledged and confessed to its entire and
complete satisfaction, the said VENDOR do (
sic
)
hereby SELL, TRANSFER, CEDE, and CONVEY and by these presents have SOLD,
TRANSFERRED, CEDED, and CONVEYED absolutely and perpetually, unto the VENDEE,
its transferee and assigns, all of its above described properties as free from
all liens and encumbrances whatsoever . . .â


With the limitation set by the General
Banking Act on the Bankâs real estate holdings, the Bank did not have a choice
but to transfer ownership of the subject property to Tala.  Hence, in the 20-year lease contract which
the Bank claims is the valid and genuine lease contract, it is stated that Tala
is âthe owner in fee simpleâ of the subject property.


The contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties
unequivocally show that a genuine sale and lease of the Bulacan property were
consummated.  The Bank paid advance
rentals in the amount of 
P
487,500.00 and monthly rentals of 
P
39,200.00
for the first three months of the lease, 
i.e.
,
from September to December 1981, as evidenced by the Bankâs own Exhibit 13, the
official receipt that Tala issued to the Bank for the said amounts.
[53]

The Bank, however, argues that the sale and lease of the property were not
really contemplated by the parties because part of the payment for the purchase
price came from the Bankâs own payment of advance rentals, and the
amortizations of the loan which paid the balance of the purchase price were
paid out of the Bankâs monthly rentals on the property.  In other words, Tala did not really pay for
the purchase price as it did not have to shell out a single centavo under the
arrangement.  Instead, according to the
Bank, the arrangement between Tala and the Bank should be understood as a
âwarehousing agreementâ whereby Tala holds the subject property for the Bank.


The Bankâs argument fails to support its cause.  The application of the advance rentals to
the purchase price and the monthly rentals to the loan amortizations does not
negate, but even bolsters the conclusion that there was a genuine sale and
lease between the Bank and Tala because the arrangement shows that there was in
fact valuable consideration for the sale and lease.  Simply put, Tala truly had to pay the purchase price for the Bank
to sell the subject property to it and the Bank truly had to pay rentals to
Tala for its lease.  It is of no moment
that the purchase price came from the advance and monthly rentals paid by the
Bank itself because these amounts were due to Tala as the lessor.  As such, it could dispose of the money by
applying it to a portion of the purchase price and the amortizations of its
loan that covered the balance of the purchase price.


Having established that there was a genuine sale and lease of the
disputed property, we now determine which of the two lease contracts - the
20-year contract or 11-year contract - is valid and genuine.  Tala claims it is the former while the Bank
asserts that it is the latter.  This
brings us to the other jurisdictional issue of whether or not the MTC of
Malolos had jurisdiction to determine the validity of the lease contracts.  The MTC of Malolos, RTC of Malolos and Court
of Appeals all ruled that the MTC of Malolos did not have jurisdiction to
decide this question of validity as this is an issue incapable of pecuniary
estimation cognizable by the Regional Trial Court.  We find it unnecessary to settle this jurisdictional issue at
this point as this Court has already ruled upon the validity of similar
contracts in several cases between the same parties, involving the same issues
and set of facts and circumstances, with only the property subject of the lease
contracts varying.


Dictated by the doctrine of 
stare
decisis
,
[54]

we adhere to the factual finding of this Court that the 20-year lease contract
governs the relationship between the parties and that the 11-year lease
contract is spurious in the following cases:  
Tala Realty Services Corporation
v. Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank
, G.R. No. 129887, February 17,
2000, penned by Justice Sabino de Leon, Jr.; 
Tala Realty Services Corporation v. Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage
Bank
, G.R. No. 137980, June 20, 2000, penned by Justice Consuelo
Ynares-Santiago; and 
Tala Realty
Services Corporation v. Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank
, G.R. No.
132051, June 25, 2001, penned by Justice Angelina Sandoval-Gutierrez.  Following the 
stare decisis
 doctrine, the last two cases adhered to and quoted
the following conclusion of the first case that the 20-year contract is valid
and the 11-year contract is spurious:


âSecond.  Petitioner Tala
Realty insists that its eleven (11)-year lease contract controls.  We agree with the MTC and the RTC, however,
that the eleven (11)-year contract is a forgery because (1) Teodoro O. Arcenas,
then Executive Vice-President of private respondent Banco Filipino, denied
having signed the contract; (2) the records of the notary public who notarized
the said contract, Atty. Generoso S. Fulgencio, Jr. do not include the said
document; and (3) the said contract was never submitted to the Central Bank as
required by the latterâs rules and regulations (Rollo, pp. 383-384.).


Clearly, the foregoing circumstances are badges of fraud and
simulation that rightly make any court suspicious and wary of imputing any
legitimacy and validity to the said lease contract.


Executive Vice-President Arcenas of private respondent Banco
Filipino testified that he was responsible for the daily operations of said
bank.  He denied having signed the
eleven (11)-year contract and reasoned that it was not in the interest of Banco
Filipino to do so (Rollo, p. 384).  That
fact was corroborated by Josefina C. Salvador, typist of Banco Filipinoâs Legal
Department, who allegedly witnessed the said contract and whose initials
allegedly appear in all the pages thereof.  She disowned the said marginal initials (
Id
., p. 385).


The Executive Judge of the RTC supervises a notary public by
requiring submission to the Office of the Clerk of Court of his monthly
notarial report with copies of acknowledged documents thereto attached.  Under this procedure and requirement of the
Notarial Law, failure to submit such notarial report and copies of acknowledged
documents has dire consequences including the possible revocation of the
notaryâs notarial commission.


The fact that the notary public who notarized petitioner Tala
Realtyâs alleged eleven (11)-year lease contract did not retain a copy thereof
for submission to the Office of the Clerk of Court of the proper RTC militates
against the use of said document as a basis to uphold petitionerâs claim.  The said alleged eleven (11)-year lease
contract was not submitted to the Central Bank whose strict documentation rules
must be complied with by banks to ensure their continued good standing.  On the contrary, what was submitted to the
Central Bank was the twenty-year lease contract.


Granting 
arguendo
 that
private respondent Banco Filipino deliberately omitted to submit the eleven
(11)-year contract to the Central Bank, we do not consider that fact as
violative of the 
res inter alios acta
aliis non nocet
 (Section 28, Rule 130, Revised Rules of Court provides,
viz.: âSec. 28. Admission by third party - The rights of a party cannot be
prejudiced by an act, declaration or omission of another, except as hereinafter
provided;â Compania General de Tabacos v. Ganson, 13 Phil. 472, 477 [1909])
rule in evidence.  Rather, it is an
indication of said contractâs inexistence.


It is not the eleven (11)-year contract but the twenty (20)-year
lease contract which is the real and genuine contract between petitioner Tala
Realty and private respondent Banco Filipino
.  Considering that the twenty (20)-year lease contract is still
subsisting and will expire in 2001 yet, Banco Filipino is entitled to the
possession of the subject premises for as long as it pays the agreed rental and
does not violate the other terms and conditions thereof (Art. 1673, New Civil
Code).â
[55]

(
emphasis supplied
)


In the case at bar, the above-quoted âbadges of fraud and
simulation that rightly make any court suspicious and wary of imputing any
legitimacy and validity to the said lease contractâ are also present.  The MTC of Malolos found that Teodoro
Arcenas, then Executive Vice-President of the Bank at the time the alleged
11-year contract was signed, denied having signed the 11-year contract.
[56]
 
  Josefina G. Corpuz, then clerk typist in the
Bankâs legal department also disowned her alleged marginal initials in every
page of the contract.
[57]
 
  The Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial
Court of Manila certified that the notarized 11-year contract of lease dated
August 26, 1981, allegedly notarized by Rolando C. Salonga, a notary public for
the City of Manila, was never reported to that office by the notary public as
required by law.
[58]

The 11-year lease contract was also not submitted to the Central Bank
.
[59]
 
We find no reason to
depart from the finding in the other cases between Tala and the Bank that the
20-year contract is the real and genuine contract between the parties and the
11-year contract is spurious.


In addition, Tala admits that the nine ejectment cases it filed
against the Bank with respect to the nine properties it leased to the latter,
including the subject property, âinvolve the same parties-litigants and stemmed
from a single chain of events and issues.â  In collecting unpaid rentals from the Bank, Tala itself invokes the
doctrine of 
stare decisis
 in inviting
this Courtâs attention to the decisions in G.R. No. 129887, G.R. No. 137980,
and G.R. No. 132051, all similarly entitled 
Tala Realty Services Corporation v. Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage
Bank,
 holding that âit is the TWENTY (20)-year lease agreement which
governs the relations of the parties.â
[60]


The Bank alleges that the sale and twenty-year lease of the
disputed property were part of a larger implied trust âwarehousing
agreement.â  Concomitant with this
Courtâs factual finding that the 20-year contract governs the relations between
the parties, we find the Bankâs allegation of circumstances surrounding its
execution worthy of credence; the Bank and Tala entered into contracts of sale
and lease back of the disputed property and created an implied trust
âwarehousing agreementâ for the reconveyance of the property.  In the eyes of the law, however, this
implied trust is inexistent and void for being contrary to law.
[61]


A trust is defined as a âfiduciary relationship with respect to
property which involves the existence of equitable duties imposed upon the
holder of the title to the property to deal with it for the benefit of
another.  A person who establishes a
trust is called the trustor; one in whom confidence is reposed as regards
property for the benefit of another is known as the trustee; and the person for
whose benefit the trust has been created is referred to as the beneficiary or 
cestui que trust
.â
[62]
 
  In the instant case, the Bank claims to be
both the trustor and beneficiary while Tala is the trustee.


Trust is either express or implied.  The Bank, in alleging the existence of an implied trust between
it and Tala, relies on Articles 1448 and 1453 of the New Civil Code which
provide:


âArt. 1448.  There is an
implied trust when property is sold, and the legal estate is granted to one
party but the price is paid by another for the purpose of having the beneficial
interest of the property.  The former is
the trustee, while the latter is the beneficiary. . .

Art. 1453. When property is conveyed to a person in reliance upon
his declared intention to hold it for, or transfer it to another or the
grantor, there is an implied trust in favor of the person whose benefit is
contemplated.â
[63]




Implied trusts are either resulting or constructive trusts.  
Morales
v. Court of Appeals
[64]

describes the two, 
viz
:


âResulting trusts are based on the equitable doctrine that valuable
consideration and not legal title determines the equitable title or interest and
are presumed always to have been contemplated by the parties.  They arise from the nature or circumstances
of the consideration involved in a transaction whereby one person thereby
becomes invested with legal title but is obliged in equity to hold his legal
title for the benefit of another.  On
the other hand, constructive trusts are created by the construction of equity
in order to satisfy the demands of justice and prevent unjust enrichment.  They arise contrary to intention against one
who, by fraud, duress or abuse of confidence, obtains or holds the legal right
to property which he ought not, in equity and good conscience, to hold.â
[65]


Both Articles 1448 and 1453 invoked by
the Bank are examples of resulting trusts.
[66]


An implied trust could not have been formed between the Bank and
Tala as this Court has held that âwhere the purchase is made in violation of an
existing statute and in evasion of its express provision, no trust can result
in favor of the party who is guilty of the fraud.â
[67]

In 
Ramos v. Court of Appeals
,
[68]
 
Lydia Celestino was
a Central Bank employee disqualified from owning a lot through the Peopleâs
Homesite & Housing Corporation (PHHC) which awarded rights to buy certain
parcels of land to employees of the Central Bank.  Only those who did not own lots in Quezon City were qualified,
but she already owned a residential lot in Quezon City.  To circumvent her disqualifaction, she
âpurchasedâ a lot from the PHHC through a qualified Central Bank employee.  After Celestino paid the full purchase price
of the PHHC-awarded lot and issues arose regarding the ownership of the
property, Celestino filed an action for reconveyance to enforce the resulting
trust between her and the qualified Central Bank employee based on Article 1448
of the New Civil Code.  The Court ruled
that the alleged resulting trust was void, 
viz
:


âThe inevitable conclusion then is that Lydia Celestino, knowing of
her disqualification to acquire a lot from the PHHC at the subdivision reserved
for qualified Central Bank employees, tried to get one through the
backdoor.  Otherwise stated, she wanted
to get indirectly that which she could not do so directly.  Having acted with evident bad faith, she did
not come to court with clean hands when she asked for the reconveyance of the
property on the basis of a resulting trust under Article 1448 of the Civil
Code.


A resulting trust is an âintent-enforcingâ trust, based on a
finding by the court that in view of the relationship of the parties their acts
express an intent to have a trust, even though they did not use language to
that effect.  The trust is said to
result in law from the acts of the parties.  However, 
if the purpose of the
payor of the consideration in having title placed in the name of another was to
evade some rule of the common or statute law, the courts will not assist the
payor in achieving his improper purpose by enforcing a resultant trust for him
in accordance with the âclean handsâ doctrine.
  The court generally refuses to give aid to claims from rights
arising out of an illegal transaction, such as where the payor could not
lawfully take title to land in his own name and he used the grantee as mere
dummy to hold for him and enable him to evade the land laws. . . (George T.
Bogert, Trusts, sec. 74 [6
th
 ed. 1987]).


Otherwise stated, as an exception to the law on trusts, â[a] trust
or a provision in the terms of a trust is invalid if the enforcement of the
trust or provision would be against public policy, even though its performance
does not involve the commission of a criminal or tortuous act by the trustee.â
(Restatement [Second] of Trusts 62 [1959])  
The parties must necessarily be
subject to the same limitations on allowable stipulations in ordinary
contracts, i.e., their stipulations must not be contrary to law, morals, good
customs, public order, or public policy (Article 1306, Civil Code).
 
What
the parties then cannot expressly provide in their contracts for being contrary
to law and public policy, they cannot impliedly or implicitly do so in the
guise of a resulting trust
.â
[69]
 (
emphasis supplied
)


Applying the 
Ramos 
ruling
to the case at bar, the Bank cannot use the defense of nor seek enforcement of
its alleged implied trust with Tala since its purpose was contrary to law.  As admitted by the Bank, it âwarehousedâ its
branch site holdings to Tala to enable it to pursue its expansion program and
purchase new branch sites including its main branch in Makati, and at the same
time avoid the real property holdings limit under Sections 25(a) and 34 of the
General Banking Act which it had already reached.
[70]

The Bank stated in its Memorandum that âthe (n)ew branch sites which the
Respondent (Bank) will be disqualified from buying, by reason of the aforecited
limitations under existing banking laws and regulations, will be acquired for
it by the Petitioner (Tala) which will forthwith lease them to the Respondent
(Bank).â
[71]
 
The Bank also
admitted that the agreement that the branch sites âwill be returned to the bank
anytime at its pleasure at the same transfer priceâ was differently stated in
the lease contracts as a âfirst preference to buyâ because the Bank was
apprehensive that the agreement to return property, âif spelled out as-is in
the documents, might provide basis for the Central Bank to question the sale
and simultaneous lease back of the branch sites as simulated and accordingly,
derail the expansion program of the Respondent.â
[72]


Clearly, the Bank was well aware of the limitations on its real
estate holdings under the General Banking Act and that its âwarehousing
agreementâ with Tala was a scheme to circumvent the limitation.  Thus, the Bank opted not to put the
agreement in writing and call a spade a spade, but instead phrased its right to
reconveyance of the subject property at any time as a âfirst preference to buyâ
at the âsame transfer price.â  This
arrangement which the Bank claims to be an implied trust is contrary to
law.  Thus, while we find the sale and
lease of the subject property genuine and binding upon the parties, we cannot
enforce the implied trust even assuming the parties intended to create it.  In the words of the Court in the 
Ramos case
, âthe courts will not assist
the payor in achieving his improper purpose by enforcing a resultant trust for
him in accordance with the âclean handsâ doctrine.â
[73]

The Bank cannot thus demand reconveyance of the property based on its alleged
implied trust relationship with Tala.


We now come to the second assignment of error involving the issue
of whether or not sufficient grounds exist to eject the Bank from the leased
premises.  In G.R. No. 137980 and G.R.
No. 132051, this Court ruled that there was a ground for ejectment as the Bank
failed to pay rent, 
viz
:


â
While advance rentals appear to have been made to be applied
for the payment of rentals due from the eleventh year to the twentieth year of
the lease, 
to 
wit
-


â3.  That upon the signing
and execution of this Contract, the LESSEE shall pay the LESSOR ONE MILLION
TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS ONLY (
P
1,020,000.00) Philippine Currency
representing advance rental to be applied on the monthly rental for the period
from the eleventh to the twentieth year.â


the records show that such advance
rental had already been applied for rent on the property for the period of
August, 1985 to November, 1989.


Thus, when respondent stopped paying any rent at all beginning
April, 1994, it gave petitioner good ground for instituting ejectment
proceedings.  We reiterate the ruling in
T & C Development Corporation, 
supra
,
that if ever petitioner took exception to the unilateral or illegal increase in
rental rate, it should not have completely stopped paying rent but should have
deposited the original rent amount with the judicial authorities or in a bank
in the name of, and with notice to, petitioner.  This circumstance, 
i.e.
,
respondentâs failure to pay rent at the old rate, does not appear in G.R. No.
129887.  Thus, while we are bound by the
findings of this Courtâs Second Division in that case under the principle of 
stare decisis
, the fact that
respondentâs failure to pay any rentals beginning April 1994, which provided
ground for its ejectment from the premises, justifies our departure from the
outcome of G.R. No. 129887.  In this
case, we uphold petitionerâs right to eject respondent from the leased
premises.â
[74]

(
emphasis supplied
)


On motion for reconsideration of the decision in G.R. No. 137980,
the Bank insisted that it should be excused from liability as its closure and
consequent lack of access to its funds to pay its obligations, including the
rentals on the leased premises, was a fortuitous event.  In its Resolution,
[75]

the Court ruled on this issue, 
viz
:


âGranting, without conceding, that liability should not lie with
respondent for unpaid rentals on the leased premises while it was under control
of the Central Bank, this matter is not an issue in the instant case, where the
subject matter is merely ejectment.  As
the lessee of the premises, respondent had the exclusive obligation to settle
any unpaid rentals.  Petitioner dealt
directly with respondent, and therefore had the right to enforce the lease
contract against respondent only.  Any
right of action that respondent may have against the Central Bank is a matter
that can be best ventilated in the proper forum.â
[76]


A close scrutiny of the facts of the case at bar compels us to
arrive at a conclusion different from the resolution of the motion for
reconsideration of the decision in G.R. No. 137980.  The question of whether the Bank was liable to pay rents at the
time it was arbitrarily closed by the Central Bank is decisive of the issue of
ejectment on the ground of non-payment of rent.


Equity dictates that Tala should not be allowed to collect rent
from the Bank.  The factual milieu of
the instant case clearly shows that both the Bank and Tala participated in the
deceptive creation of a trust to circumvent the real estate investment limit
under Sections 25(a) and 34 of the General Banking Act.  Upholding Talaâs right to collect rent for
the period during which the Bank was arbitrarily closed would allow Tala to
benefit from the illegal âwarehousing agreement.â  This would result in the application of the Bankâs advance
rentals covering the eleventh to the twentieth years of the lease, to the
rentals due for the period during which the Bank was arbitrarily closed.  With the advance rentals already used up,
and the Bank having stopped payment of rent on the thirteenth year of the lease
or in April 1994, rentals would be due Tala from the time the Bank stopped
paying rent in April 1994 up to the expiration of the lease period.  Just as the Bank should not be allowed to benefit
from its deceptive âwarehousing agreement,â Tala should also not benefit from
the arrangement as it was the Bankâs major stockholders that proposed the
arrangement and incorporated Tala.  Tala
committed deception by participating in the âwarehousing agreement,â and
committed another deception when it turned the tables on the Bank and denied
the arrangement.  Allowing Tala to
further benefit from the âwarehousing agreementâ is unconscionable, to say the
least.


The Bank and Tala are 
in
pari delicto
, thus, no affirmative relief should be given to one against
the other.
[77]

The Bank should not be allowed to dispute the sale of its lands to Tala nor
should Tala be allowed to further collect rent from the Bank.  The clean hands doctrine will not allow the
creation or the use of a juridical relation such as a trust to subvert,
directly or indirectly, the law.
[78]

Neither the Bank nor Tala came to court with clean hands; neither will obtain
relief from the court as one who seeks equity and justice must come to court
with clean hands.
[79]
 By
not allowing Tala to collect from the Bank rent for the period during which the
latter was arbitrarily closed, both Tala and the Bank will be left where they
are, each paying the price for its deception.


I
n hindsight, the
payment of rent on the subject Bulacan property covering the period August 1985
to November 1989 by the Bankâs liquidator and the lawyer of the latter was a
payment by mistake because as a matter of equity, Tala did not have the right
to collect nor did the Bank have the corresponding obligation to pay rent for
the period of its arbitrary closure.  Tala thus holds in trust for the Bank the erroneous payment made by the
Bankâs liquidator pursuant to Article 1456 of the New Civil Code, which
provides:


âArt. 1456. If property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the
person obtaining it is, by force of law, considered a trustee of an implied
trust for the benefit of the person from whom the property comes.â


Consequently, we rule that the advance
rentals paid by the Bank for the period covering the eleventh to the twentieth
year of the 20-year lease contract, 
i.e.
,
from 1992 to 2001, subsist as advance rentals and should not have been applied
to the payment of rentals on the Bulacan property for the period covering
August 1985 to November 1989 during which the Bank was arbitrarily closed.  If at all, Tala should seek remedy for its
loss from the Central Bank which caused the Bankâs arbitrary closure and not
from the Bank which was itself a victim of the arbitrary act of government.


In sum, there is no ground for ejectment in the case at bar at
the time the ejectment suit was instituted in the MTC of Malolos, whether on
the ground of expiration of the lease contract or non-payment of rent.  We note, however, that by this time, the
lease contract over the subject Bulacan property executed between Tala and the
Bank on August 25, 1981, which stipulated a twenty-year lease period beginning
September 1, 1981 already expired in August 2001.  In the absence of renewal or extension of the lease contract,
Tala has the right to eject the Bank from the subject Bulacan property on the
ground of expiration of the contract.
