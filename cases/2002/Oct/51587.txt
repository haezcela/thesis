 NO BAIL RECOMMENDED
 
(SGD.) REGINA COELI F. GABITO
 
 
Prosecutor II 
 
Officer In-Chargeâ
When arraigned on June 8, 2000, the appellant, assisted by counsel 
de oficio
, pled ânot guilty.â
[2]
  However, at the first hearing of the case on January 11, 2001, the appellant, through counsel, withdrew his plea of ânot guiltyâ and changed it to âguilty.â To avoid an improvident plea, the trial court inquired on the voluntariness of his plea, informed him of the meaning of his admission of the crime charged and the penalty for it. The appellant, however, persisted on his plea of guilty,
[3]
 thus, a new Certificate of Arraignment,
[4]
 dated January 11, 2000, was issued. On the same day, the evidence for the prosecution was received. 
 The prosecution evidence shows that the private complainant, Dory Ebio, is the daughter of spouses Cristina Daquio and appellant Gerry Ebio.
[5]
 The private complainant is the third in a brood of six (6) children.
[6]
 She was born on March 24, 1989, as shown in her Certificate of Live Birth.
[7]
 The Ebios are residents of Tughan, Juban, Sorsogon. Their house has one bedroom where Cristina and Gerry sleep, together with private complainantâs youngest sister. The private complainant, her other sisters and their grandmother sleep in the
 sala
. 
 The private complainant testified that in the evening of April 21, 2000, she was preparing to sleep in the 
sala
. Her three (3) younger sisters and their grandmother were also in the
 sala
, sleeping. Her elder sister, Donna, their aunt and their cousin, went to church earlier that night, while her mother, Cristina, was in Manila together with her sister, Dina. The appellant was not yet home at that time. 
 The appellant arrived in their house at about 10:00 p.m. He proceeded to the room and fixed the bed. Thereafter, he approached the private complainant and told her to transfer to the bedroom because they were already crowded in the
 sala
. She obeyed him because she was afraid he would scold her. The appellant was drunk. 
 Armed with a six-inch long bladed instrument, the appellant ordered her to undress and threatened to kill her if she would not comply. Afraid of the threat, she took off her shorts and panty. Appellant also took off his shorts, mounted her and had carnal knowledge of her. She felt pain and cried. The private complainant was silent during the sexual assault because he threatened to kill her if she would talk or shout. After the assault, she put on her shorts and panty and again lay down. She remained inside the room, crying.
The following day, April 22, the private complainant reported the incident to her grandmother. Her grandmother accompanied her to the police authorities. She executed a sworn statement
[8]
 and a written complaint,
[9]
 both dated April 27, 2000, charging the appellant with rape.
 The private complainant revealed that the April 21, 2000 incident was the third occasion that she was raped by the appellant. The first two (2) defilements happened when she was ten (10) years old. She was then a Grade II elementary pupil. She related the incidents to her mother who told her that they would file a complaint against the appellant. However, they were not able to report the matter to the police.
 The private complainant was brought to Dr. Erlinda B. Olondriz-Orense, Municipal Health Officer of Sorsogon, for medical examination. The lady doctorâs findings are as follows:
[10]
 
 âTo Whom It May Concern:  
 This is to certify that I have examined Dory Ebio, 11 years old, resident of Tughan, Juban, Sorsogon.  
 Findings:  
 -
 labia majora 
and
 minora
 in close contact  
- Internal exam. - vaginal wall admits one finger with resistance  
- With healed hymenal lacerations at 4 oâclock and 6 oâclock (positions)                            
 
ERLINDA B. OLONDRIZ-ORENSE, M.D.,CFP 
 
Municipal Health Officer
 
 
Juban, Sorsogonâ
Leonisa Ebio
, 12 years old, cousin of the private complainant, lives with the Ebios in Tughan, Juban, Sorsogon. She testified that in the evening of April 21, 2000, after going to church, she returned to the house of the Ebios to sleep. She was about to sleep when she heard someone crying inside the room of her 
Tiyo
 Gerry, the appellant, and 
Tiya
 Cristy. Curious, she slowly entered the room. She saw the appellant on top of the private complainant. Both were naked and the appellant was raping the private complainant. Afraid that the appellant might kill her, she retreated and went back to sleep. She did not relate the incident to anyone out of fear.  
 
Cristina Ebio
 testified that she is legally married to the appellant. The victim is their daughter. Dory was born on March 24, 1989. On April 27, 2000, she (Cristina) was in Manila for a medical check-up. She received a phone call from a relative, informing her that the appellant had raped their daughter. She cried and immediately headed back to Sorsogon. 
 Upon reaching their town, she proceeded to the municipal building where she found the private complainant. They both cried when they met. The private complainant told her about the April 21, 2000 rape incident.
 Cristina claimed that she confronted the appellant about the rape committed on April 21, 2000. He admitted the dastardly act and explained that he was drunk at the time.
 After the prosecution had rested its case, the defense opted not to present any evidence. Hence, the case was deemed submitted for decision.
 On February 19, 2001, the trial court rendered its judgment, finding the appellant guilty of qualified rape. The appellant was sentenced to suffer the penalty of death and ordered to pay the private complainant the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages. The dispositive portion of the decision
[11]
 reads:  
 âIn view of the foregoing, the Court finds the accused Gerry Ebio y Hermida 
GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of RAPE 
under R.A. 7610 as amended by R.A. 7659 and further amended by R.A. 8353, otherwise known as the ANTI-RAPE LAW of 1997, and accordingly sentences him with the penalty of 
DEATH under Art. 266-8 of R.A. 8353
; and to pay the victim civil indemnity of P75,000,00 and moral damages of P50,000,00.  
 Considering however the open repentance of the accused in Court in accepting the crime he has done, this Court is recommending to Her Excellency, the President of the Republic of the Philippines, thru the Department of Justice, an EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY as the penalty imposed to (sic) the accused is to the Court excessive if we are to administer justice in a manner that is fair and just but compassionate and merciful as well.
 SO ORDERED.  
 Given this 19th day of February 2001 at Sorsogon, Sorsogon, Philippines.                    
 
(SGD.) JOSE L. MADRID 
 
Judgeâ
Hence, the automatic review of the case.  
 The Appellantâs Brief assigns a single error:  
 âTHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED ON (
sic
) CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE HIS IMPROVIDENT PLEA OF GUILTY.â
 We affirm the judgment of conviction.
 Appellant contends that his plea of guilty was improvident because the trial court did not strictly observe Section 3, Rule 116 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. The rule provides that when an accused pleads guilty to a capital offense, the courts should perform the following tasks: (1) it shall conduct a 
searching inquiry into
 the 
voluntariness
  and
 full comprehension
 of the consequences of his plea, and (2) it shall require the prosecution to prove his guilt and the precise degree of culpability. Thereafter, the trial court will allow the accused to present evidence, if he so desires. 
 It is alleged that the appellant did not fully understand the consequences of his plea because when the appellant was re-arraigned on January 11, 2001, the trial court told the appellant that he would be sentenced to â
reclusion perpetua
 to death
â if he pled guilty. Allegedly, the penalty could not have been understood by the appellant. 
 Appellant is clutching on straws. He was convicted on the basis of the evidence presented by the prosecution and not on his guilty plea. The private complainant testified as follows:

A:

Court: 
 
Q:
What did you feel? 
A:

Prosecutor Bonto:
 
Q:
Now, Dory, when your father was abusing you, what did you do? 
A:
I remained silent. 
 
 
Q:
 Why did you remain silent?
A:
 
 Because according to my father if I will talk or shout, I will be killed by him.
 
Q:
 But you (did) not cry when you felt pain?
A:
 
 I cried.

A:
Inside the room. 
 
Q:
Did you not leave the room of your father?
A:
 
No, sir, but I was crying.â
It is highly improbable for a daughter to go out in public to falsely accuse her father of rape if it were not true. It is against human nature for a girl to fabricate a story that would expose herself as well as her family to a lifetime of dishonor, especially when her charge could mean the death of her own father.

 Leonisa Ebio corroborated Doryâs story of defilement. Leonisa testified as follows:

Prosecutor Bonto: 
 
For the record, Your Honor please, the witness is starting to cry...â
The rape is also supported by the medical findings of Dr. Olondriz-Orense. The lady doctor revealed that the hymen of the private complainant has healed lacerations at 4 oâclock and 6 oâclock positions. She explained that the lacerations could have been inflicted 5 or 6 days before the examination on April 27, 2000. Her opinion is consistent with the private complainantâs claim that she was raped on the 21st of that month.
[15]
 We now review the penalty imposed.
 Section 8, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure states that âthe complaint or information 
shall 
state the designation of the offense given by the statute, 
aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense
, and 
specify
 its 
qualifying
  and
 aggravating circumstances
. If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.â 
 The first qualifying circumstance is the age of the victim.
The Information alleged that the private complainant was only 11 years old at the time she was raped. The prosecution submitted as proof of her age the following evidence: (1) the private complainantâs birth certificate, marked as Exh. âB,â and (2) her testimony that she was born on March 24, 1989, duly corroborated by her mother, Cristina Ebio. No contrary evidence was submitted by the appellant. Needless to state, the age of the private complainant was proved beyond reasonable doubt.
Similarly, the relationship of the offender to the victim was also duly established. The marriage of the appellant with Cristina Ebio in 1985 is evidenced by their Marriage Contract.
[16]
 They had six (6) children, all girls. The victim is their third child.
 The private complainantâs minority and her relationship to the appellant having been duly alleged and proven, the death penalty was correctly meted by the trial court.
As regards the damages, in addition to the civil indemnity and moral damages awarded to the victim, exemplary damages should be awarded to deter fathers with perverse tendencies and aberrant sexual behavior from sexually abusing their daughters.
[17]
IN VIEW WHEREOF
, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Sorsogon, Branch 51, in Criminal Case No. 2000-5132, finding the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified rape under Republic Act No. 8353, otherwise known as the Anti-Rape Law of 1997, and sentencing him to suffer the Death
[18]
  Penalty, is AFFIRMED. The civil indemnity and moral damages awarded to the victim in the amounts of P75,000.00 and P50,000.00, respectively, are also AFFIRMED. In addition, the appellant is ordered to pay the victim the sum of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages. 
 In accordance with Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659, upon finality of this decision, let the records of this case be forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of executive clemency.
