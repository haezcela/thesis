QUISUMBING, J.:


 These two petitions stem from the decision
[1]
 dated September 23, 1996 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Branch 20, in Civil Case No. CEB-16765.  The first
[2]
 seeks the reversal of the Court of Appealsâ decision dated March 21, 1997, setting aside the orders dated October 1 and November 22, 1996 of the Regional Trial Court. The second
[3]
 prays for the reversal of the resolution dated February 10, 1998, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. CV-56265, denying the motion to dismiss.
The antecedent facts, as gathered from the partiesâ pleadings, are as follows:
On September 23, 1996, the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Branch 20, decided Civil Case No. CEB-16765, decreeing among others the legal separation between petitioner Aida BaÃ±ez and respondent Gabriel BaÃ±ez on the ground of the latterâs sexual infidelity; the dissolution of their conjugal property relations and the division of the net conjugal assets; the forfeiture of respondentâs one-half share in the net conjugal assets in favor of the common children; the payment to petitionerâs counsel of the sum of P100,000 as attorneyâs fees to be taken from petitionerâs share in the net  assets; and the surrender by respondent of the use and possession of a Mazda motor vehicle and the smaller residential house located at Maria Luisa Estate Park Subdivision to petitioner and the common children within 15 days from receipt of the decision.
Thereafter, petitioner filed an urgent 
ex-parte
 motion to modify said decision, while respondent filed a Notice of Appeal.
The trial court granted petitioner Aida Banezâ urgent 
ex-parte
 motion to modify the decision on October 1, 1996 by approving the Commitment of Fees dated December 22, 1994; obliging petitioner to pay as attorneyâs fees the equivalent of 5% of the total value of respondentâs ideal share in the net conjugal assets; and ordering the administrator to pay petitionerâs counsel, Atty. Adelino B. Sitoy, the sum of P100,000 as advance attorneyâs fees chargeable against the aforecited 5%.
[4]
In another motion to modify the decision, petitioner Aida BaÃ±ez sought moral and exemplary damages, as well as litigation expenses.  On October 9, 1996, she filed a motion for execution pending appeal. Respondent Gabriel BaÃ±ez filed a consolidated written opposition to the two motions, and also prayed for the reconsideration of the October 1, 1996 order.
On November 22, 1996, the trial court denied Aidaâs motion for moral and exemplary damages and litigation expenses but gave due course to the execution pending appeal. Thus:
WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing premises, the petitionerâs motion to modify decision is hereby ordered denied. But, petitionerâs motion for execution of decision pending appeal is hereby granted. Consequently, let a writ of execution be issued in this case to enforce the decision for (1) respondent to vacate the premises of the small residential house situated in Maria Luisa Estate Park Subdivision, Lahug, Cebu City and for (2) respondent to surrender the use and possession of said Mazda motor vehicle together with its keys and accessories thereof to petitioner.
Atty. Edgar Gica, the Special Administrator, appointed in this case, is hereby ordered to make the necessary computation of the value of the one-half (1/2) share of petitioner in the net remaining conjugal assets of the spouses within 10 days from receipt of this order.
The petitioner is hereby ordered to post a bond in the amount of P1,500,000.00 to answer for all the damages that respondent may suffer arising from the issuance of said writ of execution pending appeal and to further answer for all the advances that petitioner may have received from the Special Administrator in this case pending final termination of this present case.
[5]
In turn, in a petition for certiorari, Gabriel BaÃ±ez elevated the case to the Court of Appeals. On March 21, 1997, the appellate court rendered its decision, thus:
WHEREFORE, the Order dated October 1, 1996 and the Omnibus Order dated November 22, 1996, insofar as (1) it authorized the release of the sum of P100,000.00 to private respondentâs counsel as the advanced share of private respondent [Aida BaÃ±ez] in the net remaining conjugal assets, and (2) granted the motion for execution pending appeal by ordering petitioner [Gabriel BaÃ±ez] to vacate the premises of the small residential house situated in Maria Luisa Estate Park Subdivision, Lahug, Cebu City, and to surrender the use and possession of the Mazda Motor vehicle to private respondent are hereby SET ASIDE. The writ of execution dated December 2, 1996 and the Order dated December 10, 1996 granting the motion filed by the sheriff to make symbolic delivery of the subject house and motor vehicle to the administrator of the partnership are also SET ASIDE.
As prayed for by petitioner, the Administrator of the conjugal partnership is hereby ordered to cause the reimbursement by counsel for the private respondent [Aida BaÃ±ez] of the amount of P100,000.00 released to him as advance payment of attorneyâs fees.
SO ORDERED.
[6]
On February 10, 1998, the Court of Appeals denied Aidaâs motion for reconsideration. Hence, the petition in G.R. No. 132592, filed by herein petitioner.
In the meantime, the trial court gave due course to Gabrielâs Notice of Appeal and elevated on April 15, 1997 the entire case records to the Court of Appeals.  Aida filed with the Court of Appeals a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that Gabriel had failed to file with the appellate court a Record on Appeal. On February 10, 1998, the Court of Appeals decided the motion, thus:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petitionerâappellantâs motion to dismiss filed on November 3, 1997 is hereby DENIED. The appointment of the petitioner-appellee as administratix of the conjugal properties is hereby AFFIRMED.
In view of petitionerâs Motion to Withdraw her own appeal filed on November 27, 1997, and for failing to pay the required docket fee within the prescribed period under Rule 41, Section 4 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the appeal instituted by the petitioner Aida P. BaÃ±ez is hereby DISMISSED.
In continuance of the appeal of respondent-appellant [Gabriel BaÃ±ez], he is hereby ordered to file his brief with the court within 45 days from receipt of this resolution. The petitioner-appellee [Aida BaÃ±ez] shall file her own brief with the court within 45 days from receipt of the petitioner-appellantâs [Gabriel BaÃ±ez] brief.
SO ORDERED.
[7]
The appellate court also denied herein petitionerâs motion for reconsideration, hence, the petition in G.R. No. 133628.
On January 19, 2000, we consolidated the two petitions. Petitioner Aida BaÃ±ez now avers that the Court of Appeals erred:
I. G.R. No. 132592
...  IN SETTING ASIDE THE GRANT OF EXECUTION PENDING APPEAL BY THE TRIAL COURT OF THE PORTIONS OF ITS DECISION ORDERING RESPONDENT TO VACATE THE SMALLER RESIDENTIAL HOUSE LOCATED AT THE MARIA LUISA ESTATE PARK SUBDIVISION, CEBU CITY, AND TO PAY P100,000.00 TO PETITIONERâS COUNSEL AS ATTORNEYâS FEES TO BE TAKEN FROM HER SHARE IN THE NET CONJUGAL ASSETS.
[8]
II. G.R. No. 133628:
... IN NOT GRANTING PETITIONERâS MOTION TO DISMISS RESPONDENTâS ORDINARY APPEAL AND/OR NOT RETURNING THE RECORDS OF CIVIL CASE NO. CEB-16765 TO THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF CEBU.
[9]
In 
G.R. No. 132592,
 petitioner manifested that she no longer questions the Court of Appealsâ decision on the Mazda vehicle because respondent repossessed it. As to the residential house, she claimed that being conjugal in nature, justice requires that she and her children be allowed to occupy and enjoy the house considering that during the entire proceedings before the trial court, she did not have the chance to occupy it. Further, she posted a bond of P1,500,000 for the damages which respondent may suffer.
[10]
 For these reasons, she asked for execution pending appeal. The amount of P100,000 as advance payment to her counsel was a âdrop in the bucketâ compared to the bond she posted, according to her.  She also suggested as an alternative that she simply be required to put up an additional bond.  She also agreed to submit to an accounting as regular administratrix and the advance attorneyâs fees be charged to her share in the net conjugal assets.
In his comment, respondent denied petitionerâs allegation that she did not have the chance to occupy the residential house. He averred that she could have, had she chosen to. According to him, as the inventory of the coupleâs properties showed, petitioner owned two houses and lots and two motor vehicles in the United States, where she is a permanent resident. Respondent contended that there was no compelling reason for petitioner to have the judgment executed pending appeal.
Essentially, the core issue in G.R. No. 132592 is whether execution of judgment pending appeal was justified.
As held in 
Echaus vs. Court of Appeals
, 199 SCRA 381, 386 (1991), execution pending appeal is allowed when superior circumstances demanding urgency outweigh the damages that may result from the issuance of the writ. Otherwise, instead of being an instrument of solicitude and justice, the writ may well become a tool of oppression and inequity.
[11]
In this case, considering the reasons cited by petitioner, we are of the view that there is no superior or urgent circumstance that outweighs the damage which respondent would suffer if he were ordered to vacate the house. We note that petitioner did not refute respondentâs allegations that she did not intend to use said house, and that she has two (2) other houses in the United States where she is a permanent resident, while he had none at all.  Merely putting up a bond is not sufficient reason to justify her plea for execution pending appeal.  To do so would make execution routinary, the rule rather than the exception.
[12]
Similarly, we are not persuaded that the P100,000 advance payment to petitionerâs counsel was properly granted.  We see no justification to pre-empt the judgment by the Court of Appeals concerning said amount of P100,000 at the time that the trial courtâs judgment was already on appeal.
In 
G.R. No. 133628
, petitioner Aida BaÃ±ez contends that an action for legal separation is among the cases where multiple appeals may be taken.  According to her, the filing of a record on appeal, pursuant to Section 2(a), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court,
[13]
 is required in this case.  She concludes that respondentâs appeal should have been dismissed for his failure to file the record on appeal within the reglementary period, as provided under Section 1-b, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court.
[14]
Petitioner likewise prays that, in the event that we do not dismiss Gabriel BaÃ±ezâ appeal, we should direct the appellate court to return the records of the case to the RTC of Cebu.  Thereafter, according to her, respondent should file his record on appeal for approval and transmittal to the Court of Appeals.  In the alternative, she prays that the appellate court retain only the pleadings and evidence necessary to resolve respondentâs appeal pursuant to Section 6, Rule 44
[15]
 and Section 6, Rule 135
[16]
 of the Rules of Court, and return the rest of the case records to the RTC.
In turn, respondent argues that Section 39 of B.P. 129
[17]
 expressly abolished the requirement of a record on appeal, except in appeals in special proceedings in accordance with Rule 109,
[18]
 and other cases wherein multiple appeals are allowed. An action for legal separation, he avers, is neither a special proceeding nor one where multiple appeals are allowed.
Now, is an action for legal separation one where multiple appeals are allowed?  We do not think so.
In 
Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila v. Court of Appeals
, 258 SCRA 186, 194 (1996), this Court held:
xxx Multiple appeals are allowed in special proceedings, in actions for recovery of property with accounting, in actions for partition of property with accounting, in the special civil actions of eminent domain and foreclosure of mortgage.  The rationale behind allowing more than one appeal in the same case is to enable the rest of the case to proceed in the event that a separate and distinct issue is resolved by the court and held to be final.
In said case, the two issues raised by therein petitioner that may allegedly be the subject of multiple appeals arose from the same cause of action, and the subject matter pertains to the same lessor-lessee relationship between the parties.  Hence, splitting the appeals in that case would only be violative of the rule against multiplicity of appeals.
The same holds true in an action for legal separation.  The issues involved in the case will necessarily relate to the same marital relationship between the parties.  The effects of legal separation, such as entitlement to live separately, dissolution and liquidation of the absolute community or conjugal partnership, and custody of the minor children, follow from the decree of legal separation.
[19]
 They are not separate or distinct matters that may be resolved by the court and become final prior to or apart from the decree of legal separation.  Rather, they are mere incidents of legal separation.
[20]
 Thus, they may not be subject to multiple appeals.
Petitionerâs alternative prayers that in case we do not dismiss the appeal, we return the records to the trial court and require respondent to file a record on appeal, or we return the records to the trial court and retain only the pleadings and orders relevant to the appeal, are untenable. If we grant the first, we are effectively saying that the instant case is one involving multiple appeals, which it is not. If we allow the second, we are effectively applying by analogy, Section 6, Rule 44 and Section 6, Rule 135 of the Rules of Court, without petitioner showing support therefor in law or jurisprudence.
[21]
WHEREFORE,
 the instant petitions are 
DENIED
 for lack of merit. The decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 42663 and CA-G.R. No. CV-56265, respectively, are hereby 
AFFIRMED
, so that the Order dated October 1, 1996, of the Regional Trial Court authorizing the release of P100,000 to petitionerâs counsel; the Omnibus Order dated November 22, 1996 granting the motion pending appeal; the writ of execution dated December 2, 1996; and the Order dated December 10, 1996 granting the motion by the sheriff to make symbolic delivery of the house and vehicle are 
SET ASIDE
.  Further, the Administrator of the conjugal partnership is 
ORDERED
 to cause the reimbursement by petitionerâs counsel of the released amount of P100,000. The Court of Appeals is hereby 
DIRECTED
 to give due course to respondentâs appeal, and the Division Clerk of Court of this Court is likewise 
DIRECTED
 to promptly remand the record of these cases to the Court of Appeals.
Costs against petitioner.
SO ORDERED.
