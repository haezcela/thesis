DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES (DBP), COMPLAINANT, VS. RUBEN S. NEQUINTO, SHERIFF IV, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 145, MAKATI CITY, RESPONDENT.
R E S O L U T I O N




PER CURIAM:


 
At the grassroots of our judicial machinery, sheriffs and deputy sheriffs are indispensably in close contact with the litigants, hence, their conduct should be geared towards maintaining the prestige and integrity of the court, for the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the judge to the least and lowest of its personnel; hence, it becomes the imperative sacred duty of each and everyone in the court to maintain its good name and standing as a temple of justice.
[1]
The Case
Before the Court is an administrative complaint filed by the Development Bank of the Philippines (hereafter, DBP) against Sheriff Ruben S. Nequinto (hereafter, Sheriff Nequinto), Sheriff IV Regional Trial Court, Makati, Branch 145 for (a) dereliction of duty and violation of Administrative Circular No. 12 (Acting as special sheriff for a party litigant) in connection with the implementation of the writ of execution (pending appeal); (b) violation of the clear provisions of Sec. 9, Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure; (c) knowingly violating Sec. 14, Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil procedure; (d) grave abuse of authority; and (e) conduct prejudicial to the interests of the government and/or a government financial institution.
The Facts
On June 14, 1993, the Court appointed respondent Ruben S. Nequinto, Regional Trial Court Deputy Sheriff, Regional Trial Court, Branch CXLV, Makati (now Sheriff IV, Regional Trial Court, Makati, Branch 145) an to this date has been with the Court for twenty-four (24) years.
[2]
On October 17, 1996, FPHC filed with the Regional Trial Court, Makati, Branch 147
[3]
 a case for collection of sum of money
[4]
 against DBP.
On August 8, 1997, the trial court rendered a summary judgment against DBP.  The dispositive portion of the decision reads:
âWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court finding merit in the motion for summary judgment, hereby renders judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against defendant, ordering the latter to pay the former:
â1. the sum of P19,998,400 as unpaid rentals inclusive of interest as 12% per annum as of 31 March 1995, plus interest at 12% per annum on the amount of P9,999,200 after 31 March 1995 until full payment of the principal;
â2. attorneyâs fees equivalent to 20% of the amount claimed in the preceding paragraph;
â3. the costs.
âSO ORDERED.â
On September 3, 1997, FPHC filed with the trial court a motion for execution pending appeal; DBP filed a motion for reconsideration of the trial courtâs decision.
[5]
On November 24, 1997, the trial court granted FPHCâs motion for execution pending appeal, thus:
[6]
âWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court, finding the âMotion For Execution Pending Appealâ to be well-taken, hereby grants the same.  Let a writ of execution issue accordingly upon the filing of a bond in the amount of P30 million, subject to the approval of the court.
âSO ORDERED.â
On November 25,1997, FPHC filed an 
ex-parte
 motion for appointment of special sheriff with the trial court, praying that Sheriff Nequinto of Branch 145 be appointed to implement the writ of execution.
[7]
On November 25, 1997, the trial court designated Sheriff Nequinto as special sheriff to implement the writ of execution as the regular deputy sheriff of Branch 147 was in Isabela.
[8]
 Accordingly, the trial court issued a writ of execution directed to Sheriff Nequinto.  We quote the writ:
[9]
âTO:  Special Sheriff RUBEN S. NEQUINTO
Regional Trial Court
Makati City
âGREETINGS:
âWE COMMAND YOU that of the goods and chattels of DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES with address at DBP Building, Makati Avenue corner Sen. Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City, Metro Manila, you cause to be made the following:
 
 
â1) 
 
the sum of P19,998,400 as unpaid rentals inclusive of interest at 12% per annum as of 31 March 1995, plus interest at 12% per annum on the amount of P9,999,200 after 31 March 1995 until full payment of the principal;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
â2)
 
 
attorneyâs fees equivalent to 20% of the amount claimed in the preceding paragraph;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
â3)
 
 
the costs.
 
 
âtogether with your lawful fees for service of this execution all in money of the Philippines which plaintiff recovered in this Court on August 18, 1997 against the defendant and that you tender the same to said plaintiff aside from your own fees on this execution, and to like-wise return this writ into this Court Immediately thereafter with you proceedings indorsed thereon.
âBut if sufficient personal property cannot be found whereof to satisfy this execution an lawful fees thereon, then you are commanded that of the lands and buildings of defendant you cause to be made the sums of money in the manner required buy law and the Rules of Court, and to make return of your proceedings with this Writ immediately thereafter.
We quote the Court Administratorâs narration of how respondent Sheriff implemented the writ:
[10]
âOn November 26, 1997, respondent Sheriff accompanied by FPHCâs counsel, Atty. Fernando F. Manas, Jr., and FPHCâs representatives Atty. Pedro Malabanan an Anthony Jay B. Consunji, proceeded to the DBP Head Office building at Sen. Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City.
âAfter gaining entry into DBPâs premises, respondent went to the Cash Management Department and announced his threat to 
seal
 the Banksâ vault and to levy DBPâs 
computers
 and 
office equipment
 if his demand for payment is not complied with.  Respondents Sheriff told Bank officials that the amount to be executed against DBP is 
P46,310,684.94
 which amount greatly 
exceeds
 the 
one stated
 in the Writ of Execution.
âThe lawyers of the Bank requested the respondent to give them time to verify the Writ of Execution in his possession.  The respondent sheriff was also informed that DBP had not yet received any copy of the Order granting FPHCâs motion for execution pending appeal.  They also called the Sheriffâs attention to the fact that the amount sought to be enforced (P46,310,684.93)
[11]
 does not correspond to the amount indicated in the writ.  Respondent was also shown a copy of DBPâs own computation of the amount taking into account the interests and costs.
[12]
 Moreover, respondent was advised that his manner of enforcing the writ (sealing the Bankâs vault) will disrupt, if not paralyze the bankâs and its branchesâ operations.  However, despite the Bankâs objections, respondent insisted on sealing the bankâs vault if he is not paid in cash and threatened to forcibly seize any money he may possibly retrieve from the tellerâs cages.  Because of the respondentâs adamant insistence to seal the Bankâs vault, the Bank was constrained, under protest, to issue a Managerâs Check for P10 Million to respondent
[13]
 and offered to the respondent its property covered by TCT No. 196837 located in Sta. Cruz, Manila which has an appraised value of P18,387,900.00 to be levied upon, pursuant to Section 9, Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.  Respondent refused to accept the offer and insisted that he be paid in cash.
âIn spite of the said payment and offer of real property for levy, respondent issued a ânotice of Levy or Sale on Executionâ
[14]
 wherein he made it appear that he was levying on certain personal properties of DBP which he 
did not specifically describe
 but generally referred to as : âfifteen (15) units Personal computers 386 MITAC, Samsung; One Hundred (100) units office tables with chairs.â  Unknown to the complainant respondent also served notices of garnishment of DBPâs deposits with the Land Bank of the Philippines and the PCI Bank.
âIn view of respondentâs unjustified rejection of DBPâs offer and patently abusive manner in implementing the writ, complainant bank filed a âMotion for Approval of Supersedeas Bond an for Holding in Abeyance the Implementation of the Writ of Execution and Sale on Executionâ
[15]
 calling the attention of the Judge to the irregularities in the proceedings of respondent.  Respondent sheriff, on December 2, 1997, proceeded to bankâs head office for the purpose of conducting the âsaleâ of the alleged âlevied propertiesâ despite knowledge of DBPâs Motion and the fact that respondent was served with a letter from he Bankâs Chief Legal Counsel interposing vigorous objection to the scheduled sale on execution.
[16]
âIn his âsheriffâs Report on Executionâ dated 3 December 1997 respondent falsely made it appear that he was prevented from entering the building of DBP.
[17]
 In the same Report, respondent 
willfully and deliberately
 concealed the fact that the bank had issued a P10 Million check to him, that it had offered for levy its real property valued at P18 Million and that he issued Writs of Garnishments involving DBPâs deposits with the Land Bank of the Philippines and other banks.â
On January 27, 1998, DBP through its Chief Legal Counsel, Atty. Carlos R. Cruz filed with the Office of the Court Administrator, Supreme Court (hereafter, OCA) an administrative complaint against Sheriff Nequinto praying that he be disciplinarily dealt with.
[18]
On March 31, 1998, the Court Administrator required respondent sheriff Nequinto to answer the above mentioned complaint within ten (10) days from notice.  On May 14, 1998, respondent sheriff submitted his answer to the complaint.  He admitted that he âthreaten (
sic
) to seal the banksâ vault but such thing is impossible.â  He also admitted that he levied on fifteen (15) units personal computers, 386 MITAC, Samsung, one hundred(100) units office tables with chairs and scheduled the sale on December 2, 1997, without even posting notices nor posted sheriffâs guard at the DBP building.  On December 2, 1997, respondent sheriff tried to enforce the notice of levy on execution at the DBP building but he was not let-in and was even pushed out of the building.
[19]
On February 7, 2000, the OCA submitted its report and recommendation.
[20]
On March 1, 2000, the Court resolved to docket the case as  a regular administrative proceeding and required the parties to manifest whether they were willing to submit the case for resolution on the basis of the pleadings within ten (10) days from notice hereof.
[21]
On April 3, 2000, DBP manifested its willingness to submit the case for resolution on the basis of its sworn letter-complaint dated January 23, 1998.
[22]
On July 17, 2000, the Court required Sheriff Nequinto to show cause why he should not be disciplinary dealt with or punished for contempt or failure to comply with the resolution of March 1, 2000,
[23]
 The Court gave respondent Sheriff Nequinto a period of ten days from receipt of the resolution to comply.
[24]
Still respondent Sheriff Nequinto failed to comply with the above resolution.
[25]
On February 26, 2001, the court reiterated its resolution of July 17, 2000, giving respondent Sheriff Nequinto ten (10) days from receipt of the resolution to comply.
[26]
To date, Sheriff Nequinto has not complied with the Courtâs three resolutions.
[27]
 Hence, we declare the case submitted for resolution.
The Courtâs Ruling
We resolve to dismiss respondent Sheriff Nequinto from the service.  He deliberately failed to follow the procedure on how to execute a money judgment prescribed in the Revised Rules of Court.  Rule 39, Section 9, provides:
âSec. 9 Execution of judgments for money, how enforced â (1) Immediate payment on demand â The officer shall enforce and execution of a judgment for money by demanding from the judgment obligor the immediate payment 
of the full amount stated in the writ of execution and all lawful fees.
  The judgment obligor shall pay in cash, certified bank check payable to the judgment obligee, or any other form of payment acceptable to the latter, the amount of judgment debt under proper receipt directly to the judgment obligee or his authorized representative if present at the time of payment.  The lawful fees shall be handed under proper receipt to the executing sheriff who shall turn over the said amount within the same day to the clerk of court of the court that issued the writ (
underscoring ours
)â
Rule 39, Section 14, further provides:
âSection 14 Return of writ of execution - The writ of execution shall be returnable to the court issuing it immediately after the judgment has been satisfied in part or in full.  If the judgment cannot be satisfied in full within thirty (30) days after his receipt of the writ, the officer shall report to the court and state the reason therefore.  Such writ shall continue in effect during the period within which the judgment may be enforced by motion.  The officer shall make a report to the court every thirty (30) days on the proceedings taken thereon until the judgment is satisfied in full, or its effectivity expires.  The returns or periodic reports shall set forth the whole proceedings taken, and shall be filed with the court and copies thereof promptly furnished the parties.â
Respondent Sheriff Nequinto also denied DBP its option to choose which of its property may be levied upon, as provided for in Section 9 (b), Rule 39, Revised Rules of Court.
Sheriffs play an important role in the administration of justice.  As agents of the law, they are called upon to discharge their duties with due care and utmost diligence because in serving the courtâs writs and processes and implementing its orders, they can not afford to err without affecting the integrity of their office and the efficient administration of justice.
[28]
As an officer of the court, Sheriff Nequinto was obliged to conduct himself with propriety and restraint.  He cannot make use of his public office to oppress or abuse a party especially a sensitive financial institution like the DBP.  His conduct showed unjustified braggadocio.  He did not comply with the set procedure in the rules.  We quote the OCAâs evaluation with respect to this matter:
[29]
âHowever, with regard to the failure of respondent to abide diligently with Sec. 6, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court which provides that:
âSEC. 6 Officerâs return â Immediately after executing the order the officer must make a return thereon to the clerk of judge of the court from which the order issued, 
with a full statement of his proceedings
 under the order and a complete inventory of the property attached, together with any counter-bond given by the party against whom the attachment is issued, and serve a copy of any such counter-bond on the applicant or his lawyerâ.
â
Respondent therefore could not be unaware of such basic rule to evade his positive duty
.  Crystal clear in the Sheriffâs Return dated 03 December 1997 is the fact that respondent omitted to mention what transpired on 26 November 1997 when DBP tendered the P10 million check.  We are inclined to believe then that 
respondent intentionally and deliberately made the questioned omission
 considering that the amount involved is quite impossible to be overlooked.  Moreover, nowhere can we find in respondentâs explanation the reason why he tried to conceal the said misdeed so as to refute the charges made in the complaint.  His nonfeasance may only mean that 
he was trying to mislead the court and herein complainant
 (DBP).  (
underscoring ours
)â
Neither did Sheriff Nequinto mention that DBP offered its real property valued at P18 Million for levy.  We find abusive and without legal basis his insistence on enforcing FPHCâs bloated computation of P46,310,684.93, as the judgment debt, instead of the amount of P19,998,400.00 stated in the writ.
For reasons only known to him, respondent Sheriff Nequinto was overzealous in implementing the writ of execution against DBP, a government financial institution impressed with public interest.  He went outside the law when he threatened to seal the bankâs vault and to forcibly seize any money he may possibly retrieve from the tellerâs cages, if he were not paid in cash the full amount demanded.  He levied on sensitive computers of the bank threatening not only to disrupt but to collapse its operations.
In 
Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Fuentes and Sheriff Paralisan
,
[30]
 the Court characterized such abuse in the implementation of a writ of execution as âgrave misconduct or conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service,â which deserve the penalty of dismissal from the service.
Respondent Sheriff Nequinto has not even complied with 
three
 show cause orders of this court.  His conduct was highhanded and arbitrary and even defied the Supreme Courtâs directives.  His corrupt and ulterior motives were self-evident.
[31]
Sheriffs ought to perform their duties with utmost responsibility, integrity, competence and loyalty, and with justice, lead modest lives, and uphold public interest.
[32]
 In this case, respondent sheriff failed to observe the strict standards required of all public officers and employees.
[33]
 He must remember that overbearing conduct can only bring their office into disrepute and erode public respect.
[34]
The Fallo
WHEREFORE,
 the Court finds respondent Ruben S. Nequinto, Sheriff IV, Regional Trial Court, Makati, Branch 145, guilty of grave misconduct, grave abuse of authority, and conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the service and hereby 
DISMISSES
 him from the service with forfeiture of retirement benefits, except earned leave credits, if any, with prejudice to reinstatement and reemployment in any branch, instrumentality or agency of the government including government owned and controlled corporations, particularly the DBP.
