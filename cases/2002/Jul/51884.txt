FRANCISCO I. CHAVEZ, PETITIONER,
VS. PUBLIC ESTATES AUTHORITY AND AMARI COASTAL BAY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION,
RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




CARPIO, J.:


This is an
original Petition for 
Mandamus
 with prayer for a writ of preliminary
injunction and a temporary restraining order. The petition seeks to compel the
Public Estates Authority (âPEAâ for brevity) to disclose all facts on PEAâs
then on-going renegotiations with Amari Coastal Bay and Development Corporation
(âAMARIâ for brevity) to reclaim portions of Manila Bay.  The petition further seeks to enjoin PEA
from signing a new agreement with AMARI involving such reclamation.


The
Facts


On November 20,
1973, the government, through the Commissioner of Public Highways, signed a
contract with the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines
(âCDCPâ for brevity) to reclaim certain foreshore and offshore areas of Manila
Bay.  The contract also included the
construction of Phases I and II of the Manila-Cavite Coastal Road.  CDCP obligated itself to carry out all the
works in consideration of fifty percent of the total reclaimed land.


On February 4,
1977, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 1084
creating PEA.  PD No. 1084 tasked PEA âto
reclaim land, including foreshore and submerged areas,â and âto develop,
improve, acquire, x x x lease and sell any and all kinds of lands.â
[1]
 On the
same date, then President Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 1085
transferring to PEA the âlands reclaimed in the foreshore and offshore of the
Manila Bayâ
[2]
 under the
Manila-Cavite Coastal Road and Reclamation Project (MCCRRP).


On December 29,
1981, then President Marcos issued a memorandum directing PEA to amend its
contract with CDCP, so that â[A]ll future works in MCCRRP x x x shall be funded
and owned by PEA.â  Accordingly, PEA and
CDCP executed a Memorandum of Agreement dated December 29, 1981, which stated:


â(i) CDCP
shall undertake all reclamation, construction, and such other works in the
MCCRRP as may be agreed upon by the parties, to be paid according to progress
of works on a unit price/lump sum basis for items of work to be agreed upon,
subject to price escalation, retention and other terms and conditions provided
for in Presidential Decree No. 1594.  All the financing required for such works shall be provided by PEA.


x x x 


(iii) x x
x CDCP shall give up all its development rights and hereby agrees to cede and
transfer in favor of PEA, all of the rights, title, interest and participation
of CDCP in and to all the areas of land reclaimed by CDCP in the MCCRRP as of
December 30, 1981 which have not yet been sold, transferred or otherwise
disposed of by CDCP as  of said date,
which areas consist of approximately Ninety-Nine Thousand Four Hundred Seventy
Three (99,473) square meters in the Financial Center Area covered by land
pledge No. 5 and approximately Three Million Three Hundred Eighty Two Thousand
Eight Hundred Eighty Eight (3,382,888) square meters of reclaimed areas at
varying elevations above Mean Low Water Level located outside the Financial
Center Area and the First Neighborhood Unit.â
[3]


On January 19,
1988, then President Corazon C. Aquino issued Special Patent No. 3517, granting
and transferring to PEA âthe parcels of land so reclaimed under the
Manila-Cavite Coastal Road and Reclamation Project (MCCRRP) containing a total
area of one million nine hundred fifteen thousand eight hundred ninety four
(1,915,894) square meters.â Subsequently, on April 9, 1988, the Register of
Deeds of the Municipality of ParaÃ±aque issued Transfer Certificates of Title
Nos. 7309, 7311, and 7312, in the name of PEA, covering the three reclaimed
islands known as the âFreedom Islandsâ located at the southern portion of the
Manila-Cavite Coastal Road, ParaÃ±aque City.  The Freedom Islands have a total land area of One Million Five Hundred
Seventy Eight Thousand Four Hundred and Forty One (1,578,441) square meters or
157.841 hectares.


On April 25,
1995, PEA entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (âJVAâ for brevity) with
AMARI, a private corporation, to develop the Freedom Islands.  The JVA also required the reclamation of an
additional 250 hectares of submerged areas surrounding these islands to
complete the configuration in the Master Development Plan of the Southern
Reclamation Project-MCCRRP.  PEA and
AMARI entered into the JVA through negotiation without public bidding.
[4]
 On April
28, 1995, the Board of Directors of PEA, in its Resolution No. 1245, confirmed
the JVA.
 
[5]
 On June
8, 1995, then President Fidel V. Ramos, through then Executive Secretary Ruben
Torres, approved the JVA.
[6]


On November 29,
1996, then Senate President Ernesto Maceda delivered a privilege speech in the
Senate and denounced the JVA as the âgrandmother of all scams.â As a result,
the Senate Committee on Government Corporations and Public Enterprises, and the
Committee on Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations, conducted a
joint investigation.  The Senate
Committees reported the results of their investigation in Senate Committee
Report No. 560 dated September 16, 1997.
[7]
 Among the
conclusions of their report are: (1) the reclaimed lands PEA seeks to transfer
to AMARI under the JVA are lands of the public domain which the government has
not classified as alienable lands and therefore PEA cannot alienate these
lands; (2) the certificates of title covering the Freedom Islands are thus
void, and (3) the JVA itself is illegal.


On December 5,
1997, then President Fidel V. Ramos issued Presidential Administrative Order
No. 365 creating a Legal Task Force to conduct a study on the legality of the
JVA in view of Senate Committee Report No. 560.  The members of the Legal Task Force were the Secretary of Justice,
[8]
 the Chief
Presidential Legal Counsel,
[9]
 
and the
Government Corporate Counsel.
[10]
 
The Legal Task Force upheld the legality of the JVA,
contrary to the conclusions reached by the Senate Committees.
[11]


On April 4 and
5, 1998, the 
Philippine Daily Inquirer
 and 
Today
 published
reports that there were on-going renegotiations between PEA and AMARI under an
order issued by then President Fidel V. Ramos.  According to these reports, PEA Director Nestor Kalaw, PEA Chairman
Arsenio Yulo and retired Navy Officer Sergio Cruz composed the negotiating
panel of PEA.


On April 13,
1998, Antonio M. Zulueta filed before the Court a 
Petition for Prohibition
with Application for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and
Preliminary Injunction 
docketed as G.R. No. 132994 seeking to nullify the
JVA.  The Court dismissed the petition
âfor unwarranted disregard of judicial hierarchy, without prejudice to the
refiling of the case before the proper court.â
[12]


On April 27,
1998, petitioner Frank I. Chavez (âPetitionerâ for brevity) as a taxpayer,
filed the instant 
Petition for Mandamus with Prayer for the Issuance of a
Writ of Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order
.  Petitioner contends the government stands to
lose billions of pesos in the sale by PEA of the reclaimed lands to AMARI.  Petitioner prays that PEA publicly disclose
the terms of any renegotiation of the JVA, invoking Section 28, Article II, and
Section 7, Article III, of the 1987 Constitution on the right of the people to
information on matters of public concern.  Petitioner assails the sale to AMARI of lands of the public domain as a
blatant violation of Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution
prohibiting the sale of alienable lands of the public domain to private
corporations. Finally, petitioner asserts that he seeks to enjoin the loss of
billions of pesos in properties of the State that are of public dominion.


After several
motions for extension of time,
[13]
 
PEA and
AMARI filed their Comments on October 19, 1998 and June 25, 1998,
respectively.  Meanwhile, on December
28, 1998, petitioner filed an Omnibus Motion:  (a) to require PEA to submit the terms of the renegotiated PEA-AMARI
contract; (b) for issuance of a temporary restraining order; and (c) to set the
case for hearing on oral argument.  Petitioner filed a Reiterative Motion for Issuance of a TRO dated May
26, 1999, which the Court denied in a Resolution dated June 22, 1999.


In a Resolution
dated March 23, 1999, the Court gave due course to the petition and required
the parties to file their respective memoranda.


On March 30,
1999, PEA and AMARI signed the Amended Joint Venture Agreement (âAmended JVA,â
for brevity).  On May 28, 1999, the
Office of the President under the administration of then President Joseph E.
Estrada approved the Amended JVA. 


Due to the
approval of the Amended JVA by the Office of the President, petitioner now
prays that on âconstitutional and statutory grounds the renegotiated contract
be declared null and void.â
[14]


The
Issues


The issues
raised by petitioner, PEA
[15]
 
and AMARI
[16]
 are as
follows: 


I.
    
WHETHER
THE PRINCIPAL RELIEFS PRAYED FOR IN THE PETITION ARE MOOT AND ACADEMIC BECAUSE
OF SUBSEQUENT EVENTS;


II.
   
WHETHER THE PETITION MERITS DISMISSAL FOR FAILING TO OBSERVE THE
PRINCIPLE GOVERNING THE HIERARCHY OF COURTS;


III.
  
WHETHER THE PETITION MERITS DISMISSAL FOR NON-EXHAUSTION OF
ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES;


IV.
 
WHETHER PETITIONER HAS 
LOCUS STANDI
 TO BRING THIS SUIT;


V.
  
WHETHER
THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO INFORMATION INCLUDES OFFICIAL INFORMATION ON
ON-GOING NEGOTIATIONS BEFORE A FINAL AGREEMENT;


VI.
 
WHETHER THE STIPULATIONS IN THE AMENDED JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT FOR
THE TRANSFER TO AMARI OF CERTAIN LANDS, RECLAIMED AND STILL TO BE RECLAIMED,
VIOLATE THE 1987 CONSTITUTION; AND


VII. WHETHER THE COURT IS THE
PROPER FORUM FOR RAISING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THE AMENDED JOINT VENTURE
AGREEMENT IS GROSSLY DISADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT.


The
Courtâs Ruling


First issue: whether the principal reliefs prayed for in the
petition  are moot and academic because
of subsequent events.


The petition
prays that PEA publicly disclose the âterms and conditions of the on-going
negotiations for a new agreement.â  The
petition also prays that the Court enjoin PEA from âprivately entering into,
perfecting and/or executing any new agreement with AMARI.â


PEA and AMARI
claim the petition is now moot and academic because AMARI furnished petitioner
on June 21, 1999 a copy of the signed Amended JVA containing the terms and
conditions agreed upon in the renegotiations.  Thus, PEA has satisfied petitionerâs prayer for a public disclosure of
the renegotiations.  Likewise,
petitionerâs prayer to enjoin the signing of the Amended JVA is now moot
because PEA and AMARI have already signed the Amended JVA on March 30,
1999.  Moreover, the Office of the
President has approved the Amended JVA on May 28, 1999.


Petitioner
counters that PEA and AMARI cannot avoid the constitutional issue by simply
fast-tracking the signing and approval of the Amended JVA before the Court
could act on the issue.  Presidential
approval does not resolve the constitutional issue or remove it from the ambit
of judicial review.


We rule that the
signing of the Amended JVA by PEA and AMARI and its approval by the President
cannot operate to moot the petition and divest the Court of its
jurisdiction.  PEA and AMARI have still
to implement the Amended JVA.  The
prayer to enjoin the signing of the Amended JVA on constitutional grounds
necessarily includes preventing its implementation if in the meantime PEA and
AMARI have signed one in violation of the Constitution.  Petitionerâs principal basis in assailing
the renegotiation of the JVA is its violation of Section 3, Article XII of the
Constitution, which prohibits the government from alienating lands of the
public domain to private corporations.  If the Amended JVA indeed violates the Constitution, it is the duty of
the Court to enjoin its implementation, and if already implemented, to annul
the effects of such unconstitutional contract.


The Amended JVA
is not an ordinary commercial contract but one which seeks to 
transfer
title and ownership to 367.5 hectares of reclaimed lands and submerged areas of
Manila Bay to a single private corporation
.  It now becomes more compelling for the Court to resolve the issue
to insure the government itself does not violate a provision of the
Constitution intended to safeguard the national patrimony.  Supervening events, whether intended or
accidental, cannot prevent the Court from rendering a decision if there is a
grave violation of the Constitution. In the instant case, if the Amended JVA
runs counter to the Constitution, the Court can still prevent the transfer of
title and ownership of alienable lands of the public domain in the name of
AMARI.  Even in cases where supervening
events had made the cases moot, the Court did not hesitate to resolve the legal
or constitutional issues raised to formulate controlling principles to guide
the bench, bar, and the public.
[17]


Also, the
instant petition is a case of first impression.  All previous decisions of the Court involving Section 3, Article
XII of the 1987 Constitution, or its counterpart provision in the 1973
Constitution,
[18]
 
covered 
agricultural
lands
 sold to private corporations which acquired the lands from
private parties.  The transferors of the
private corporations claimed or could claim the right to 
judicial
confirmation of their imperfect titles
[19]
 
under 
Title
II
 of Commonwealth Act. 141 (âCA No. 141â for brevity).  In the instant case, AMARI seeks to acquire
from PEA, a public corporation, reclaimed
 
lands and submerged
areas for 
non-agricultural 
purposes by
 purchase

under PD No. 1084 (charter of PEA) and 
Title III
 of CA No.
141.  Certain undertakings by AMARI
under the Amended JVA constitute the consideration for the purchase.  Neither AMARI nor PEA can claim judicial
confirmation of their titles because the lands covered by the Amended JVA are
newly reclaimed or still to be reclaimed.  Judicial confirmation of imperfect title requires open, continuous,
exclusive and notorious occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain
for at least thirty years since June 12, 1945 or earlier.  Besides, the deadline for filing
applications for judicial confirmation of imperfect title expired on December
31, 1987.
[20]


Lastly, there is
a need to resolve immediately the constitutional issue raised in this petition
because of the possible transfer at any time by PEA to AMARI of title and
ownership to portions of the reclaimed lands.  Under the Amended JVA, PEA is obligated to transfer to AMARI the
latterâs seventy percent proportionate share in the reclaimed areas as the reclamation
progresses.  The Amended JVA even allows
AMARI to mortgage at any time the 
entire
 reclaimed area to raise
financing for the reclamation project.
[21]


Second
issue: whether the petition merits dismissal for failing to observe the
principle governing the hierarchy of courts.


PEA and AMARI
claim petitioner ignored the judicial hierarchy by seeking relief directly from
the Court.  The principle of hierarchy
of courts applies generally to cases involving factual questions.  As it is not a trier of facts, the Court
cannot entertain cases involving factual issues. The instant case, however,
raises constitutional issues of transcendental importance to the public.
[22]
 
The Court
can resolve this case without determining any factual issue related to the
case.  Also, the instant case is a
petition for 
mandamus
 which falls under the 
original

jurisdiction of the Court under Section 5, Article VIII of the
Constitution.  We resolve to exercise
primary jurisdiction over the instant case. 


Third
issue: whether the petition merits dismissal for non-exhaustion of
administrative remedies.


PEA faults
petitioner for seeking judicial intervention in compelling PEA to disclose
publicly certain information without first asking PEA the needed
information.  PEA claims petitionerâs direct
resort to the Court violates the principle of exhaustion of administrative
remedies. It also violates the rule that mandamus may issue only if there is no
other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.


PEA
distinguishes the instant case from 
TaÃ±ada v. Tuvera
[23]
 
where the Court granted the
petition for 
mandamus
 even if the petitioners there did not initially
demand from the Office of the President the publication of the presidential
decrees.  PEA points out that in 
TaÃ±ada
,
the Executive Department had an 
affirmative statutory duty
 under
Article 2 of the Civil Code
[24]
 and
Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 638
[25]
 
to publish
the presidential decrees. There was, therefore, no need for the petitioners in 
TaÃ±ada

to make an initial demand from the Office of the President.  In the instant case, PEA claims it has no
affirmative statutory duty to disclose publicly information about its
renegotiation of the JVA.  Thus, PEA
asserts that the Court must apply the principle of exhaustion of administrative
remedies to the instant case in view of the failure of petitioner here to
demand initially from PEA the needed information.


The original JVA
sought to dispose to AMARI public lands held by PEA, a government
corporation.  Under Section 79 of the
Government Auditing Code,
[26]
2
 the disposition of government lands to private
parties requires public bidding.  
PEA
was under a positive legal duty to disclose to the public the terms and
conditions for the sale of its lands
.  The law obligated PEA to make this public disclosure even without demand
from petitioner or from anyone.  PEA
failed to make this public disclosure because the original JVA, like the
Amended JVA, was the result of a 
negotiated contract
, not of a
public bidding.  Considering that PEA
had an affirmative statutory duty to make the public disclosure, and was even
in breach of this legal duty, petitioner had the right to seek direct judicial
intervention.


Moreover, and
this alone is determinative of this issue, the principle of exhaustion of
administrative remedies does not apply when the issue involved is a purely
legal or constitutional question.
[27]
 
The
principal issue in the instant case is the capacity of AMARI to acquire lands
held by PEA in view of the constitutional ban prohibiting the alienation of
lands of the public domain to private corporations.  We rule that the principle of exhaustion of administrative
remedies does not apply in the instant case.


Fourth
issue: whether petitioner has locus standi to bring this suit


PEA argues that
petitioner has no standing to institute 
mandamus
 proceedings to
enforce his constitutional right to information without a showing that PEA
refused to perform an affirmative duty imposed on PEA by the Constitution.  PEA also claims that petitioner has not
shown that he will suffer any concrete injury because of the signing or
implementation of the Amended JVA.  Thus, there is no actual controversy requiring the exercise of the power
of judicial review.


The petitioner
has standing to bring this taxpayerâs suit because the petition seeks to compel
PEA to comply with its constitutional duties.  There are two constitutional issues involved here.  First is the right of citizens to
information on matters of public concern.  Second is the application of a constitutional provision intended to
insure the equitable distribution of alienable lands of the public domain among
Filipino citizens.  The thrust of the
first issue is to compel PEA to disclose publicly information on the sale of
government lands worth billions of pesos, information which the Constitution
and statutory law mandate PEA to disclose.  The thrust of the second issue is to prevent PEA from alienating
hundreds of hectares of alienable lands of the public domain in violation of
the Constitution, compelling PEA to comply with a constitutional duty to the
nation.


Moreover, the
petition raises matters of transcendental importance to the public.  In 
Chavez v. PCGG
,
[28]
 
the Court
upheld the right of a citizen to bring a taxpayerâs suit on matters of
transcendental importance to the public, thus -


âBesides, petitioner emphasizes,
the matter of recovering the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses is an issue of
âtranscendental importance to the public.â  He asserts that ordinary taxpayers have a right to initiate and
prosecute actions questioning the validity of acts or orders of government
agencies or instrumentalities, if the issues raised are of âparamount public
interest,â and if they âimmediately affect the social, economic and moral well
being of the people.â


Moreover, the mere fact that he is
a citizen satisfies the requirement of personal interest, when the proceeding
involves the assertion of a public right, such as in this case.  He invokes several decisions of this Court
which have set aside the procedural matter of 
locus standi
, when the
subject of the case involved public interest.


x x x


In 
TaÃ±ada v. Tuvera
, the
Court asserted that when the issue concerns a public right and the object of
mandamus is to obtain the enforcement of a public duty, the people are regarded
as the real parties in interest; and because it is sufficient that petitioner
is a citizen and as such is interested in the execution of the laws, he need
not show that he has any legal or special interest in the result of the action.
In the aforesaid case, the petitioners sought to enforce their right to be
informed on matters of public concern, a right then recognized in Section 6,
Article IV of the 1973 Constitution, in connection with the rule that laws in
order to be valid and enforceable must be published in the Official Gazette or
otherwise effectively promulgated. In ruling for the petitioners' legal
standing, the Court declared that the right they sought to be enforced âis a
public right recognized by no less than the fundamental law of the land.â


Legaspi v. Civil Service
Commission
, while reiterating 
TaÃ±ada
,
further declared that âwhen a mandamus proceeding involves the assertion of a
public right, the requirement of personal interest is satisfied by the mere fact
that petitioner is a citizen and, therefore, part of the general 'public' which
possesses the right.â


Further, in 
Albano v. Reyes
,
we said that while expenditure of public funds may not have been involved under
the questioned contract for the development, management and operation of the
Manila International Container Terminal, âpublic interest [was] definitely
involved considering the important role [of the subject contract] . . . in the
economic development of the country and the magnitude of the financial
consideration involved.â We concluded that, as a consequence, the disclosure
provision in the Constitution would constitute sufficient authority for
upholding the petitioner's standing.


Similarly, the instant petition is
anchored on the right of the people to information and access to official
records, documents and papers â a right guaranteed under Section 7, Article III
of the 1987 Constitution. Petitioner, a former solicitor general, is a Filipino
citizen. Because of the satisfaction of the two basic requisites laid down by
decisional law to sustain petitioner's legal standing, i.e. (1) the enforcement
of a public right (2) espoused by a Filipino citizen, we rule that the petition
at bar should be allowed.â


We rule that
since the instant petition, brought by a citizen, involves the enforcement of
constitutional rights  -  to information and to the equitable
diffusion of natural resources  -  matters of transcendental public
importance,  the petitioner has the
requisite 
locus standi
.


Fifth
issue: whether the constitutional right to information includes official
information on on-going negotiations before a final agreement.


Section 7,
Article III of the Constitution explains the peopleâs right to information on
matters of public concern in this manner:


âSec. 7.  The right of the people to information on matters of public
concern shall be recognized.  
Access
to official records, and to documents, and papers pertaining to official acts,
transactions, or decisions,
 as well as to government research data used
as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such
limitations as may be provided by law.â  (Emphasis supplied)


The State policy of full transparency in all transactions involving
public interest reinforces the peopleâs right to information on matters of
public concern.  This State policy is
expressed in Section 28, Article II of the Constitution, thus:


âSec. 28.  Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State
adopts and implements a 
policy of full public disclosure of all its
transactions involving public interest
.â (Emphasis supplied)


These twin
provisions of the Constitution seek to promote transparency in policy-making
and in the operations of the government, as well as provide the people
sufficient information to exercise effectively other constitutional
rights.  These twin provisions are
essential to the exercise of freedom of expression.  If the government does not disclose its official acts,
transactions and decisions to citizens, whatever citizens say, even if
expressed without any restraint, will be speculative and amount to
nothing.  These twin provisions are
also essential to hold public officials âat all times x x x accountable to the
people,â
[29]
 
for unless
citizens have the proper information, they cannot hold public officials
accountable for anything.  Armed with
the right information, citizens can participate in public discussions leading
to the formulation of government policies and their effective implementation.  An informed citizenry is essential to the
existence and proper functioning of any democracy.  As explained by the Court in 
Valmonte v. Belmonte, Jr
.
[30]
â


âAn
essential element of these freedoms is to keep open a continuing dialogue or
process of communication between the government and the people.  It is in the interest of the State that the
channels for free political discussion be maintained to the end that the
government may perceive and be responsive to the peopleâs will.  Yet, this open dialogue can be effective
only to the extent that the citizenry is informed and thus able to formulate
its will intelligently.  Only when the
participants in the discussion are aware of the issues and have access to
information relating thereto can such bear fruit.â


PEA asserts,
citing 
Chavez v. PCGG
,
[31]
 
that in
cases of on-going negotiations the right to information is limited to âdefinite
propositions of the government.â  PEA
maintains the right does not include access to âintra-agency or inter-agency
recommendations or communications during the stage when common assertions are
still in the process of being formulated or are in the âexploratory stageâ.â


Also, AMARI
contends that petitioner cannot invoke the right at the pre-decisional stage or
before the closing of the transaction.  To support its contention, AMARI cites the following discussion in the
1986 Constitutional Commission:


âMr.
Suarez
.  And when we say âtransactionsâ which should be distinguished from
contracts, agreements, or treaties or whatever, does the Gentleman refer to the
steps leading to the consummation of the contract, or does he refer to the
contract itself?


Mr.
Ople
: 
The âtransactionsâ used
here, I suppose is generic and therefore, it can cover both steps leading to a
contract and already a consummated contract, Mr. Presiding Officer
.


Mr.
Suarez
:  
This contemplates inclusion of negotiations leading to the
consummation of the transaction
.


Mr.
Ople
:  
Yes, subject only to reasonable safeguards on the national
interest
.


Mr.
Suarez

AMARI argues there must first be a consummated contract before
petitioner can invoke the right.  Requiring government officials to reveal their deliberations at the
pre-decisional stage will degrade the quality of decision-making in government
agencies.  Government officials will
hesitate to express their real sentiments during deliberations if there is
immediate public dissemination of their discussions, putting them under all
kinds of pressure before they decide. 


We must first
distinguish between information the law on public bidding requires PEA to
disclose publicly, and information the constitutional right to information
requires PEA to release to the public.  Before the consummation of the contract, PEA must, on its own and
without demand from anyone, disclose to the public matters relating to the
disposition of its property.  These
include the size, location, technical description and nature of the property
being disposed of, the terms and conditions of the disposition, the parties
qualified to bid, the minimum price and similar information.  PEA must prepare all these data and
disclose them to the public at the start of the disposition process, long
before the consummation of the contract, because the Government Auditing Code
requires 
public bidding
.  If PEA fails to make this disclosure, any citizen can demand from PEA
this information at any time during the bidding process.


Information,
however, on 
on-going evaluation or review
 of bids or proposals
being undertaken by the bidding or review committee is not immediately
accessible under the right to information.  While the evaluation or review is still on-going, there are no âofficial
acts, transactions, or decisionsâ on the bids or proposals.  However, once the committee makes its 
official
recommendation
, there arises a 
âdefinite propositionâ
 on
the part of the government.  From this
moment, the publicâs right to information attaches, and any citizen can access
all the non-proprietary information leading to such definite proposition.  In 
Chavez v. PCGG
,
[33]
 
the Court
ruled as follows:


âConsidering
the intent of the framers of the Constitution, we believe that it is incumbent
upon the PCGG and its officers, as well as other government representatives, to
disclose sufficient public information on any proposed settlement they have
decided to take up with the ostensible owners and holders of ill-gotten
wealth.  Such information, though, must
pertain to 
definite propositions of the government
, not
necessarily to intra-agency or inter-agency recommendations or communications
during the stage when common assertions are still in the process of being
formulated or are in the âexploratoryâ stage. There is need, of course, to
observe the same restrictions on disclosure of information in general, as
discussed earlier â such as on matters involving national security, diplomatic
or foreign relations, intelligence and other classified information.â  (Emphasis supplied)


Contrary to
AMARIâs contention, the commissioners of the 1986 Constitutional Commission
understood that the right to information â
contemplates inclusion of
negotiations leading to the consummation of the transaction
.â  Certainly, a consummated contract is not a
requirement for the exercise of the right to information.  Otherwise, the people can never exercise the
right if no contract is consummated, and if one is consummated, it may be too
late for the public to expose its defects.


Requiring a
consummated contract will keep the public in the dark until the contract, which
may be grossly disadvantageous to the government or even illegal, becomes a 
fait
accompli
.  This negates the State
policy of full transparency on matters of public concern, a situation which the
framers of the Constitution could not have intended.  Such a requirement will prevent the citizenry from participating
in the public discussion of any 
proposed
 contract, effectively
truncating a basic right enshrined in the Bill of Rights.  We can allow neither an emasculation of a
constitutional right, nor a retreat by the State of its avowed âpolicy of full
disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest.â


The right covers
three categories of information which are âmatters of public concern,â namely:
(1) official records; (2) documents and papers pertaining to official acts,
transactions and decisions; and (3) government research data used in
formulating policies.  The first
category refers to any document that is part of the public records in the
custody of government agencies or officials.  The second category refers to documents and papers recording,
evidencing, establishing, confirming, supporting, justifying or explaining
official acts, transactions or decisions of government agencies or
officials.  The third category refers to
research data, whether raw, collated or processed, owned by the government and
used in formulating government policies.


The information
that petitioner may access on the renegotiation of the JVA includes evaluation
reports, recommendations, legal and expert opinions, minutes of meetings, terms
of reference and other documents attached to such reports or minutes, all
relating to the JVA.  However, the right
to information does not compel PEA to prepare lists, abstracts, summaries and
the like relating to the renegotiation of the JVA.
[34]
 
The right
only affords access to records, documents and papers, which means the
opportunity to inspect and copy them.  One who exercises the right must copy the records, documents and papers
at his expense.  The exercise of the
right is also subject to reasonable regulations to protect the integrity of the
public records and to minimize disruption to government operations, like rules
specifying when and how to conduct the inspection and copying.
[35]


The right to
information, however, does not extend to matters recognized as privileged
information under the separation of powers.
[36]
 
The right
does not also apply to information on military and diplomatic secrets,
information affecting national security, and information on investigations of
crimes by law enforcement agencies before the prosecution of the accused, which
courts have long recognized as confidential.
[37]
 The right
may also be subject to other limitations that Congress may impose by law.


There is no
claim by PEA that the information demanded by petitioner is privileged
information rooted in the separation of powers.  The information does not cover Presidential conversations,
correspondences, or discussions during closed-door Cabinet meetings which, like
internal deliberations of the Supreme Court and other collegiate courts, or
executive sessions of either house of Congress,
[38]
 
are
recognized as confidential.  This kind
of information cannot be pried open by a co-equal branch of government.  A frank exchange of exploratory ideas and
assessments, free from the glare of publicity and pressure by interested
parties, is essential to protect the independence of decision-making of those
tasked to exercise Presidential, Legislative and Judicial power.
[39]
 
This is
not the situation in the instant case.


We rule,
therefore, that the constitutional right to information includes official
information on 
on-going negotiations
 before a final
contract.  The information, however,
must constitute definite propositions by the government and should not cover
recognized exceptions like privileged information, military and diplomatic
secrets and similar matters affecting national security and public order.
[40]
 
Congress
has also prescribed other limitations on the right to information in several
legislations.
[41]


Sixth
issue: whether stipulations in the Amended JVA for the transfer to AMARI of
lands, reclaimed or to be reclaimed, violate the Constitution.


The Regalian Doctrine


The ownership of
lands reclaimed from foreshore and submerged areas is rooted in the Regalian
doctrine which holds that the State owns all lands and waters of the public
domain.  Upon the Spanish conquest of
the Philippines, ownership of all âlands, territories and possessionsâ in the
Philippines passed to the Spanish Crown.
[42]
 The King,
as the sovereign ruler and representative of the people, acquired and owned all
lands and territories in the Philippines except those he disposed of by grant
or sale to private individuals.


The 1935, 1973
and 1987 Constitutions adopted the Regalian doctrine substituting, however, the
State, in lieu of the King, as the owner of all lands and waters of the public
domain.  The Regalian doctrine is the
foundation of the time-honored principle of land ownership that âall lands that
were not acquired from the Government, either by purchase or by grant, belong
to the public domain.â
[43]
 Article
339 of the Civil Code of 1889, which is now Article 420 of the Civil Code of
1950, incorporated the Regalian doctrine.


Ownership and Disposition of Reclaimed Lands


The Spanish Law
of Waters of 1866 was the first statutory law governing the ownership and
disposition of reclaimed lands in the Philippines.  On May 18, 1907, the Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 1654
which provided 
for the lease, but not the sale, of reclaimed lands of the
government to corporations and individuals
. Later, on November 29,
1919, the Philippine Legislature approved Act No. 2874, the Public Land Act,
which authorized 
the lease, but not the sale, of reclaimed lands of the
government to corporations and individuals
.  On November 7, 1936, the National Assembly passed Commonwealth
Act No. 141, also known as the Public Land Act, which authorized 
the
lease, but not the sale, of reclaimed lands of the government to corporations
and individuals. 
  CA No. 141
continues to this day as the general law governing the classification and
disposition of lands of the public domain.


The Spanish Law of Waters of 1866 and the Civil Code of 1889


Under the
Spanish Law of Waters of 1866, the shores, bays, coves, inlets and all waters
within the maritime zone of the Spanish territory belonged to the public domain
for public use.
[44]
 
The
Spanish Law of Waters of 1866 allowed the reclamation of the sea under Article
5, which provided as follows:


âArticle 5.  Lands reclaimed from the sea in consequence
of works constructed by the State, or by the provinces, pueblos or private
persons, with proper permission, shall become the property of the party
constructing such works, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the grant of
authority.â


Under the Spanish Law of Waters, land reclaimed from the sea belonged to
the party undertaking the reclamation, provided the government issued the
necessary permit and did not reserve ownership of the reclaimed land to the
State.


Article 339 of
the Civil Code of 1889 defined property of public dominion as follows:


âArt. 339. Property of public
dominion is â


1.
  
That
devoted to public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports and
bridges constructed by the State, riverbanks, shores, roadsteads, and that of a
similar character;


2.
  
That
belonging exclusively to the State which, without being of general public use,
is employed in some public service, or in the development of the national
wealth, such as walls, fortresses, and other works for the defense of the
territory, and mines, until granted to private individuals.â


Property devoted to public use referred to property open for use by the
public.  In contrast, property devoted
to public service referred to property used for some specific public service
and open only to those authorized to use the property.


Property of
public dominion referred not only to property devoted to public use, but also
to property not so used but employed 
to develop the national wealth
.  This class of property constituted property of
public dominion although employed for some economic or commercial activity to
increase the national wealth.


Article 341 of
the Civil Code of 1889 governed the re-classification of property of public
dominion into private property, to wit:


âArt. 341. Property of public
dominion, when no longer devoted to public use or to the defense of the
territory, shall become a part of the private property of the State.â


This provision, however, was not self-executing.  The legislature, or the executive department
pursuant to law, must declare the property no longer needed for public use or
territorial defense before the government could lease or alienate the property
to private parties.
[45]


Act No. 1654 of the Philippine Commission


On May 8, 1907,
the Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 1654 which regulated the lease of
reclaimed and foreshore lands.  The
salient provisions of this law were as follows:


âSection 1. The 
control and
disposition of the foreshore
 as defined in existing law, and the 
title
to all Government or public lands made or reclaimed by the Government
 
by
dredging or filling
 or otherwise throughout the Philippine Islands, 
shall
be retained by the Government
 without prejudice to vested rights and
without prejudice to rights conceded to the City of Manila in the Luneta
Extension.


Section 2.  (a) The Secretary of the Interior shall
cause all Government or public lands made or reclaimed by the Government by
dredging or filling or otherwise to be divided into lots or blocks, with the
necessary streets and alleyways located thereon, and shall cause plats and
plans of such surveys to be prepared and filed with the Bureau of Lands. 


(b) Upon completion of such plats
and plans 
the Governor-General shall give notice to the public that such
parts of the lands so made or reclaimed as are not needed for public purposes
will be leased for commercial and business purposes
, x x x. 


x x x


(e) 
The leases above provided
for shall be disposed of to the highest and best bidder
 therefore,
subject to such regulations and safeguards as the Governor-General may by
executive order prescribe.â (Emphasis supplied)


Act No. 1654
mandated that the 
government should retain title to all lands reclaimed
by the government.
  The Act also
vested in the government control and disposition of foreshore lands.  Private parties could lease lands reclaimed
by the government only if these lands were no longer needed for public purpose.  Act No. 1654 mandated 
public bidding

in the lease of government reclaimed lands.  Act No. 1654 made government reclaimed lands 
sui generis 
in
that unlike other public lands which the government could sell to private
parties, these reclaimed lands were available only for lease to private
parties.


Act No. 1654,
however, did not repeal Section 5 of the Spanish Law of Waters of 1866.  Act No. 1654 did not prohibit private
parties from reclaiming parts of the sea under Section 5 of the Spanish Law of
Waters.  Lands reclaimed from the sea by
private parties with government permission remained private lands.


Act No. 2874 of the Philippine Legislature


On November 29,
1919, the Philippine Legislature enacted Act No. 2874, the Public Land Act.
[46]
 The
salient provisions of Act No. 2874, on reclaimed lands, were as follows:


âSec. 6. 
The Governor-General, upon the
recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, shall
from time to time classify the lands of the public domain into â


(a)

Alienable or disposable
,


(b)
Timber, and


(c) Mineral
lands, x x x.


Sec. 7.  For the purposes of the government and disposition of alienable
or disposable public lands, 
the Governor-General
, 
upon
recommendation by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
 
shall
from time to time declare what lands are open to disposition or concession
under this Act
.â


Sec. 8.  
Only
those lands shall be declared open to disposition or concession which have been
officially delimited or classified
 x x x.


x x x


Sec.  55.  Any tract of land of
the public domain which, being neither timber nor mineral land, shall be
classified as 
suitable for residential purposes or for commercial,
industrial, or other productive purposes other than agricultural purposes, 
and
shall be open to disposition or concession, shall be disposed of under the
provisions of this chapter, and not otherwise.


Sec. 56.  
The
lands disposable under this title shall be classified as follows:


(
a)
Lands reclaimed by the Government by dredging, filling, or other means;


(b)
Foreshore
;


(c)
Marshy lands
 or lands covered
with water bordering upon the shores or banks of navigable lakes or rivers;


(d)
Lands not included in any of the foregoing classes.


x x x.


Sec. 58.  
The lands comprised in classes (a), (b), and (c) of section
fifty-six shall be disposed of to private parties by lease only and not
otherwise
, as soon as 
the Governor-General, upon recommendation
by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
 
shall
declare that the same are not necessary for the public service and are open to
disposition
 under this chapter.  
The lands included in class (d) may be disposed of by sale or
lease under the provisions of this Act
.â  (Emphasis supplied)


Section 6 of Act
No. 2874 authorized the Governor-General to âclassify lands of the public
domain into x x x alienable or disposableâ
[47]

lands.  Section 7 of the Act empowered
the Governor-General to âdeclare what lands are open to disposition or
concession.â Section 8 of the Act limited alienable or disposable lands only to
those lands which have been âofficially delimited and classified.â


Section 56 of
Act No. 2874 stated that lands âdisposable under this title
[48]
 
shall be
classifiedâ as government reclaimed, foreshore and marshy lands, as well as
other lands. All these lands, however, must be suitable for residential, commercial,
industrial or other productive 
non-agricultural
 purposes.  These provisions vested upon the
Governor-General the power to classify inalienable lands of the public domain
into disposable lands of the public domain. These provisions also empowered the
Governor-General to classify further such disposable lands of the public domain
into government reclaimed, foreshore or marshy lands of the public domain, as
well as other non-agricultural lands.


Section 58 of
Act No. 2874 categorically mandated that disposable lands of the public domain
classified as government reclaimed, foreshore and marshy lands 
âshall be
disposed of to private parties by lease only and not otherwise.â
 The
Governor-General, before allowing the lease of these lands to private parties, must
formally declare that the lands were ânot necessary for the public
service.â  Act No. 2874 reiterated the
State policy to lease and not to sell government reclaimed, foreshore and
marshy lands of the public domain, a policy first enunciated in 1907 in Act No.
1654.  Government reclaimed, foreshore
and marshy lands remained 
sui generis
, as the only alienable or
disposable lands of the public domain that the government could not sell to
private parties.


The rationale
behind this State policy is obvious.   Government reclaimed, foreshore and marshy public lands for
non-agricultural purposes retain their inherent potential as areas for public
service.  This is the reason the government
prohibited the sale, and only allowed the lease, of these lands to private
parties.  The State always reserved
these lands for some future public service.


Act No. 2874 did
not authorize the reclassification of government reclaimed, foreshore and
marshy lands into other non-agricultural lands under Section 56 (d).  Lands falling under Section 56 (d) were the
only lands for non-agricultural purposes the government could sell to private
parties.  Thus, under Act No. 2874, the
government could not sell government reclaimed, foreshore and marshy lands to
private parties, 
unless the legislature passed a law allowing their sale
.
[49]


Act No. 2874 did
not prohibit private parties from reclaiming parts of the sea pursuant to
Section 5 of the Spanish Law of Waters of 1866.  Lands reclaimed from the sea by private parties with government
permission remained private lands.


Dispositions under the 1935 Constitution


On May 14, 1935,
the 1935 Constitution took effect upon its ratification by the Filipino people.
The 1935 Constitution, in adopting the Regalian doctrine, declared in Section
1, Article XIII, that â


âSection 1.  All agricultural, timber, and mineral lands
of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral
oils, all forces of potential energy and other natural resources of the
Philippines belong to the State, and their disposition, exploitation,
development, or utilization shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines or
to corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of the capital of
which is owned by such citizens, subject to any existing right, grant, lease,
or concession at the time of the inauguration of the Government established
under this Constitution.  
Natural
resources, with the exception of public agricultural land, shall not be
alienated
, and  no license,
concession, or lease for the exploitation, development, or utilization of any
of the natural resources shall be granted for a period exceeding twenty-five
years, renewable for another twenty-five years, except as to water rights for
irrigation, water supply, fisheries, or industrial uses other than the
development of water power, in which cases beneficial use may be the measure
and limit of the grant.â  (Emphasis
supplied)


The 1935
Constitution barred the alienation of all natural resources except public
agricultural lands, which were the only natural resources the State could
alienate.  Thus, foreshore lands,
considered part of the Stateâs natural resources, became inalienable by
constitutional fiat, available only for lease for 25 years, renewable for
another 25 years.  The government could alienate
foreshore lands only after these lands were reclaimed and classified as
alienable agricultural lands of the public domain.  Government reclaimed and marshy lands of the public domain, being
neither timber nor mineral lands, fell under the classification of public
agricultural lands.
[50]
 However,
government reclaimed and marshy lands, although subject to classification as
disposable public agricultural lands, could only be leased and not sold to
private parties because of Act No. 2874.


The prohibition on
private parties from acquiring ownership of government reclaimed and marshy
lands of the public domain was only a statutory prohibition and the legislature
could therefore remove such prohibition.  The 1935 Constitution did not prohibit individuals and corporations from
acquiring government reclaimed and marshy lands of the public domain that were
classified as agricultural lands under existing public land laws.  Section 2, Article XIII of the 1935
Constitution provided as follows:


âSection 2.  
No private corporation or association
may acquire, lease, or hold public agricultural lands in excess of one thousand
and twenty four hectares, nor may any individual acquire such lands by purchase
in excess of one hundred and forty hectares
, or by lease in excess of
one thousand and twenty-four hectares, or by homestead in excess of twenty-four
hectares.  Lands adapted to grazing, not
exceeding two thousand hectares, may be leased to an individual, private
corporation, or association.â  (Emphasis supplied)


Still, after the effectivity of the 1935 Constitution, the legislature
did not repeal Section 58 of Act No. 2874 to open for sale to private parties
government reclaimed and marshy lands of the public domain.  On the contrary, the legislature continued
the long established State policy of retaining for the government title and
ownership of government reclaimed and marshy lands of the public domain.


Commonwealth Act No. 141 of the Philippine National Assembly


On November 7,
1936, the National Assembly approved Commonwealth Act No. 141, also known as
the Public Land Act, which compiled the then existing laws on lands of the
public domain.  CA No. 141, as amended,
remains to this day the 
existing general law
 governing the
classification and disposition of lands of the public domain other than timber
and mineral lands.
[51]


Section 6 of CA
No. 141 empowers the President to classify lands of the public domain into
âalienable or disposableâ
[52]
 lands of
the public domain, which prior to such classification are inalienable and outside
the commerce of man.  Section 7 of CA
No. 141 authorizes the President to âdeclare what lands are open to disposition
or concession.â Section 8 of CA No. 141 states that the government can declare
open for disposition or concession only lands that are âofficially delimited
and classified.â Sections 6, 7 and 8 of CA No. 141 read as follows:


âSec. 6.  
The
President
, 
upon the recommendation of the Secretary of
Agriculture and Commerce
, 
shall from time to time classify the
lands of the public domain into â


(a)
Alienable or disposable,


(b)
Timber, and


(c)
Mineral lands,


and may at any time and in like manner transfer such lands from one
class to another,
[53]
 for the purpose of their
administration and disposition.


Sec. 7.  For the purposes of the administration and disposition of
alienable or disposable public lands, 
the President, upon recommendation
by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce
, 
shall from time to
time declare what lands are open to disposition or concession
 under
this Act.


Sec. 8.  
Only those lands shall be declared open to disposition or
concession which have been
 
officially delimited and classified

and, when practicable, surveyed, and 
which have not been reserved for
public or quasi-public uses
, nor appropriated by the Government, nor in
any manner become private property, nor those on which a private right
authorized and recognized by this Act or any other valid law may be claimed, or
which, having been reserved or appropriated, have ceased to be so.  x x x.â


Thus, before the government could alienate or dispose of lands of the
public domain, the President must first officially classify these lands as
alienable or disposable, and then declare them open to disposition or
concession.  There must be no law
reserving these lands for public or quasi-public uses.


The salient
provisions of CA No. 141, on government reclaimed, foreshore and marshy lands
of the public domain, are as follows:


âSec. 58.  
Any tract of land of the public domain
 
which,
being neither timber nor mineral land, is intended to be used for residential
purposes or for commercial, industrial, or other productive purposes other than
agricultural, and is open to disposition or concession, shall be disposed of
under the provisions of this chapter and not otherwise
.


Sec. 59.  
The
lands disposable under this title shall be classified as follows:


(a)
 
Lands reclaimed by the Government by dredging,
filling, or other means;


(b)
Foreshore
;


(c)
Marshy lands
 or lands covered
with water bordering upon the shores or banks of navigable lakes or rivers;


(d) Lands
not included in any of the foregoing classes.


Sec. 60.  Any tract of land comprised under this title may be leased or
sold, as the case may be, to any person, corporation, or association authorized
to purchase or lease public lands for agricultural purposes.  x x x.  


Sec. 61.  
The lands comprised in classes (a), (b), and (c) of section
fifty-nine shall be disposed of to private parties by lease only and not
otherwise
, as soon as 
the President
, upon recommendation
by the Secretary of Agriculture, 
shall declare that the same are not
necessary for the public service
 and are open to disposition under this
chapter.  
The lands included in
class (d) may be disposed of by sale or lease under the provisions of this Act
.â  (Emphasis supplied)


Section 61 of CA
No. 141 
readopted
, after the effectivity of the 1935
Constitution, Section 58 of Act No. 2874 prohibiting the sale of government
reclaimed, foreshore and marshy disposable lands of the public domain.  All these lands are intended for
residential, commercial, industrial or other non-agricultural purposes.  As before, Section 61 allowed only the 
lease

of such lands to private parties.  The
government could sell to private parties only lands falling under Section 59
(d) of CA No. 141, or those lands for non-agricultural purposes not classified
as government reclaimed, foreshore and marshy disposable lands of the public
domain.  Foreshore lands, however,
became inalienable under the 1935 Constitution which only allowed the lease of
these lands to qualified private parties.


Section 58 of CA
No. 141 expressly states that disposable lands of the public domain intended
for residential, commercial, industrial or other productive purposes other than
agricultural â
shall be disposed of under the provisions of this chapter
and not otherwise
.â Under Section 10 of CA No. 141, the term
âdispositionâ includes lease of the land.  Any disposition of government reclaimed, foreshore and marshy disposable
lands for non-agricultural purposes must comply with Chapter IX, Title III of
CA No. 141,
[54]
 unless a
subsequent law amended or repealed these provisions.


In his
concurring opinion in the landmark case of 
Republic Real Estate
Corporation v. Court of Appeals
,
[55]
 Justice
Reynato S. Puno summarized succinctly the law on this matter, as follows:


âForeshore
lands are lands of public dominion intended for public use.  So too are lands reclaimed by the government
by dredging, filling, or other means.  Act 1654 mandated that the control and disposition of the foreshore and
lands under water remained in the national government.  Said law allowed only the âleasingâ  of reclaimed land.  The Public Land Acts of 1919 and 1936 also declared that the
foreshore and lands reclaimed by the government were to be âdisposed of to
private parties by lease only and not otherwise.â Before leasing, however, the
Governor-General, upon recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources, had first to determine that the land reclaimed was not
necessary for the public service.  This
requisite must have been met before the land could be disposed of.  
But even then, the foreshore and lands
under water were not to be alienated and sold to private parties. The
disposition of the reclaimed land was only by lease.  The land remained property of the State.â
 (Emphasis
supplied)


As observed by Justice Puno in his concurring opinion, âCommonwealth Act
No. 141 has remained in effect at present.â


The State policy
prohibiting the sale to private parties of government reclaimed, foreshore and
marshy alienable lands of the public domain, first implemented in 1907 was thus
reaffirmed in CA No. 141 after the 1935 Constitution took effect.  The prohibition on the sale of foreshore
lands, however, became a constitutional edict under the 1935 Constitution.
Foreshore lands became inalienable as natural resources of the State, unless
reclaimed by the government and classified as agricultural lands of the public domain,
in which case they would fall under the classification of government reclaimed
lands.


After the
effectivity of the 1935 Constitution, government reclaimed and marshy
disposable lands of the public domain continued to be only leased and not sold
to private parties.
[56]
 These
lands remained 
sui generis
, as the only alienable or disposable
lands of the public domain the government could not sell to private parties. 


Since then and
until now, the only way the government can sell to private parties government
reclaimed and marshy disposable lands of the public domain is for the
legislature to pass a law authorizing such sale.  CA No. 141 does not authorize the President to reclassify
government reclaimed and marshy lands into other non-agricultural lands under
Section 59 (d). Lands classified under Section 59 (d) are the only alienable or
disposable lands for non-agricultural purposes that the government could sell
to private parties.


Moreover,
Section 60 of CA No. 141 
expressly
 requires congressional authority
before lands under Section 59 that the government previously transferred to
government units or entities could be sold to private parties.  Section 60 of CA No. 141 declares that â


âSec. 60. x x x The area so leased
or sold shall be such as shall, in the judgment of the Secretary of Agriculture
and Natural Resources, be reasonably necessary for the purposes for which such
sale or lease is requested, and shall not exceed one hundred and forty-four
hectares: Provided, however, That this limitation shall not apply to grants,
donations, or transfers made to a province, municipality or branch or
subdivision of the Government for the purposes deemed by said entities
conducive to the public interest; 
but the land so granted, donated, or
transferred to a province, municipality or branch or subdivision of the
Government shall not be alienated, encumbered, or otherwise disposed of in a
manner affecting its title, except when authorized by Congress: 
x x x.â
(Emphasis supplied)


The congressional authority required in Section 60 of CA No. 141 mirrors
the legislative authority required in Section 56 of Act No. 2874.


One reason for
the congressional authority is that Section 60 of CA No. 141 exempted
government units and entities from the maximum area of public lands that could
be acquired from the State.  These
government units and entities should not just turn around and sell these lands
to private parties in violation of constitutional or statutory limitations.  Otherwise, the transfer of lands for
non-agricultural purposes to government units and entities could be used to
circumvent constitutional limitations on ownership of alienable or disposable
lands of the public domain.  In the same
manner, such transfers could also be used to evade the statutory prohibition in
CA No. 141 on the sale of government reclaimed and marshy lands of the public
domain to private parties.  Section 60
of CA No. 141 constitutes by operation of law a lien on these lands.
[57]


In case of 
sale
or lease 
of disposable lands of the public domain falling under Section
59 of CA No. 141, Sections 63 and 67 require a 
public bidding.  
Sections 63 and 67 of CA No. 141
provide as follows:


âSec. 63.  Whenever it is decided that lands covered by this chapter are not
needed for public purposes, the Director of Lands shall ask the Secretary of
Agriculture and Commerce (now the Secretary of Natural Resources) for authority
to dispose of the same.  Upon receipt of
such authority, the Director of Lands shall give notice by public advertisement
in the same manner as in the case of leases or sales of agricultural public
land, x x x.


Sec. 67.  
The lease or sale shall be made by oral bidding; and
adjudication shall be made to the highest bidder
. x x x.â  (Emphasis supplied)


Thus, CA No. 141 mandates the Government to put to public auction all
leases or sales of alienable or disposable lands of the public domain.
[58]


Like Act No.
1654 and Act No. 2874 before it, CA No. 141 did not repeal Section 5 of the
Spanish Law of Waters of 1866.   Private
parties could still reclaim portions of the sea with government
permission.  However, the 
reclaimed
land could become private land only if classified as alienable agricultural
land of the public domain
 open to disposition under CA No. 141. The 1935
Constitution prohibited the alienation of all natural resources except public
agricultural lands.


The Civil Code of 1950


The Civil Code
of 1950 readopted substantially the definition of property of public dominion
found in the Civil Code of 1889.  Articles
420 and 422 of the Civil Code of 1950 state that â


âArt. 420.  The following things are property of public dominion:


(1)
 
Those intended for public use, such as roads,
canals, rivers, torrents, ports and bridges constructed by the State, banks,
shores, roadsteads, and others of similar character;


(2)
 
Those which belong to the State, without being for public use, and
are intended for some public service or for the development of the national
wealth.


x x x.


Art. 422.  Property of public dominion, when no longer intended for public
use or for public service, shall form part of the patrimonial property of the
State.â


Again, the
government must formally declare that the property of public dominion is no
longer needed for public use or public service, before the same could be
classified as patrimonial property of the State.
[59]
 
In the
case of government reclaimed and marshy lands of the public domain, the
declaration of their being disposable, as well as the manner of their
disposition, is governed by the applicable provisions of CA No. 141.


Like the Civil
Code of 1889, the Civil Code of 1950 included as property of public dominion
those properties of the State which, without being for public use, are intended
for public service or the â
development of the national wealth
.â
Thus, government reclaimed and marshy lands of the State, even if not employed
for public use or public service, if developed to enhance the national wealth,
are classified as property of public dominion.


Dispositions under the 1973 Constitution


The 1973
Constitution, which took effect on January 17, 1973, likewise adopted the
Regalian doctrine.  Section 8, Article
XIV of the 1973 Constitution stated that â


âSec. 8.  All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum
and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, wildlife,
and other natural resources of the Philippines belong to the State.  
With the exception of agricultural,
industrial or commercial, residential, and resettlement lands of the public
domain, natural resources shall not be alienated
, and no license,
concession, or lease for the exploration, development, exploitation, or
utilization of any of the natural resources shall be granted for a period
exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years,
except as to water rights for irrigation, water supply, fisheries, or
industrial uses other than the development of water power, in which cases,
beneficial use may be the measure and the limit of the grant.â  (Emphasis supplied)


The 1973 Constitution
prohibited the alienation of all natural resources with the exception of
âagricultural, industrial or commercial, residential, and resettlement lands of
the public domain.â  In contrast, the
1935 Constitution barred the alienation of all natural resources except âpublic
agricultural lands.â However, the term âpublic agricultural landsâ in the 1935
Constitution encompassed industrial, commercial, residential and resettlement
lands of the public domain.
[60]
 
If the
land of public domain were neither timber nor mineral land, it would fall under
the classification of agricultural land of the public domain.  
Both the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions,
therefore, prohibited the alienation of all natural resources except
agricultural lands of the public domain
.   


The 1973
Constitution, however, limited the alienation of lands of the public domain to
individuals who were citizens of the Philippines.  Private corporations, even if wholly owned by Philippine
citizens, were no longer allowed to acquire alienable lands of the public
domain unlike in the 1935 Constitution.  Section 11, Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution declared that â 


âSec. 11.  The Batasang Pambansa, taking into account conservation,
ecological, and development requirements of the natural resources, shall
determine by law the size of land of the public domain which may be developed,
held or acquired by, or leased to, any qualified individual, corporation, or
association, and the conditions therefor.  
No private corporation or association may hold alienable lands of
the public domain except by lease 
not to exceed one thousand hectares
in area nor may any citizen hold such lands by lease in excess of five hundred
hectares or acquire by purchase, homestead or grant, in excess of twenty-four
hectares.  No private corporation or
association may hold by lease, concession, license or permit, timber or forest
lands and other timber or forest resources in excess of one hundred thousand
hectares. However, such area may be increased by the Batasang Pambansa upon
recommendation of the National Economic and Development Authority.â  (Emphasis supplied)


Thus, under the
1973 Constitution, private corporations could hold alienable lands of the
public domain only through lease.  Only
individuals could now acquire alienable lands of the public domain, and 
private
corporations became absolutely barred from acquiring any kind of alienable land
of the public domain
.  The
constitutional ban extended to all kinds of alienable lands of the public
domain, while the statutory ban under CA No. 141 applied only to government
reclaimed, foreshore and marshy alienable lands of the public domain.


PD No. 1084 Creating the Public Estates Authority


On February 4,
1977, then President Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 1084 creating
PEA, a wholly government owned and controlled corporation with a special
charter.  Sections 4 and 8 of PD No.
1084, vests PEA with the following purposes and powers:


âSec. 4.  Purpose.  The Authority is hereby
created for the following purposes: 


(a) 
To
reclaim land, including foreshore and submerged areas
, 
by
dredging, filling or other means, or to acquire reclaimed land;


(b) To
develop, improve, acquire, administer, deal in, subdivide, dispose, 
lease
and sell any and all kinds of lands
, buildings, estates and other forms
of real property, owned, managed, controlled and/or operated by the government;


(c) To
provide for, operate or administer such service as may be necessary for the
efficient, economical and beneficial utilization of the above properties.


Sec. 5.  Powers and functions of the Authority.  The Authority shall, in carrying out the purposes for which it is
created, have the following powers and functions:


(a)To prescribe its by-laws.


  x x x 


(i) 
To hold lands of the public domain 
in
excess of the area permitted to private corporations by statute.


(j) 
To reclaim lands
 and to construct
work across, or otherwise, any stream, watercourse, canal, ditch, flume x x
x.  


x x x


(o) To perform such acts and exercise such functions as may be necessary
for the attainment of the purposes and objectives herein specified.â (Emphasis
supplied)


PD No. 1084
authorizes PEA to reclaim both foreshore and submerged areas of the public
domain.  Foreshore areas are those
covered and uncovered by the ebb and flow of the tide.
[61]
 
Submerged
areas are those permanently under water regardless of the ebb and flow of the
tide.
[62]
 
Foreshore
and submerged areas indisputably belong to the public domain
[63]
 and are
inalienable unless reclaimed, classified as alienable lands open to
disposition, and further declared no longer needed for public service.


The ban in the
1973 Constitution on private corporations from acquiring alienable lands of the
public domain did not apply to PEA since it was then, and until today, a fully
owned government corporation.  The
constitutional ban applied then, as it still applies now, only to âprivate
corporations and associations.â  PD No.
1084 expressly empowers PEA â
to
 
hold lands of the public
domainâ 
even
 
âin excess of the area permitted to private
corporations by statute.â  
Thus,
PEA can hold title to private lands, as well as title to lands of the public
domain
.


In order for PEA
to 
sell
 its reclaimed foreshore and submerged alienable lands of
the public domain, there must be legislative authority empowering PEA to sell
these lands.  This legislative authority
is necessary in view of Section 60 of CA No.141, which states â


âSec. 60.
x x x; but the land so granted, donated or transferred to a province,
municipality, or branch or subdivision of the Government shall not be
alienated, encumbered or otherwise disposed of in a manner affecting its title,

except when authorized by Congress
; x x x.â (Emphasis supplied)


Without such legislative authority, PEA could not sell but only lease
its reclaimed foreshore and submerged alienable lands of the public
domain.  Nevertheless, any legislative
authority granted to PEA to sell its reclaimed alienable lands of the public
domain would be subject to the constitutional ban on private corporations from
acquiring alienable lands of the public domain. Hence, such legislative
authority could only benefit private individuals.


Dispositions under the 1987 Constitution 


The 1987
Constitution, like the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions before it, has adopted the
Regalian doctrine.  The 1987
Constitution declares that all natural resources are â
owned by the State
,â
and except for alienable agricultural lands of the public domain, natural
resources cannot be alienated.  Sections 2 and 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution state that â


âSection 2.  All lands of the public domain, waters,
minerals, coal, petroleum and other mineral oils, all forces of potential
energy, fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other natural
resources 
are owned by the State
.  
With the exception of agricultural lands, all other natural
resources shall not be alienated. 
  The exploration, development, and utilization of natural
resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State. x x x.


Section 3.  Lands of the public domain are classified
into agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands, and national parks.  Agricultural lands of the public domain may
be further classified by law according to the uses which they may be
devoted.  
Alienable lands of the
public domain shall be limited to agricultural lands. Private corporations or
associations may not hold such alienable lands of the public domain except by
lease, for a period not exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more
than twenty-five years, and not to exceed one thousand hectares in area
.
Citizens of the Philippines may lease not more than five hundred hectares, or
acquire not more than twelve hectares thereof by purchase, homestead, or grant.



Taking into account the
requirements of conservation, ecology, and development, and subject to the
requirements of agrarian reform, the Congress shall determine, by law, the size
of lands of the public domain which may be acquired, developed, held, or leased
and the conditions therefor.â  (Emphasis supplied)


The 1987
Constitution continues the State policy in the 1973 Constitution banning
private corporations from acquiring 
any kind of alienable land of the
public domain
.  Like the 1973
Constitution, the 1987 Constitution allows private corporations to hold
alienable lands of the public domain 
only through lease
.  As in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions, the
general law governing the lease to private corporations of reclaimed, foreshore
and marshy alienable lands of the public domain is still CA No. 141. 


The Rationale behind the Constitutional Ban


The rationale
behind the constitutional ban on corporations from acquiring, except through
lease, alienable lands of the public domain is not well understood.  During the deliberations of the 1986
Constitutional Commission, the commissioners probed the rationale behind this
ban, thus:


âFR.
BERNAS:  Mr. Vice-President, my
questions have reference to page 3, line 5 which says:


`No private corporation or association may hold alienable lands of the
public domain except by lease, not to exceed one thousand hectares in area.â


If we
recall, this provision did not exist under the 1935 Constitution, but this was
introduced in the 1973 Constitution.  In
effect, it prohibits private corporations from acquiring alienable public
lands.  
But it has not been very
clear in jurisprudence what the reason for this is
.  In some of the cases decided in 1982 and
1983, 
it was indicated that the purpose of this is to prevent large
landholdings
.  Is that the
intent of this provision?


MR.
VILLEGAS:  I think that is the spirit of
the provision.


FR.
BERNAS:  In existing decisions involving
the Iglesia ni Cristo, there were instances where the Iglesia ni Cristo was not
allowed to acquire a mere 313-square meter land where a chapel stood because
the Supreme Court said it would be in violation of this.â  (Emphasis supplied)


In 
Ayog v.
Cusi
,
[64]
 
the Court
explained the rationale behind this constitutional ban in this way:


âIndeed,
one purpose of the constitutional prohibition against purchases of public
agricultural lands by private corporations is to equitably diffuse land
ownership or to encourage âowner-cultivatorship and the economic family-size
farmâ and to prevent a recurrence of cases like the instant case.  Huge landholdings by corporations or private
persons had spawned social unrest.â


However, if the constitutional intent is to prevent huge landholdings,
the Constitution could have simply limited the size of alienable lands of the
public domain that corporations could acquire.  The Constitution could have followed the limitations on individuals, who
could acquire not more than 24 hectares of alienable lands of the public domain
under the 1973 Constitution, and not more than 12 hectares under the 1987
Constitution.


If the
constitutional intent is to encourage economic family-size farms, placing the
land in the name of a corporation would be more effective in preventing the
break-up of farmlands.  If the farmland
is registered in the name of a corporation, upon the death of the owner, his
heirs would inherit shares in the corporation instead of subdivided parcels of
the farmland.  This would prevent the
continuing break-up of farmlands into smaller and smaller plots from one
generation to the next.


In actual
practice, the constitutional ban strengthens the constitutional limitation on
individuals from acquiring more than the allowed area of alienable lands of the
public domain.  Without the
constitutional ban, individuals who already acquired the maximum area of
alienable lands of the public domain could easily set up corporations to
acquire more alienable public lands.  An
individual could own as many corporations as his means would allow him.  An individual could even hide his ownership
of a corporation by putting his nominees as stockholders of the
corporation.  The corporation is a
convenient vehicle to circumvent the constitutional limitation on acquisition
by individuals of alienable lands of the public domain.


The
constitutional intent, under the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions, is to transfer
ownership of only a limited area of alienable land of the public domain to a
qualified individual.  This
constitutional intent is safeguarded by the provision prohibiting corporations
from acquiring alienable lands of the public domain, since the vehicle to
circumvent the constitutional intent is removed.  The available alienable public lands are gradually decreasing in
the face of an ever-growing population.  The most effective way to insure faithful adherence to this
constitutional intent is to grant or sell alienable lands of the public domain
only to individuals.  This, it would
seem, is the practical benefit arising from the constitutional ban.


The Amended Joint Venture Agreement 


The subject
matter of the Amended JVA, as stated in its second Whereas clause, consists of
three properties, namely:


1. â[T]hree partially reclaimed and substantially
eroded islands along Emilio Aguinaldo Boulevard in Paranaque and Las Pinas,
Metro Manila, with a combined titled area of 1,578,441 square meters;â


2.
â[A]nother area of 2,421,559 square meters contiguous to the three islands;â
and


3. â[A]t
AMARIâs option as approved by PEA, an additional 350 hectares more or less to
regularize the configuration of the reclaimed area.â
[65]


PEA confirms that the Amended JVA involves âthe development of the
Freedom Islands and further reclamation of about 250 hectares x x x,â plus an
option âgranted to AMARI to subsequently reclaim another 350 hectares x x x.â
[66]


In short, the
Amended JVA covers a reclamation area of 750 hectares.  
Only 157.84 hectares of the
750-hectare reclamation project have been  reclaimed, and the rest of the 592.15 hectares are still submerged areas
forming part of Manila Bay
.


Under the
Amended JVA, AMARI will reimburse PEA the sum of 
P
1,894,129,200.00 for
PEAâs âactual costâ in partially reclaiming the Freedom Islands. AMARI will
also complete, at its own expense, the reclamation of the Freedom Islands.  AMARI will further shoulder all the reclamation
costs of all the other areas, totaling 592.15 hectares, still to be
reclaimed.  AMARI and PEA will share, in
the proportion of 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively, the total net usable
area which is defined in the Amended JVA as the total reclaimed area less 30
percent earmarked for common areas.  Title to AMARIâs share in the net usable area, totaling 367.5 hectares,
will be issued in the name of AMARI.  Section 5.2 (c) of the Amended JVA provides that â


âx x x,
PEA shall have the duty to execute without delay the necessary deed of transfer
or conveyance of the title pertaining to AMARIâs Land share based on the Land
Allocation Plan. 
PEA, when requested in writing by AMARI, shall then
cause the issuance and delivery of the proper certificates of title covering
AMARIâs Land Share in the name of AMARI,
 x x x; provided, that if more
than seventy percent (70%) of the titled area at any given time pertains to
AMARI, PEA shall deliver to AMARI only seventy percent (70%) of the titles
pertaining to AMARI, until such time when a corresponding proportionate area of
additional land pertaining to PEA has been titled.â  (Emphasis supplied)


Indisputably, under the Amended JVA AMARI will acquire and
own a maximum of 367.5 hectares of reclaimed land which will be titled in its
name.


To implement the
Amended JVA, PEA delegated to the unincorporated PEA-AMARI joint venture PEAâs
statutory authority, rights and privileges to reclaim foreshore and submerged
areas in Manila Bay.  Section 3.2.a of
the Amended JVA states that â


âPEA
hereby contributes to the joint venture its rights and privileges to perform
Rawland Reclamation and Horizontal Development as well as own the Reclamation
Area, thereby granting the Joint Venture the full and exclusive right,
authority and privilege to undertake the Project in accordance with the Master
Development Plan.â


The Amended JVA is the product of a renegotiation of the original JVA
dated April 25, 1995 and its supplemental agreement dated August 9, 1995.


The Threshold Issue


The threshold
issue is whether AMARI, a private corporation, can acquire and own under the
Amended JVA 367.5 hectares of reclaimed foreshore and submerged areas in Manila
Bay in view of Sections 2 and 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution which
state that:


âSection 2.  All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and
other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, forests or
timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other natural resources are owned by the
State.  
With the exception of
agricultural lands, all other natural resources shall not be alienated
.

Section 3. x x x Alienable lands of
the public domain shall be limited to agricultural lands.  
Private corporations or associations
may not hold such alienable lands of the public domain except by lease
,

Classification of Reclaimed
Foreshore and Submerged Areas


PEA readily
concedes that lands reclaimed from foreshore or submerged areas of Manila Bay
are alienable or disposable lands of the public domain.  In its Memorandum,
[67]
 PEA
admits that â


âUnder the
Public Land Act (CA 141, as amended), 
reclaimed lands are classified as
alienable and disposable lands of the public domain:


âSec. 59.  The lands disposable under this title shall be classified as
follows:


(a)
     
Lands
reclaimed by the government by dredging, filling, or other means;


x x x.ââ
(Emphasis supplied)


Likewise, the
Legal Task Force
[68]
 
constituted
under Presidential Administrative Order No. 365 admitted in its Report and
Recommendation to then President Fidel V. Ramos, â
[R]eclaimed lands are
classified as alienable and disposable lands of the public domain
.â
[69]
 The Legal
Task Force concluded that â


âD.
Conclusion 


Reclaimed lands are lands of the
public domain. However, by statutory authority, the rights of ownership and
disposition over reclaimed lands have been transferred to PEA, by virtue of
which PEA, as owner, may validly convey the same to any qualified person
without violating the Constitution or any statute.


The constitutional provision
prohibiting private corporations from holding public land, except by lease
(Sec. 3, Art. XVII,
[70]
 1987 Constitution), does
not apply to reclaimed lands whose ownership has passed on to PEA by statutory
grant.â


Under Section 2,
Article XII of the 1987 Constitution, the foreshore and submerged areas of
Manila Bay are part of  the âlands of
the public domain, waters x x x and other natural resourcesâ and consequently
âowned by the State.â As such, foreshore and submerged areas âshall not be
alienated,â unless they are classified as âagricultural landsâ of the public
domain.  The mere reclamation of these
areas by PEA does not convert these inalienable natural resources of the State
into alienable or disposable lands of the public domain.  There must be a law or presidential
proclamation officially classifying these reclaimed lands as alienable or
disposable and open to disposition or concession.  Moreover, these reclaimed lands cannot be classified as alienable
or disposable if the law has reserved them for some public or quasi-public use.
[71]


Section 8 of CA
No. 141 provides that âonly those lands shall be declared open to disposition
or concession which have been 
officially delimited and classified
.â
[72]
 
The
President has the authority to classify inalienable lands of the public domain
into alienable or disposable lands of the public domain, pursuant to Section 6
of CA No. 141.  In 
Laurel vs.
Garcia
,
[73]
 
the
Executive Department attempted to sell the Roppongi property in Tokyo, Japan,
which was acquired by the Philippine Government for use as the Chancery of the
Philippine Embassy.  Although the
Chancery had transferred to another location thirteen years earlier, the Court
still ruled that, under Article 422
[74]
 of the
Civil Code, a property of public dominion retains such character until 
formally
declared
 otherwise.  The Court
ruled that â


âThe fact
that the Roppongi site has not been used for a long time for actual Embassy
service does not automatically convert it to patrimonial property.  Any such conversion happens only if the
property is withdrawn from public use (Cebu Oxygen and Acetylene Co. v.
Bercilles, 66 SCRA 481 [1975].
  A
property continues to be part of the public domain, not available for private
appropriation or ownership âuntil there is a formal declaration on the part of
the government to withdraw it from being suchâ
 (Ignacio v. Director of
Lands, 108 Phil. 335 [1960].â (Emphasis supplied)


PD No. 1085,
issued on February 4, 1977, authorized the issuance of special land patents for
lands reclaimed by PEA from the foreshore or submerged areas of Manila
Bay.  On January 19, 1988 then President
Corazon C. Aquino issued Special Patent No. 3517 in the name of PEA for the
157.84 hectares comprising the partially reclaimed Freedom Islands.  Subsequently, on April 9, 1999 the Register
of Deeds of the Municipality of Paranaque issued TCT Nos. 7309, 7311 and 7312
in the name of PEA pursuant to Section 103 of PD No. 1529 authorizing the
issuance of certificates of title corresponding to land patents. To this day,
these certificates of title are still in the name of PEA.


PD No. 1085,
coupled with President Aquinoâs 
actual issuance
 of a special
patent covering the Freedom Islands, is equivalent to an official proclamation
classifying the Freedom Islands as alienable or disposable lands of the public
domain.  PD No. 1085 and President
Aquinoâs issuance of a land patent also constitute a declaration that the
Freedom Islands are no longer needed for public service.  
The Freedom Islands are thus alienable
or disposable lands of the public domain, open to disposition or concession to
qualified parties.


At the time then
President Aquino issued Special Patent No. 3517, PEA had already reclaimed the
Freedom Islands although subsequently there were partial erosions on some
areas. The government had also completed the necessary surveys on these
islands.  Thus, the Freedom Islands were
no longer part of Manila Bay but part of the land mass.  Section 3, Article XII of the 1987
Constitution classifies lands of the public domain into âagricultural, forest
or timber, mineral lands, and national parks.â Being neither timber, mineral,
nor national park lands, the reclaimed Freedom Islands necessarily fall under
the classification of agricultural lands of the public domain.  Under the 1987 Constitution, agricultural
lands of the public domain are the only natural resources that the State may
alienate to qualified private parties.  All other natural resources, such as the seas or bays, are âwaters x x x
owned by the Stateâ forming part of the public domain, and are inalienable
pursuant to Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution.


AMARI claims
that the Freedom Islands are private lands because CDCP, then a private
corporation, reclaimed the islands under a contract dated November 20, 1973
with the Commissioner of Public Highways.  AMARI, citing Article 5 of the Spanish Law of Waters of 1866, argues
that âif the ownership of reclaimed lands may be given to the party
constructing the works, then it cannot be said that reclaimed lands are lands
of the public domain which the State may not alienate.â
[75]
 
Article 5
of the Spanish Law of Waters reads as follows:


âArticle 5. Lands reclaimed from
the sea in consequence of works constructed by the State, or by the provinces,
pueblos or private persons, 
with proper permission
, shall become
the property of the party constructing such works, 
unless otherwise
provided by the terms of the grant of authority
.â (Emphasis supplied)


Under Article 5
of the Spanish Law of Waters of 1866, private parties could reclaim from the
sea only with âproper permissionâ from the State.  Private parties could own the reclaimed land only if not
âotherwise provided by the terms of the grant of authority.â This clearly meant
that no one could reclaim from the sea without permission from the State
because the sea is property of public dominion.  It also meant that the State could grant or withhold ownership of
the reclaimed land because any reclaimed land, like the sea from which it
emerged, belonged to the State.  Thus, a
private person reclaiming from the sea without permission from the State could
not acquire ownership of the reclaimed land which would remain property of
public dominion like the sea it replaced.
[76]
 
Article 5
of the Spanish Law of Waters of 1866 adopted the time-honored principle of land
ownership that âall lands that were not acquired from the government, either by
purchase or by grant, belong to the public domain.â
[77]


Article 5 of the
Spanish Law of Waters must be read together with laws subsequently enacted on
the disposition of public lands.  In
particular, CA No. 141 requires that lands of the public domain must first be
classified as alienable or disposable before the government can alienate them.  These lands must not be reserved for public
or quasi-public purposes.
[78]
 Moreover,
the contract between CDCP and the government was executed 
after 
the
effectivity of the 1973 Constitution which barred private corporations from
acquiring any kind of alienable land of the public domain.  This contract could not have converted the
Freedom Islands into private lands of a private corporation.


Presidential
Decree No. 3-A, issued on January 11, 1973, revoked all laws authorizing the
reclamation of areas under water and revested solely in the National Government
the power to reclaim lands.  Section 1
of PD No. 3-A  declared that â


â
The provisions of any law to
the contrary notwithstanding
, the reclamation of areas under water,
whether foreshore or inland, shall be 
limited to the National Government
or any person authorized by it under a proper contract
. (Emphasis
supplied)


x x x.â


PD No. 3-A repealed Section 5 of the Spanish Law of Waters of 1866
because reclamation of areas under water could now be undertaken only by the National
Government or by a person contracted by the National Government.  Private parties may reclaim from the sea
only under a contract with the National Government, and no longer by grant or
permission as provided in Section 5 of the Spanish Law of Waters of 1866.


Executive Order
No. 525, issued on February 14, 1979, designated PEA as the National
Governmentâs implementing arm to undertake âall reclamation projects of the
government,â which â
shall be undertaken by the PEA or through a proper
contract executed by it with any person or entity
.â Under such
contract, a private party receives compensation for reclamation services
rendered to PEA.  Payment to the
contractor may be in cash, or in kind consisting of portions of the reclaimed
land, subject to the constitutional ban on private corporations from acquiring
alienable lands of the public domain.  The reclaimed land can be used as payment in kind only if the reclaimed
land is first classified as alienable or disposable land open to disposition,
and then declared no longer needed for public service.


The Amended JVA
covers not only the Freedom Islands, but also an additional 592.15 hectares
which are still submerged and forming part of Manila Bay.  
There is no legislative or
Presidential act classifying these submerged areas as alienable or disposable
lands of the public domain open to disposition
.  These submerged areas are not covered by any
patent or certificate of title.
 
  There can be no dispute that these submerged areas form part of
the public domain, and in their present state are 
inalienable
 
and
outside the commerce of man
.  Until reclaimed from the sea, these submerged areas are, under the
Constitution, âwaters x x x owned by the State,â forming part of the public
domain and consequently inalienable.  Only when actually reclaimed from the sea can these submerged areas be
classified as public agricultural lands, which under the Constitution are the
only natural resources that the State may alienate.  Once reclaimed and transformed into public agricultural lands,
the government may then officially classify these lands as alienable or
disposable lands open to disposition.  Thereafter, the government may declare these lands no longer needed for
public service.  Only then can these
reclaimed lands be considered alienable or disposable lands of the public
domain and within the commerce of man.


The
classification of PEAâs reclaimed foreshore and submerged lands into alienable
or disposable lands open to disposition is necessary because PEA is tasked
under its charter to undertake public services that require the use of lands of
the public domain.  Under Section 5 of
PD No. 1084, the functions of PEA include the following: â[T]o own or operate
railroads, tramways and other kinds of land transportation, x x x; [T]o
construct, maintain and operate such systems of sanitary sewers as may be
necessary; [T]o construct, maintain and operate such storm drains as may be
necessary.â  PEA is empowered to issue
ârules and regulations as may be necessary for the proper use by private
parties of 
any or all of the highways, roads, utilities, buildings and/or
any of its properties
 and to impose or collect fees or tolls for their
use.â  Thus, part of the reclaimed
foreshore and submerged lands held by the PEA would actually be needed for
public use or service since many of the functions imposed on PEA by its charter
constitute essential public services.


Moreover,
Section 1 of Executive Order No. 525 provides that PEA âshall be primarily
responsible for integrating, directing, and coordinating all reclamation
projects for and on behalf of the National Government.â  The same section also states that â[A]ll
reclamation projects shall be approved by the President upon recommendation of
the PEA, and shall be undertaken by the PEA or through a proper contract
executed by it with any person or entity; x x x.â Thus, under EO No. 525, in
relation to PD No. 3-A and PD No.1084, PEA became the primary implementing
agency of the National Government to reclaim foreshore and submerged lands of
the public domain.  EO No. 525
recognized PEA as the government entity âto undertake the reclamation of lands
and ensure their maximum utilization 
in promoting public welfare and
interests
.â
[79]
 
Since
large portions of these reclaimed lands would obviously be needed for public
service, there must be a formal declaration segregating reclaimed lands no
longer needed for public service from those still needed for public service.


Section 3 of EO
No. 525, by declaring that all lands reclaimed by PEA âshall belong to or be
owned by the PEA,â could not automatically operate to classify inalienable
lands into alienable or disposable lands of the public domain.  Otherwise, reclaimed foreshore and submerged
lands of the public domain would automatically become alienable once reclaimed
by PEA, whether or not classified as alienable or disposable.


The Revised
Administrative Code of 1987, a later law than either PD No. 1084 or EO No. 525,
vests in the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (âDENRâ for
brevity) the following powers and functions:


âSec. 4.  Powers and Functions.  The
Department shall:


(1) x x x


x x x


(4) 
Exercise supervision and control

over forest lands, 
alienable and disposable public lands
, mineral
resources and, in the process of exercising such control, impose appropriate
taxes, fees, charges, rentals and any such form of levy and collect such
revenues for the exploration, development, utilization or gathering of such
resources;


x x x


(14) 
Promulgate
rules, regulations and guidelines on the issuance of licenses, permits,
concessions, lease agreements and such other privileges concerning the
development, exploration and utilization of the countryâs marine, freshwater,
and brackish water and over all aquatic resources of the country and shall
continue to oversee, supervise and police our natural resources
; cancel
or cause to cancel such privileges upon failure, non-compliance or violations
of any regulation, order, and for all other causes which are in furtherance of
the conservation of natural resources and supportive of the national interest;


(15) 
Exercise
exclusive jurisdiction on the management and disposition of all lands of the
public domain and
 
serve as the sole agency responsible for
classification
, sub-classification, surveying and titling of lands in
consultation with appropriate agencies.â
[80]
 (Emphasis supplied)


As manager,
conservator and overseer of the natural resources of the State, DENR exercises
âsupervision and control over alienable and disposable public lands.â  DENR also exercises âexclusive jurisdiction
on the management and disposition of all lands of the public domain.â  Thus, DENR decides whether areas under
water, like foreshore or submerged areas of Manila Bay, should be reclaimed or
not.  This means that PEA needs
authorization from DENR before PEA can undertake reclamation projects in Manila
Bay, or in any part of the country.


DENR also
exercises exclusive jurisdiction over the disposition of all lands of the
public domain.  Hence, DENR decides
whether reclaimed lands of PEA should be classified as alienable under Sections
6
[81]
 
and 7
[82]
 
of CA No.
141.  Once DENR decides that the
reclaimed lands should be so classified, it then recommends to the President
the issuance of a proclamation classifying the lands as alienable or disposable
lands of the public domain open to disposition.  We note that then DENR Secretary Fulgencio S. Factoran, Jr.
countersigned Special Patent No. 3517 in compliance with the Revised
Administrative Code and Sections 6 and 7 of CA No. 141.


In short, DENR
is vested with the power to authorize the reclamation of areas under water,
while PEA is vested with the power to undertake the physical reclamation of
areas under water, whether directly or through private contractors.  DENR is also empowered to classify lands of
the public domain into alienable or disposable lands subject to the approval of
the President.  On the other hand, PEA
is tasked to develop, sell or lease the reclaimed alienable lands of the public
domain.


Clearly, the
mere physical act of reclamation by PEA of foreshore or submerged areas does
not make the reclaimed lands alienable or disposable lands of the public
domain, much less patrimonial lands of PEA.  Likewise, the mere transfer by the National Government of lands of the
public domain to PEA does not make the lands alienable or disposable lands of
the public domain, much less patrimonial lands of PEA.


Absent two
official acts â a classification that these lands are alienable or disposable
and open to disposition and a declaration that these lands are not needed for
public service, lands reclaimed by PEA remain inalienable lands of the public
domain.  Only such an official
classification and formal declaration can convert reclaimed lands into
alienable or disposable lands of the public domain, open to disposition under
the Constitution, Title I and Title III
[83]
 
of CA No. 141 and other applicable
laws.
[84]


PEAâs Authority to Sell Reclaimed Lands 


PEA, like the
Legal Task Force, argues that as alienable or disposable lands of the public domain,
the reclaimed lands shall be disposed of in accordance with CA No. 141, the
Public Land Act.  PEA, citing Section 60
of CA No. 141, admits that reclaimed lands transferred to a branch or
subdivision of the government âshall not be alienated, encumbered, or otherwise
disposed of in a manner affecting its title, 
except when authorized by
Congress
: x x x.â
[85]
 
(Emphasis
by PEA)  


In 
Laurel
vs. Garcia,
[86]
 
the Court
cited Section 48 of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987, which states that
â


âSec. 48.  Official Authorized to Convey Real Property.  Whenever real property of the Government is 
authorized
by law to be conveyed
, the deed of conveyance shall be executed in
behalf of the government by the following: x x x.â 


Thus, the Court concluded that a law is needed to convey any real
property belonging to the Government.  The Court declared that - 


âIt is not
for the President to convey real property of the government on his or her own
sole will.  
Any such conveyance
must be authorized and approved by a law enacted by the Congress
.  It requires executive and legislative
concurrence.â  (Emphasis supplied)


PEA contends
that PD No. 1085 and EO No. 525 constitute the legislative authority allowing
PEA to 
sell
 its reclaimed lands.  PD No. 1085, issued on February 4, 1977, provides that â


â
The land reclaimed in the
foreshore and offshore area of Manila Bay
 pursuant to the contract for
the reclamation and construction of the Manila-Cavite Coastal Road Project
between the Republic of the Philippines and the Construction and Development
Corporation of the Philippines dated November 20, 1973 and/or any other
contract or reclamation covering the same area 
is hereby transferred,
conveyed and assigned to the ownership and administration of the Public Estates
Authority
 established pursuant to PD No. 1084;  Provided, however, That the rights and
interests of the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines
pursuant to the aforesaid contract shall be recognized and respected.


Henceforth, the Public Estates Authority
shall exercise the rights and assume the obligations of the Republic of the
Philippines (Department of Public Highways) arising from, or incident to, the
aforesaid contract between the Republic of the Philippines and the Construction
and Development Corporation of the Philippines.


In consideration of the foregoing
transfer and assignment, the Public Estates Authority shall issue in favor of
the Republic of the Philippines the corresponding shares of stock in said
entity with an issued value of said shares of stock (which) shall be deemed
fully paid and non-assessable.


The Secretary of Public Highways
and the General Manager of the Public Estates Authority shall execute such
contracts or agreements, including appropriate agreements with the Construction
and Development Corporation of the Philippines, as may be necessary to
implement the above.


Special land patent/patents
shall be issued by the Secretary of Natural Resources in favor of the Public
Estates Authority without prejudice to the subsequent transfer to the
contractor or his assignees of such portion or portions of the land reclaimed
or to be reclaimed as provided for in the above-mentioned contract.  On the basis of such patents, the Land
Registration Commission shall issue the corresponding certificate of title
.â (Emphasis supplied)


On the other
hand, Section 3 of EO No. 525, issued on February 14, 1979, provides that - 


âSec. 3.  
All lands reclaimed by PEA shall belong to or be owned by
the PEA
 which shall be responsible for its administration, development,
utilization or disposition in accordance with the provisions of Presidential
Decree No. 1084.  Any and all income
that the PEA may derive from the sale, lease or use of reclaimed lands shall be
used in accordance with the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1084.â


There is no
express authority under either PD No. 1085 or EO No. 525 for PEA to sell its
reclaimed lands. PD No. 1085 merely transferred âownership and administrationâ
of lands reclaimed from Manila Bay to PEA, while EO No. 525 declared that lands
reclaimed by PEA âshall belong to or be owned by PEA.â EO No. 525 expressly
states that PEA should dispose of its reclaimed lands âin accordance with the
provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1084,â the charter of PEA.


PEAâs charter,
however, expressly tasks PEA âto develop, improve, acquire, administer, deal
in, subdivide, dispose, lease and 
sell any and all kinds of lands

x x x owned, managed, controlled and/or operated by the government.â
[87]
 
(Emphasis supplied)  
There is, therefore, legislative
authority granted to PEA to sell its lands, whether patrimonial or alienable
lands of the public domain
.  PEA
may sell to private parties its 
patrimonial properties
 in
accordance with the PEA charter free from constitutional limitations.  The constitutional ban on private
corporations from acquiring alienable lands of the public domain does not apply
to the sale of PEAâs patrimonial lands.


PEA may also
sell its 
alienable or disposable lands of the public domain
 to
private individuals since, with the legislative authority, there is no longer
any statutory prohibition against such sales and the constitutional ban does
not apply to individuals.  PEA, however,
cannot sell 
any
 of its alienable or disposable lands of the
public domain to private corporations since Section 3, Article XII of the 1987
Constitution expressly prohibits such sales.  The legislative authority benefits only individuals.  Private corporations remain barred from
acquiring any kind of alienable land of the public domain, including government
reclaimed lands.


The provision in
PD No. 1085 stating that portions of the reclaimed lands could be transferred
by PEA to the âcontractor or 
his
 assigneesâ (Emphasis supplied)
would not apply to private corporations but only to individuals because of the
constitutional ban.  Otherwise, the
provisions of PD No. 1085 would violate both the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions.


The requirement of public auction in the sale of
reclaimed lands


Assuming the
reclaimed lands of PEA are classified as alienable or disposable lands open to
disposition, and further declared no longer needed for public service, PEA
would have to conduct a public bidding in selling or leasing these lands.  PEA must observe the provisions of Sections
63 and 67 of CA No. 141 requiring public auction, in the absence of a law
exempting PEA from holding a public auction.
[88]
 
Special
Patent No. 3517 expressly states that the patent is issued by authority of the
Constitution and PD No. 1084, âsupplemented by Commonwealth Act No. 141, as
amended.â This is an acknowledgment that the provisions of CA No. 141 apply to
the disposition of reclaimed alienable lands of the public domain unless
otherwise provided by law.  Executive
Order No. 654,
[89]
 
which
authorizes PEA âto determine the kind and manner of payment for the transferâ
of its assets and properties, does not exempt PEA from the requirement of
public auction.  EO No. 654 merely
authorizes PEA to decide the mode of payment, whether in kind and in
installment, but does not authorize PEA to dispense with public auction.


Moreover, under
Section 79 of PD No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code, the
government is required to sell valuable government property through public bidding.  Section 79 of PD No. 1445 mandates that â


âSection  79.  
When government
property
 has become unserviceable for any cause, or 
is no longer
needed
, it shall, upon application of the officer accountable therefor,
be inspected by the head of the agency or his duly authorized representative in
the presence of the auditor concerned and, if found to be valueless or
unsaleable, it may be destroyed in their presence.  
If found to be valuable, it may be sold at public auction
to the highest bidder
 under the supervision of the proper committee on
award or similar body in the presence of the auditor concerned or other
authorized representative of the Commission, 
after advertising by printed
notice in the Official Gazette, or for not less than three consecutive days in
any newspaper of general circulation
, or where the value of the
property does not warrant the expense of publication, by notices posted for a
like period in at least three public places in the locality where the property
is to be sold.  
In the event that
the public auction fails, the property may be sold at a private sale at such
price as may be fixed by the same committee or body concerned and approved by
the Commission
.â


It is only when the public auction fails that a negotiated sale is
allowed, in which case the Commission on Audit must approve the selling price.
[90]
 
The
Commission on Audit implements Section 79 of the Government Auditing Code
through Circular No. 89-296
[91]
 dated
January 27, 1989.  This circular
emphasizes that government assets must be disposed of only through public
auction, and a negotiated sale can be resorted to only in case of âfailure of
public auction.â


At the public
auction sale, only Philippine citizens are qualified to bid for PEAâs reclaimed
foreshore and submerged alienable lands of the public domain.  Private corporations are barred from bidding
at the auction sale of any kind of alienable land of the public domain.


PEA originally
scheduled a public bidding for the Freedom Islands on December 10, 1991.  PEA imposed a condition that the winning
bidder should reclaim another 250 hectares of submerged areas to regularize the
shape of the Freedom Islands, under a 60-40 sharing of the additional reclaimed
areas in favor of the winning bidder.
[92]
 
No one,
however, submitted a bid.  On December
23, 1994, the Government Corporate Counsel advised PEA it could sell the
Freedom Islands through negotiation, without need of another public bidding,
because of the failure of the public bidding on December 10, 1991.
[93]


However, the
original JVA dated April 25, 1995 covered not only the Freedom Islands and the
additional 250 hectares still to be reclaimed, it also granted an option to
AMARI to reclaim another 350 hectares.  The original JVA, a negotiated contract, enlarged the reclamation area
to 
750 hectares
.
[94]
 
The
failure of public bidding on December 10, 1991, involving only 407.84 hectares,
[95]
 
is not a
valid justification for a negotiated sale of 750 hectares, almost double the
area publicly auctioned.  Besides, the
failure of public bidding happened on December 10, 1991, more than three years
before the signing of the original JVA on April 25, 1995.  The economic situation in the country had
greatly improved during the intervening period.


Reclamation under the BOT Law and the Local
Government Code


The
constitutional prohibition in Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution
is absolute and clear: âPrivate corporations or associations may not hold such
alienable lands of the public domain except by lease, x x x.â Even Republic Act
No. 6957 (âBOT Law,â for brevity), cited by PEA and AMARI as legislative
authority to sell reclaimed lands to private parties, recognizes the
constitutional ban.  Section 6 of RA No.
6957 states â


âSec. 6.  Repayment Scheme. - For the financing, construction, operation and
maintenance of any infrastructure projects undertaken through the
build-operate-and-transfer arrangement or any of its variations pursuant to the
provisions of this Act, the project proponent x x x may likewise be repaid in
the form of a share in the revenue of the project or other non-monetary
payments, such as, but not limited to, the grant of  a portion or percentage of the reclaimed land, 
subject to
the constitutional requirements with respect to the ownership of the land
:
x x x.â (Emphasis supplied)


A private corporation, even one that undertakes the physical reclamation
of a government BOT project, cannot acquire reclaimed alienable lands of the
public domain in view of the constitutional ban.


Section 302 of
the Local Government Code, also mentioned by PEA and AMARI, authorizes local
governments in land reclamation projects to pay the contractor or developer in
kind consisting of a percentage of the reclaimed land, to wit:


âSection 302. Financing, Construction, Maintenance,
Operation, and Management of Infrastructure Projects by the Private Sector. x x
x 


x x x


In case of
land reclamation or construction of industrial estates, the repayment plan may
consist of the grant of a portion or percentage of the reclaimed land or the
industrial estate constructed.â


Although Section 302 of the Local Government Code does not contain a
proviso similar to that of the BOT Law, the constitutional restrictions on land
ownership automatically apply even though not expressly mentioned in the Local
Government Code.


Thus, under
either the BOT Law or the Local Government Code, the contractor or developer,
if a corporate entity, can only be paid with leaseholds on portions of the
reclaimed land.  If the contractor or
developer is an individual, portions of the reclaimed land, not exceeding 12
hectares
[96]
 
of non-agricultural lands, may be
conveyed to him in ownership in view of the legislative authority allowing such
conveyance.  This is the only way these
provisions of the BOT Law and the Local Government Code can avoid a direct
collision with Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution.


Registration of lands of the public domain


Finally, PEA
theorizes that the âact of conveying the ownership of the reclaimed lands to
public respondent PEA transformed such lands of the public domain to private
lands.â This theory is echoed by AMARI which maintains that the âissuance of
the special patent leading to the eventual issuance of title takes the subject
land away from the land of public domain and converts the property into patrimonial
or private property.â  In short, PEA and
AMARI contend that with the issuance of Special Patent No. 3517 and the
corresponding certificates of titles, the 157.84 hectares comprising the
Freedom Islands have become private lands of PEA.  In support of their theory, PEA and AMARI cite the following
rulings of the Court:


1. Sumail v. Judge of CFI of
Cotabato
,
[97]
 where the
Court held  â


âOnce the
patent was granted and the corresponding certificate of title was issued, the
land ceased to be part of the public domain and became private property over
which the Director of Lands has neither control nor jurisdiction.â


2. 
Lee Hong Hok v. David
,
[98]
 
where the Court declared -


âAfter the
registration and issuance of the certificate and duplicate certificate of title
based on a public land patent, the land covered thereby automatically comes
under the operation of Republic Act 496 subject to all the safeguards provided
therein.â


3. 
Heirs of Gregorio Tengco v.
Heirs of Jose Aliwalas
,
[99]
 
where the Court ruled -


âWhile the
Director of Lands has the power to review homestead patents, he may do so only
so long as the land remains part of the public domain and continues to be under
his exclusive control; but once the patent is registered and a certificate of
title is issued, the land ceases to be part of the public domain and becomes
private property over which the Director of Lands has neither control nor
jurisdiction.â


4. 
Manalo v. Intermediate
Appellate Court
,
[100]
 
where the Court held â


âWhen the
lots in dispute were certified as disposable on May 19, 1971, and free patents
were issued covering the same in favor of the private respondents, the said
lots ceased to be part of the public domain and, therefore, the Director of
Lands lost jurisdiction over the same.â


5.
Republic v. Court of Appeals
,
[101]
 
where the Court stated â


âProclamation
No. 350, dated October 9, 1956, of President Magsaysay legally effected a land
grant to the Mindanao Medical Center, Bureau of Medical Services, Department of
Health, of the whole lot, validly sufficient for initial registration under the
Land Registration Act.  Such land grant
is constitutive of a âfee simpleâ title or absolute title in favor of
petitioner Mindanao Medical Center.  Thus, Section 122 of the Act, which governs the registration of grants
or patents involving public lands, provides that âWhenever public lands in the
Philippine Islands belonging to the Government of the United States or to the
Government of the Philippines are alienated, granted or conveyed to persons or
to public or private corporations, the same shall be brought forthwith under
the operation of this Act (Land Registration Act, Act 496) and shall become
registered lands.ââ


The first four
cases cited involve petitions to cancel the land patents and the corresponding
certificates of titles 
issued to private parties
. These four
cases uniformly hold that the Director of Lands has no jurisdiction over
private lands or that upon issuance of the certificate of title the land
automatically comes under the Torrens System.  The fifth case cited involves the registration under the Torrens System
of a 12.8-hectare public land granted by the National Government to Mindanao
Medical Center, a government unit under the Department of Health.  The National Government transferred the
12.8-hectare public land to serve as the site for the hospital buildings and
other facilities of Mindanao Medical Center, which performed a public
service.  The Court affirmed the
registration of the 12.8-hectare public land in the name of Mindanao Medical
Center under Section 122 of Act No. 496.  This fifth case is an example of a public land being registered under
Act No. 496 without the land losing its character as a property of public
dominion.


In the instant
case, the only patent and certificates of title issued are those in the name of
PEA, a wholly government owned corporation performing public as well as
proprietary functions.  No patent or
certificate of title has been issued to any private party. No one is asking the
Director of Lands to cancel PEAâs patent or certificates of title.  In fact, the thrust of the instant petition
is that PEAâs certificates of title should remain with PEA, and the land
covered by these certificates, being alienable lands of the public domain,
should not be sold to a private corporation.


Registration of
land under Act No. 496 or PD No. 1529 does not vest in the registrant private
or public ownership of the land.  Registration is not a mode of acquiring ownership but is merely evidence
of ownership previously conferred by any of the recognized modes of acquiring
ownership.  Registration does not give
the registrant a better right than what the registrant had prior to the
registration.
[102]
 
The
registration of lands of the public domain under the Torrens system, by itself,
cannot convert public lands into private lands.
[103]


Jurisprudence
holding that upon the grant of the patent or issuance of the certificate of
title the alienable land of the public domain automatically becomes private
land cannot apply to government units and entities like PEA.  The transfer of the Freedom Islands to PEA
was made subject to the provisions of CA No. 141 as expressly stated in Special
Patent No. 3517 issued by then President Aquino, to wit:


âNOW,
THEREFORE, KNOW YE, that by authority of the Constitution of the Philippines
and in conformity with the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1084, 
supplemented
by Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended
, there are hereby granted and
conveyed unto the Public Estates Authority the aforesaid tracts of land
containing a total area of one million nine hundred fifteen thousand eight
hundred ninety four (1,915,894) square meters; the technical description of
which are hereto attached and made an integral part hereof.â  (Emphasis supplied)


Thus, the
provisions of CA No. 141 apply to the Freedom Islands on matters not covered by
PD No. 1084.  Section 60 of CA No. 141
prohibits, âexcept when authorized by Congress,â the sale of alienable lands of
the public domain that are transferred to government units or entities.  Section 60 of CA No. 141 constitutes, under
Section 44 of PD No. 1529, a âstatutory lien affecting titleâ of the registered
land even if not annotated on the certificate of title.
[104]
 
Alienable
lands of the public domain held by government entities under Section 60 of CA
No. 141 remain public lands because they cannot be alienated or encumbered
unless Congress passes a law authorizing their disposition.  Congress, however, cannot authorize the
sale to private corporations of reclaimed alienable lands of the public domain
because of the constitutional ban.  Only
individuals can benefit from such law.


The grant of
legislative authority to sell public lands in accordance with Section 60 of CA
No. 141 does not automatically convert alienable lands of the public domain
into private or patrimonial lands.  The
alienable lands of the public domain must be transferred to qualified private
parties, or to government entities not tasked to dispose of public lands,
before these lands can become private or patrimonial lands.  Otherwise, the constitutional ban will
become illusory if Congress can declare lands of the public domain as private
or patrimonial lands in the hands of a government agency tasked to dispose of
public lands. This will allow private corporations to acquire directly from
government agencies limitless areas of lands which, prior to such law, are
concededly public lands.


Under EO No.
525, PEA became the 
central implementing agency 
of the National
Government to reclaim foreshore and submerged areas of the public domain.  Thus, EO No. 525 declares that â 


âEXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 525


Designating the Public Estates Authority as the Agency Primarily
Responsible for all Reclamation Projects


Whereas,
there are several reclamation projects which are ongoing or being proposed to
be undertaken in various parts of the country which need to be evaluated for
consistency with national programs;


Whereas,
there is a need to give further institutional support to the Governmentâs
declared policy to provide for a coordinated, economical and efficient
reclamation of lands;


Whereas,
Presidential Decree No. 3-A requires that all reclamation of areas shall be
limited to the National Government or any person authorized by it under proper
contract;


Whereas,
a central authority is needed to act on behalf of the National Government which
shall ensure a coordinated and integrated approach in the reclamation of lands
;


Whereas,
Presidential Decree No. 1084 creates the Public Estates Authority as a
government corporation to undertake reclamation of lands and ensure their
maximum utilization in promoting public welfare and interests
; and 


Whereas,
Presidential Decree No. 1416 provides the President with continuing authority
to reorganize the national government including the transfer, abolition, or
merger of functions and offices.


NOW,
THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines, by virtue of
the powers vested in me by the Constitution and pursuant to Presidential Decree
No. 1416, do hereby order and direct the following:


Section 1.

The Public Estates Authority (PEA) shall be primarily responsible for
integrating, directing, and coordinating all reclamation projects for and on
behalf of the National Government. 
  All reclamation projects shall be approved by the President upon recommendation
of the PEA, and shall be undertaken by the PEA or through a proper contract
executed by it with any person or entity; Provided, that, reclamation projects
of any national government agency or entity authorized under its charter shall
be undertaken in consultation with the PEA upon approval of the President.


x x x .â


As the central
implementing agency tasked to undertake reclamation projects nationwide, with
authority to sell reclaimed lands, PEA took the place of DENR as the government
agency charged with leasing or selling reclaimed lands of the public
domain.  The reclaimed lands being
leased or sold by PEA are not private lands, in the same manner that DENR, when
it disposes of other alienable lands, does not dispose of private lands but alienable
lands of the public domain.  Only when
qualified private parties acquire these lands will the lands become private
lands.  
In the hands of the
government agency tasked and authorized to dispose of alienable of disposable
lands of the public domain, these lands are still public, not private lands
.  


Furthermore,
PEAâs charter expressly states that PEA â
shall hold lands of the public
domain
â as well as âany and all kinds of lands.â PEA can hold both
lands of the public domain and private lands.  Thus, the mere fact that alienable lands of the public domain like the
Freedom Islands are transferred to PEA and issued land patents or certificates
of title in PEAâs name does not automatically make such lands private.


To allow vast
areas of reclaimed lands of the public domain to be transferred to PEA as
private lands will sanction a gross violation of the constitutional ban on
private corporations from acquiring any kind of alienable land of the public
domain.  PEA will simply turn around, 
as
PEA has now done under the Amended JVA
, and transfer several hundreds
of hectares of these reclaimed and still to be reclaimed lands to a single
private corporation in only one transaction.  This scheme will effectively nullify the constitutional ban in Section
3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution which was intended to diffuse equitably
the ownership of alienable lands of the public domain among Filipinos, now
numbering over 80 million strong.


This scheme, if
allowed, can even be applied to alienable agricultural lands of the public
domain since PEA can âacquire x x x any and all kinds of lands.â  This will open the floodgates to
corporations and even individuals acquiring hundreds of hectares of alienable
lands of the public domain under the guise that in the hands of PEA these lands
are private lands.  This will result in
corporations amassing huge landholdings never before seen in this country -
creating the very evil that the constitutional ban was designed to prevent.  This will completely reverse the clear
direction of constitutional development in this country.  The 1935 Constitution allowed private
corporations to acquire not more than 1,024 hectares of public lands.
[105]
 
The 1973
Constitution prohibited private corporations from acquiring any kind of public
land, and the 1987 Constitution has unequivocally reiterated this prohibition.


The contention
of PEA and AMARI that public lands, once registered under Act No. 496 or PD No.
1529, automatically become private lands is contrary to existing laws.  Several laws authorize lands of the public
domain to be registered under the Torrens System or Act No. 496, now PD No.
1529, without losing their character as public lands.  Section 122 of Act No. 496, and Section 103 of PD No. 1529,
respectively, provide as follows:


Act No.
496


âSec. 122. Whenever public lands in
the Philippine Islands belonging to the x x x Government of the Philippine
Islands are alienated, granted, or conveyed to persons or the 
public or
private corporations
, the same shall be brought forthwith under the
operation of this Act and shall become registered lands.â


PD No.
1529


âSec. 103.  Certificate of Title to Patents.  Whenever public land is by the Government
alienated, granted or conveyed to 
any person
, the same shall be
brought forthwith under the operation of this Decree.â (Emphasis supplied)


Based on its legislative history, the phrase âconveyed to any personâ in
Section 103 of PD No. 1529 includes conveyances of public lands to public
corporations.


Alienable lands
of the public domain âgranted, donated, or transferred to a province,
municipality, or branch or subdivision of the Government,â as provided in
Section 60 of CA No. 141, may be registered under the Torrens System pursuant
to Section 103 of PD No. 1529.  Such
registration, however, is expressly subject to the condition in Section 60 of
CA No. 141 that the land âshall not be alienated, encumbered or otherwise
disposed of 
in a manner affecting its title
, 
except when
authorized by Congress
.â  This
provision refers to government reclaimed, foreshore and marshy lands of the
public domain that have been 
titled
 but still cannot be alienated
or encumbered unless expressly authorized by Congress. The need for legislative
authority prevents the registered land of the public domain from becoming
private land that can be disposed of to qualified private parties.


The Revised
Administrative Code of 1987 also recognizes that lands of the public domain may
be registered under the Torrens System.  Section 48, Chapter 12, Book I of the Code states â


âSec. 48. Official Authorized to Convey Real
Property.  Whenever real property of the
Government is authorized by law to be conveyed, the deed of conveyance shall be
executed in behalf of the government by the following:  


(1) x x x


(2) 
For property belonging to the Republic of the Philippines, but
titled in the name of any political subdivision or of any corporate agency or
instrumentality
, by the executive head of the agency or
instrumentality.â  (Emphasis supplied)


Thus, private property purchased by the National Government for
expansion of a public wharf may be titled in the name of a government
corporation regulating port operations in the country.  Private property purchased by the National
Government for expansion of an airport may also be titled in the name of the
government agency tasked to administer the airport.  Private property donated to a municipality for use as a town
plaza or public school site may likewise be titled in the name of the municipality.
[106]
 
All these
properties become properties of the public domain, and if already registered
under Act No. 496 or PD No. 1529, remain registered land. There is no
requirement or provision in any existing law for the de-registration of land
from the Torrens System.  


Private lands
taken by the Government for public use under its power of eminent domain become
unquestionably part of the public domain.  Nevertheless, Section 85 of PD No. 1529 authorizes the Register of Deeds
to issue in the name of the National Government new certificates of title covering
such expropriated lands.  Section 85 of
PD No. 1529 states â


âSec. 85.  Land taken by eminent domain.  Whenever any registered land, or interest therein, is expropriated or
taken by eminent domain, the National Government, province, city or municipality,
or any other agency or instrumentality exercising such right shall file for
registration in the proper Registry a certified copy of the judgment which
shall state definitely by an adequate description, the particular property or
interest expropriated, the number of the certificate of title, and the nature
of the public use.  A memorandum of the
right or interest taken shall be made on each certificate of title by the
Register of Deeds, and where the fee simple is taken, 
a new certificate
shall be issued in favor of the National Government, province, city,
municipality
, or any other agency or instrumentality exercising such
right for the land so taken. The legal expenses incident to the memorandum of
registration or issuance of a new certificate of title shall be for the account
of the authority taking the land or interest therein.â  (Emphasis supplied)


Consequently, lands registered under Act No. 496 or PD No. 1529 are not
exclusively private or patrimonial lands.  Lands of the public domain may also be registered pursuant to existing
laws.


AMARI makes a
parting shot that the Amended JVA is not a sale to AMARI of the Freedom Islands
or of the lands to be reclaimed from submerged areas of Manila Bay.  In the words of AMARI, the Amended JVA âis
not a sale but a joint venture with a stipulation for reimbursement of the
original cost incurred by PEA for the earlier reclamation and construction
works performed by the CDCP under its 1973 contract with the Republic.â  Whether the Amended JVA is a sale or a joint
venture, the fact remains that the Amended JVA requires PEA to âcause the
issuance and delivery of the certificates of title conveying AMARIâs Land Share
in the name of AMARI.â
[107]


This stipulation
still contravenes Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution which
provides that private corporations âshall not 
hold 
such alienable
lands of the public domain except by lease.â  The transfer of title and ownership to AMARI clearly means that AMARI
will âholdâ the reclaimed lands other than by lease.  The transfer of title and ownership is a âdispositionâ of the
reclaimed lands, a transaction considered a sale or alienation under CA No.
141,
[108]
 
the
Government Auditing Code,
[109]
 
and
Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution.


The Regalian
doctrine is deeply implanted in our legal system. Foreshore and submerged areas
form part of the public domain and are inalienable.  Lands reclaimed from foreshore and submerged areas also form part
of the public domain and are also inalienable, unless converted pursuant to law
into alienable or disposable lands of the public domain.  Historically, lands reclaimed by the
government are 
sui generis
, not available for sale to private
parties unlike other alienable public lands.   Reclaimed lands retain their inherent potential as areas for
public use or public service.  Alienable
lands of the public domain, increasingly becoming scarce natural resources, are
to be distributed equitably among our ever-growing population.  To insure such equitable distribution, the
1973 and 1987 Constitutions have barred private corporations from acquiring any
kind of alienable land of the public domain.  Those who attempt to dispose of inalienable natural resources of the
State, or seek to circumvent the constitutional ban on alienation of lands of
the public domain to private corporations, do so at their own risk.


We can now
summarize our conclusions as follows:


1.
  
The
157.84 hectares of reclaimed lands comprising the Freedom Islands, now covered
by certificates of title in the name of PEA, are 
alienable lands of the
public domain
.  PEA may lease
these lands to private corporations but may not sell or transfer ownership of
these lands to private corporations.  PEA may only sell these lands to Philippine citizens, subject to the
ownership limitations in the 1987 Constitution and existing laws.


2.
  
The
592.15 hectares of submerged areas of Manila Bay remain inalienable natural
resources of the public domain until classified as alienable or disposable lands
open to disposition and declared no longer needed for public service. The
government can make such classification and declaration only after PEA has
reclaimed these submerged areas.  Only
then can these lands qualify as agricultural lands of the public domain, which
are the only natural resources the government can alienate.  In their present state, the 592.15 hectares
of submerged areas are 
inalienable and outside the commerce of man
.


3.
  
Since
the Amended JVA seeks to transfer to AMARI, a private corporation, ownership of
77.34 hectares
[110]
 
of the Freedom Islands, such transfer is void for being
contrary to Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution which prohibits
private corporations from acquiring any kind of alienable land of the public
domain.


4.
  
Since
the Amended JVA also seeks to transfer to AMARI ownership of 290.156 hectares
[111]
 
of still submerged areas of Manila Bay, such transfer is
void for being contrary to Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution
which prohibits the alienation of natural resources other than agricultural
lands of the public domain.  PEA may
reclaim these submerged areas. Thereafter, the government can classify the
reclaimed lands as alienable or disposable, and further declare them no longer
needed for public service.  Still, the
transfer of such reclaimed alienable lands of the public domain to AMARI will
be void in view of Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution which
prohibits private corporations from acquiring any kind of alienable land of the
public domain.


Clearly, the Amended JVA violates glaringly Sections 2 and 3, Article
XII of the 1987 Constitution.  Under
Article 1409
[112]
 
of the Civil Code, contracts whose
âobject or purpose is contrary to law,â or whose âobject is outside the
commerce of men,â are âinexistent and void from the beginning.â  The Court must perform its duty to defend
and uphold the Constitution, and therefore declares the Amended JVA
 null
and void ab initio.


Seventh
issue: whether the Court is the proper forum to raise the issue of whether the
Amended JVA is grossly disadvantageous to the government.


Considering that
the Amended JVA is null and void 
ab initio
, there is no necessity to
rule on this last issue.  Besides, the
Court is not a trier of facts, and this last issue involves a determination of
factual matters.


WHEREFORE
, the petition is GRANTED.  The Public Estates Authority and Amari
Coastal Bay Development Corporation are PERMANENTLY ENJOINED from implementing
the Amended Joint Venture Agreement which is hereby declared NULL and VOID 
ab
initio
.


SO ORDERED.

Section 270 of the National Internal Revenue Code
punishes any officer or employee of the Bureau of Internal Revenue who divulges
to any person, except as allowed by law, information regarding the business,
income, or estate of any taxpayer, the secrets, operation, style of work, or
apparatus of any manufacturer or producer, or confidential information
regarding the business of any taxpayer, knowledge of which was acquired by him
in the discharge of his official duties.  Section 14 of R.A. No. 8800 (Safeguard Measures Act) prohibits the
release to the public of confidential information submitted in evidence to the
Tariff Commission.  Section 3 (n) of
R.A. No. 8504 (Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act) classifies as confidential
the medical records of HIV patients.  Section 6 (j) of R.A. No. 8043 (Inter-Country Adoption Act) classifies
as confidential the records of the adopted child, adopting parents, and natural
parents.  Section 94 (f) of R.A. No.

The 
Recopilacion de Leyes de las Indias

declared that: âWe, having acquired full sovereignty over the Indies, and all
lands, territories, and possessions not heretofore ceded away by our royal
predecessors, or by us, or in our name, still pertaining to the royal crown and
patrimony, it is our will that all lands which are held without proper and true
deeds of grant be restored to us according as they belong to us, in order that
after reserving before all what to us or to our viceroys, audiencias, and
governors may seem necessary for public squares, ways, pastures, and commons in
those places which are peopled, taking into consideration not only their
present condition, but also their future and their probable increase, and after
distributing to the natives what may be necessary for tillage and pasturage,
confirming them in what they now have and giving them more if necessary, all
the rest of said lands may remain free and unencumbered for us to dispose of as
we may wish.â

CariÃ±o 
v

(1909).  The exception mentioned in 
CariÃ±o,

referring to lands in the possession of an occupant and of his
predecessors-in-interest, since time immemorial, is actually a species of a
grant by the State. The United States Supreme Court, speaking through Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.,  declared in

CariÃ±o
: âPrescription is mentioned again in the royal cedula of October
15, 1754, cited in 3 Philippine, 546; âWhere such possessors shall not be able
to produce title deeds, it shall be sufficient if they shall show that ancient
possession, as a valid title by prescription.â  It may be that this means possession from before 1700; but, at all
events, the principle is admitted.  As
prescription, even against the Crown lands, was recognized by the laws of
Spain, we see no sufficient reason for hesitating to admit that it was
recognized in the Philippines in regard to lands over which Spain had only a
paper sovereignty.â

Act No. 926, enacted on October 7, 1903, was also
titled the Public Land Act.  This Act,
however, did not cover reclaimed lands.  Nevertheless, Section 23 of this Act provided as follows: âx x x  In no case may lands leased under the
provisions of this chapter be taken so as to gain control of adjacent land,
water, stream, shore line, way, roadstead, or other valuable right which in the
opinion of the Chief of the Bureau of Public Lands would be prejudicial to the

Section 10 of Act No. 2874 provided as follows: âThe
words âalienation,â âdisposition,â or âconcessionâ as used in this Act, shall
mean any of the methods authorized by this Act for the acquisition, lease, use,
or benefit of the lands of the public domain other than timber or mineral
lands.â






[48]
 
Title II of Act No. 2874 governed alienable lands of
the public domain for agricultural purposes, while Title III of the same Act
governed alienable lands of the public domain for non-agricultural purposes.






[49]
 
Section 57 of Act No. 2874  provided as follows: âx x x; but the land so granted, donated, or

Act provided shall be understood or construed to change or modify the
administration and disposition of the lands commonly called âfriar landsâ and
those which, being privately owned, have reverted to or become the property of
the Commonwealth of the Philippines, which administration and disposition shall
be governed by the laws at present in force or which may hereafter be enacted.â






[52]
 
Like Act No. 2874, Section 10 of CA No. 141 defined
the terms âalienationâ and âdispositionâ as follows: âThe words âalienation,â
âdisposition,â or âconcessionâ as used in this Act, shall mean any of the

R.A. No. 6657 has suspended the authority of the
President to reclassify forest or mineral lands into agricultural lands.  Section 4 (a) of RA No. 6657
(Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988) states, âNo reclassification of
forest or mineral lands to  agricultural
lands shall be undertaken after the approval of this Act until Congress, taking
into account ecological, developmental and equity considerations, shall have
delimited by law, the specific limits of the public domain.â

Section 1, Article XIII of the 1935 Constitution
limited the disposition and utilization of public agricultural lands to
Philippine citizens or to corporations at least sixty percent owned by
Philippine citizens. This was, however, subject to the original Ordinance
appended to the 1935 Constitution stating, among others, that until the
withdrawal of United States sovereignty in the Philippines, âCitizens and
corporations of the United States shall enjoy in the Commonwealth of the
Philippines all the civil rights of the citizens and corporations, respectively,
thereof.â






[57]
 
Section 44 of PD No. 1529 (previously Section 39 of
Act No. 496) provides that âliens, claims or rights arising or existing under
the laws and the Constitution of the Philippines which are not by law required
to appear of record in the Registry of Deeds in order to be valid against
subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers of recordâ constitute statutory liens
affecting the title.






[58]
 
RA No. 730, which took effect on June 18, 1952,
authorized the 
private sale
 of home lots to actual occupants of
public lands not needed for public service.  Section 1 of RA No. 730 provided as follows: âNotwithstanding the
provisions of Sections 61 and 67 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended by RA
No. 293, any Filipino citizen of legal age who is not the owner of a home lot
in the municipality or city in which he resides and who had in good faith
established his residence on a parcel of land of the Republic of the
Philippines which is not needed for public service, shall be given preference
to purchase at a private sale of which reasonable notice shall be given to him,
not more than one thousand square meters at a price to be fixed by the Director
of Lands with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources.  x x x.â  In addition, on June 16, 1948, Congress
enacted R.A. No. 293 allowing the 
private sale
 of marshy
alienable or disposable lands of the public domain to lessees who have improved
and utilized the same as farms, fishponds or other similar purposes for at
least five years from the date of the lease contract with the government.  R.A. No. 293, however, did not apply to
marshy lands under Section 56 (c), Title III of CA No. 141 which refers to
marshy lands leased for residential, commercial, industrial or other 
non-agricultural
purposes

divestment
or disposal of assets of government-owned and/or controlled corporations

and their subsidiaries.â  Likewise, COA
Audit Circular No. 89-296 dated January 27, speaks of âguidelines (which) shall
be observed and adhered to in the 
divestment or  disposal of property and other assets of all government
entities/instrumentalities
â and that âdivestment shall refer to the
manner or scheme of taking away, depriving, withdrawing of an authority, power
or title.â  These COA Circulars
