[ G.R. No. 143574, July 11, 2002 ]


MANILA HOTEL CORPORATION, PETITIONER,
VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND SAMUEL ALCORDO, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


This is a
petition for review on 
certiorari
 seeking to set aside the Resolutions
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals
[2]
 in CA-G.R. SP No. 57760, which
dismissed petitionerâs special civil action for certiorari assailing the
October 29, 1999 decision of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC
NCR CN. 00-12-09877-98.
[3]


Private
respondent was hired by petitioner on March 23, 1998 as Food and Beverage
Director with a salary of P75,000.00 a month.  On November 30, 1998, however, his services were terminated on the
ground of loss of confidence due to his inability to improve the profitability
of the restaurants under his responsibility.  Private respondent filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against
petitioner.


On June 14,
1999, the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision
[4]
 dismissing the complaint for
illegal dismissal on the ground that private respondent, a managerial employee,
was hired not only to oversee the operations of the restaurants but precisely
to improve their profitability.  Hence,
the failure of private respondent to meet this condition despite regular
monthly evaluation by petitioner, showing the substantial drop in the
profitability of the department under his control, justified his dismissal for
loss of confidence.  Petitioner was,
however, ordered to pay private respondentâs one month salary of P80,000.00 in
lieu of the 30-day advance notice of dismissal, plus an indemnity of P5,000.00
for its failure to comply with procedural due process.


Petitioner
appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which reversed the
decision of the Labor Arbiter on October 29, 1999.  It ruled that petitioner failed to prove that private respondent
was hired subject to the condition that he would improve the profitability of
the restaurants, and that the unsatisfactory performance of said restaurants
was due to the fault or negligence of private respondent.  The dispositive portion of the said decision
reads:


WHEREFORE, the decision appealed
from is hereby REVERSED, and respondent Manila Hotel Inc. is ordered to pay the
complainant the following: (1) full backwages, inclusive of allowances, from
December 1, 1998 up to date of finality of this decision; (2) separation pay
equivalent to one month salary for every year of service, reckoned from March
23, 1998 up to the date of finality of this decision; and (3) moral and
exemplary damages amounting to P50,000.00 and 30,000.00, respectively.


SO ORDERED.
[5]


A motion for reconsideration
of the foregoing decision was denied on January 12, 2000.
[6]


A petition for
certiorari was filed by petitioner with the Court of Appeals which dismissed
the petition on the following grounds: 1) the petition was not accompanied with
copies of the decision of the Labor Arbiter and the position paper of the
parties; 2) the certificate of non-forum shopping was signed by Atty. Martin B.
Isidro, petitionerâs counsel and Assistant Vice-President, Personnel
Department; and 3) the petition was not accompanied with a board resolution
authorizing Atty. Martin B. Isidro to act for and in behalf of petitioner.


A motion for
reconsideration was filed by petitioner alleging that the failure to attach
said documents to the petition was due to inadvertence or oversight.
[7]
 Attached to the motion were copies
of the omitted decision of the Labor Arbiter, the position papers, as well as
the required board resolution.
[8]


On June 8, 2000,
the Court of Appeals denied the motion for reconsideration stressing that under
Rule 46, Section 3, in relation to Rule 65, Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of
Civil Procedure, failure to append copies of relevant documents is sufficient
ground for the dismissal of the petition.  Hence, the instant petition for review on certiorari praying for a
liberal interpretation of the rules of procedure.


The petition is
without merit.


Pertinent
portion of Rule 65, Section 1 and Rule 46, Section 3 of the 1997 Rules of Civil
Procedure, provide:


SECTION 1.  Petition for certiorari.â

The petition shall be accompanied

copies of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto, and a
sworn certification of non-forum shopping as provided in the third paragraph of
Section 3, Rule 46.

with the original copy intended for the court indicated as such by the
petitioner, and shall be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original or
certified true copy of the judgment, order, resolution or ruling subject
thereof, such material portions of the record as are referred to therein, and
other documents relevant or pertinent thereto. . . . .

The failure of the petitioner to
comply with any of the foregoing requirements shall be sufficient ground for
the dismissal of the petition. 
(Emphasis
supplied)


The Court of
Appeals outrightly dismissed petitionerâs action on the ground that the
petition was not accompanied with the required board resolution authorizing
Atty. Martin B. Isidro to institute the petition; as well as copies of the
Labor Arbiterâs decision and the position paper of the parties.  The issue posed before the Court of Appeals
is the validity of the termination of private respondentâs employment.  Hence, the need to append copies of the
Labor Arbiterâs decision and the position papers of the parties.  Under the circumstances, there was a
necessity for the appellate court to review the facts and the law on which the
conclusions were based, considering the conflicting findings of the NLRC and
the Labor Arbiter.


Liberal
construction of the rule has been allowed by this Court in the following cases:
(1) where a rigid application will result in manifest failure or miscarriage of
justice, especially if a party successfully shows that the alleged defect in
the questioned final and executory judgment is not apparent on its face or from
the recitals contained therein; (2) where the interest of substantial justice
will be served; (3) where the resolution of the motion is addressed solely to
the sound and judicious discretion of the court; and (4) where the injustice to
the adverse party is not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in
not complying with the procedure prescribed.
[9]


Petitioner
contends that the omission of the required documents is due to âoversightâ or
âinadvertence.â  In 
Sea Power
Shipping Enterprises, Inc.  v. Court of
Appeals, et al.
,
[10]
 however, the Court held that
âoversightâ and âexcusable negligenceâ have become an all too familiar and
ready excuse on the part of lawyers remiss in their bounden duty to comply with
established rules.  Rules of procedure
are tools designed to promote efficiency and orderliness as well as to
facilitate attainment of justice, such that strict adherence thereto is
required. The application of the Rules may be relaxed only when rigidity would
result in a defeat of equity and substantial justice.


In the case at
bar, petitioner has not shown any cogent reason for the Court to be liberal in
the application of the rules.
[11]
 Hence, the dismissal of its
petition by the Court of Appeals on technical grounds must be sustained.


WHEREFORE
, in view of all the foregoing, the
petition is DENIED.  The appealed
Resolutions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 57760 are AFFIRMED.


SO ORDERED.
