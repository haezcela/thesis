RENE KNECHT AND KNECHT,
INC., PETITIONERS, VS. UNITED CIGARETTE CORP., REPRESENTED BY ENCARNACION
GONZALES WONG, AND EDUARDO BOLIMA, SHERIFF, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 151,
PASIG CITY, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


Before us is a
petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 seeking to set aside the Decision
dated May 19, 1999 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 47978 upholding
the validity of the Orders dated June 27, 1997 and May 12, 1998 issued by the
Regional Trial Court, Branch 151, Pasig City in Civil Case No. 9165.


The facts are:


Rose Packing
Company, Inc. (Rose Packing), a domestic corporation, owns three (3) parcels of
land with a total area of 31, 842 square meters situated in Sto. Domingo,
Cainta, Rizal.  The largest among these
parcels has an area of 31,447 square meters covered by Transfer Certificate of
Title (TCT) No. 73620 of the Registry of Deeds of Rizal.  The other two remaining parcels are
unregistered.  The area covered by TCT
No. 73620 is mortgaged with the Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank
(PCIB).


On October 26,
1965, Rose Packing, through its President Rene Knecht, sold to the United
Cigarette Corporation (UCC), a domestic corporation, the said parcels of land,
with all the buildings and improvements thereon, for 
P
800,000.00.
[2]
 Rose Packing made a warranty that
the lots are free from all liens and encumbrances, except the real estate
mortgage constituted over the area covered by TCT No. 73620.  For its part, UCC promised to pay the
purchase price under the following terms and conditions: (a) a 
P
250,000.00
down payment must be made upon signing of the deed of sale with mortgage;  (b) it will assume Rose Packingâs 
P
250,000.00
overdraft line obligation with the PCIB, subject to the latterâs approval; and
(c) the balance of 
P
300,000.00 shall be paid in two annual installments at

P
150,000.00 each (within 12 and 14 months) from the date of sale, with
10% annual interest.  To secure the
deal, UCC initially paid Rose Packing 
P
80,000.00 as earnest money.


Before the deed
of sale could be executed, the parties found that Rose Packingâs actual
obligation with the PCIB far exceeded the 
P
250,000.00 which UCC assumed
to pay under their agreement.  So the
PCIB demanded additional collateral from UCC as a condition precedent for the
approval of the sale of the mortgaged property.  However, UCC did not comply.


Meanwhile, Rose
Packing again offered to sell the same lots to other prospective buyers without
the knowledge of UCC and without returning to the latter the earnest money it
earlier paid.
[3]


Aggrieved, UCC,
on March 2, 1966, filed with the then Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal,
Branch I, a complaint against Rose Packing and Rene Knecht for specific
performance and recovery of damages, docketed as Civil Case No. 9165.


On July 15,
1969, the CFI rendered a Decision holding that Rose Packing was in bad faith
when it did not inform UCC the amount of its actual obligation with the
PCIB.  Considering that UCC agreed to
assume the overdraft line obligation of Rose Packing with the PCIB only to the
extent of 
P
250,000.00, it (UCC) cannot be compelled to assume the excess
obligation.  The dispositive portion of
the CFI Decision reads:


âPREMISES CONSIDERED, this Court
orders defendants Rose Packing Companyâs, Inc. and its President, Rene Knecht
to convey and deliver to plaintiff, United Cigarette Corporation, the three
parcels of land object of the complaint, together with all the buildings and
improvements thereon, with the exception of machines for canning factory, and
to execute the corresponding deed of sale with mortgage covering said properties
for the purchase price of 
P
800,000.00 under the following terms and
conditions: 
P
250,000.00 as down payment upon the signing of the Deed of
Sale with Mortgage, less the 
P
80,000.00 which plaintiff had paid to
defendant company as earnest money and less the amount in excess of the 
P
250,000.00
overdraft line obligation of defendant corporation with Philippine Commercial
and Industrial Bank which the parties had agreed will be assumed by the
plaintiff; assumption by the plaintiff of the total of the overdraft line
obligation of defendant corporation to the Philippine Commercial and &
Industrial Bank for which the properties are answerable; and the balance of 
P
300,000.00
to be paid in two equal installments payable 12 months and 24 months from date
of sale with 10% annual interest each installment to be covered by draft
accepted by the Philippine Bank of Commerce; provided, that, together with the 
P
80,000.00
earnest money paid by plaintiff to defendant, should the sum of defendant
corporationâs overdraft line obligation to the Philippine Commercial and
Industrial Bank (which obligation will be assumed by plaintiff) total more than

P
420,000.00, which is the total of the 
P
170,000.00 still due as
down payment and the 
P
250,000.00 agreed portion of the obligation to the
Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank to be assumed by plaintiff, the
excess over said amount of 
P
420,000.00, as well as the other amounts
which plaintiff may have to pay for existing attachments and other encumbrances
authorized by existing orders and the expenses in connection with the same,
shall be insufficient from the 2
nd
 installment as well.


âShould the total balance of 
P
720,000.00
of the purchase price be insufficient to free the properties from the
obligation of defendant corporation for which they are or have been made
answerable, defendant corporation is hereby ordered to reimburse plaintiff the
amount of the excess and to execute the appropriate and effective deed without
mortgage transferring and conveying the subject properties to plaintiff.


âDefendant Rose Packing Company,
Inc., is also ordered to pay plaintiff the amount of 
P
10,000.00 in moral
damages and to indemnify plaintiff United Cigarette Corporation in the amount
of 
P
20,000.00 as litigation expenses which include the costs of this
suit and attorneyâs fees.


âSO ORDERED.â
[4]


Rose Packing
interposed an appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA), docketed as CA-G.R. No.
45525-R.  On March 30, 1973 and during
the pendency of this appeal, UCCâs corporate life expired.
[5]
 Alberto Wong, one of UCCâs major
stockholders, was appointed trustee/liquidator of the dissolved
corporation.  He then represented UCC in
the proceedings in Civil Case 9165.
[6]


On June 26,
1976, the CA affirmed the CFI Decision with modification in the sense that  the award of moral damages was deleted.  This prompted Rose Packing and Rene Knecht
to file with this Court a petition for review on certiorari, docketed as G.R.
No. L-44977.  In a Resolution dated
January 5, 1977, this Court denied the petition for lack of merit.
[7]
 They filed a motion for
reconsideration but was denied.  On
March 23, 1977, this Courtâs Decision became final and executory.
[8]


Unfortunately,
several supervening incidents hampered the due execution of the CFI Decision.


The records show
that on July 15, 1968, even before the trial court could render its Decision in
Civil Case No 9165, Rose Packing filed Civil Case No. 11015 with Branch 2 of
the same CFI, praying among others, to enjoin the PCIB from proceeding with the
foreclosure sale of the land covered by TCT No. 73620.  The CFI denied the application for
injunction.  Thus, the foreclosure sale
proceeded and title over the subject lot was consolidated in the name of the
PCIB through the issuance of TCT No. 286176 by the Registry of Deeds of Rizal.
[9]
 On appeal by Rose Packing, docketed
as CA-G.R. No. 43198-R, the Court of Appeals upheld the validity of the
foreclosure sale but declared void 
ab initio
 the consolidation of
ownership in the name of PCIB over the subject property for being
premature.  The appellate court granted
Rose Packing a 60-day period within which to redeem the foreclosed
property.  Unsatisfied, Rose Packing
filed a petition for review on certiorari with this Court, docketed as G.R. No.
L.-33084.
[10]


On November 14,
1988, this Court rendered a Decision in G.R. No. L.-33084
[11]
 declaring the foreclosure sale void
and remanding Civil Case No. 11015 to the lower court for further proceedings
to determine the exact amount of Rose Packingâs liability with the PCIB.  In effect, ownership over the subject
property reverted to Rose Packing.  At
that time, however, Rose Packing (like UCC) had been dissolved with the
expiration of its corporate charter on June 10, 1986.  Thereupon, Knecht, Inc., a domestic corporation, undertook the
liquidation of Rose Packingâs assets as well as the winding-up of its pending
affairs.


Subsequently, on
July 19, 1990, UCC, through its liquidator Alberto Wong, filed with the CFI,
Branch 2 a motion for leave to intervene and to admit its complaint-in-intervention
in Civil Case No. 11015, which case was then absorbed by Branch 152 of the
Regional Trial Court (RTC), Pasig City pursuant to the implementation of Batas
Pambansa Blg. 129 (the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1981).
[12]
 The complaint-in-intervention sought
to compel Rose Packing to comply with the Decision in Civil Case No. 9165 and
prayed that a writ of execution be issued to enforce that decision.  Rose Packing, through its
liquidator/trustee, Knecht, Inc., opposed the motion claiming that the Decision
in Civil Case No. 9165 which became final on March 23, 1977 can no longer be
enforced since more than ten (10) years had elapsed from its finality.
[13]


Despite the
opposition, the RTC of Pasig (Branch 152), in an Order dated December 10, 1990,
granted UCCâs motion for leave to intervene and admitted its
complaint-in-intervention.  On October
10, 1991, the same court issued an Order granting the writ of execution prayed
for by UCC to enforce the Decision in Civil Case No. 9165.


Rose Packing,
through Knecht, Inc. then questioned the validity of these twin orders via a
petition for certiorari with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 26545.  The CA, in its Decision dated March 5, 1992,
[14]
 nullified the CFI Orders dated
December 10, 1990 and October 10, 1991, holding that UCCâs intervention in
Civil Case No. 11015 is not warranted since the âonly purpose is to execute the
judgment obtained by UCC against petitioner (Rose Packing) in Civil Case No.
9165.â Thus, the RTC of Pasig City (Branch 152) has no jurisdiction to admit
the complaint-in-intervention and to issue the assailed writ of execution.


While it
nullified the Orders dated December 10, 1990 and October 10, 1991, the CA
nonetheless stressed that 
âUCCâs right to execute the judgment in Civil Case
No. 9165 has not yet prescribed insofar as the parcel of land covered by TCT
No. 73620 is concernedâ 
because this land was involved in Civil Case No.
11015.  Its execution can be availed of
in Branch 151, not in Branch 152, of the RTC, Pasig City.  As regards the 
two other unregistered
parcels of land,
 the judgment 
has already prescribed because these
properties were not involved in Civil Case No. 11015, hence, UCC should have
then sought the execution of the judgment with respect to said properties.


Pursuant to the
CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 26545, the RTC of Pasig City (Branch 151) issued
an Order on June 17, 1992
[15]
 granting UCCâs motion for the
issuance of a writ of execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. 9165 with
respect to the land covered by TCT 73620 (then still in the name of PCIB under
TCT No. 286176).


In seeking the
annulment of this order, Rose Packing, through Knecht, Inc. and Rene Knecht,
filed with the CA CA-G.R. SP No. 28333 for certiorari.  For the second time, it assailed the
validity of the judgment in Civil Case No. 9165 and reiterated its position
that UCCâs right to enforce that judgment had already prescribed.


On March 18,
1993, the CA rendered a Decision
[16]
 in CA-G.R. SP No. 28333 reiterating
its ruling in CA-G.R. No. 26545 that UCCâs right to file a motion  for execution of the Decision in Civil Case
No. 9165 has not yet prescribed insofar as the titled land is concerned, and
that Rose Packing could no longer re-litigate Civil Case No. 9165 which had
long become final and executory.


Forthwith, Rose
Packing filed a petition for review on 
certiorari
 with this Court,
docketed as G.R. No. 109385.  On August
30, 1993, this Court denied the petition
[17]
 on the ground that 
no reversible error was
committed by the CA

in rendering the questioned decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 28333.  Rose Packing filed a motion for
reconsideration but it was denied 
with finality
 by this Court in a Resolution dated October 20, 1993.


On November 14,
1993, Knecht, Inc. and Rene Knecht, claiming that they had just discovered UCCâs
dissolution on April 10, 1973 and that the three-year period to liquidate its
affairs had already expired, again questioned before the RTC of Pasig City,
Branch 151, the validity of the June 17, 1992 Order granting the writ of
execution in Civil Case No. 9165.  They
averred that upon its dissolution, UCC may no longer move for execution.


On March 24,
1994, the trial court ordered the issuance of an alias writ of execution in
favor of UCC.
[18]
 The alias writ was subsequently
issued on April 19, 1994.


When the alias
writ was about to be implemented, Rose Packing, through Knecht, Inc. and Rene
Knecht, instituted another petition with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No.
33852.
[19]
 They assailed the validity of the
writ, reiterating that the judgment in Civil Case No. 9165 which had become
final and executory in 1977 cannot be enforced in favor of UCC due to the
latterâs dissolution in 1973.


The CA, on
October 25, 1994, dismissed the petition.
[20]
 It ruled that the validity and
propriety of the enforcement of the Decision in Civil Case No. 9165 had been
resolved with finality in CA-G.R. SP No. 26545 and CA-G.R. SP No 28333, and
affirmed by this Court in G.R. No. 109385.


Aggrieved,
Knecht, Inc. and Rene Knecht again filed a petition with this Court, docketed
as G.R. Nos. 118183-84, questioning the Decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. SP No. 33852.  In a Resolution
dated January 30, 1995, this Court denied the petition for being technically
infirm.  Their motion for
reconsideration was denied 
with finality
 on March 15, 1995.
[21]


On July 15,
1995, UCC, thru Encarnacion Gonzales Wong, its new trustee/liquidation,  filed a motion for the issuance of a second
alias writ of execution to enforce the decision in Civil Case No. 9165 insofar
as the land covered by TCT No. 73620 is concerned.  Surprisingly, for unknown reasons, title over the subject realty
(then already substituted by TCT No. 286176 in the name of PCIB) underwent an
anomalous transfer in the name of Knecht, Inc under TCT No. 613113.
[22]


On November 8,
1995, upon UCCâs motion, the trial court issued a 
Second Alias Writ of
 
Execution.
[23]


To further
derail the implementation of the second alias writ of execution over the
property covered by TCT No. 613113, Knecht, Inc. and Rene Knecht filed a
petition with the CA, docketed as CA G.R. SP No. 39003.  They contended anew that Civil Case No. 9165
can no longer be enforced for having been rendered moot and academic because of
UCCâs dissolution in 1973 and that of Rose Packing in 1986.  Finding the contention devoid of merit, the
CA in its Decision dated May 8, 1996,
[24]
 dismissed the petition.  It held that the three-year period allowed
to a dissolved corporation for liquidating its assets and winding up of its
affairs can be extended under certain circumstances where, as here, the suit
filed by UCC during its corporate existence necessarily prolonged that
period.  Moreover, mere dissolution of a
corporation cannot be invoked by Rose Packing to unjustly enrich itself at the
expense of the dissolved corporation.


Knecht, Inc. and
Rene Knecht filed with this Court a petition for review, docketed as G.R. No.
124983, questioning the CA Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 39003.  In a Resolution dated August 26, 1996, this
Court dismissed the petition for petitionersâ failure to pay the prescribed docketing
and other fees within the reglementary period.  On November 11, 1996, their motion for reconsideration was denied with
finality.
[25]


Thereafter, the
trial court, upon motion
[26]
 by UCC, issued an Order dated June
27, 1997
[27]
 directing Sheriff Eduardo L. Bolima
of Branch 151, RTC, Pasig City to execute the corresponding deed of sale with
mortgage in compliance with the judgment in Civil Case No. 9165.


Rene Knecht
filed a motion for reconsideration
[28]
 insisting that the execution of the
judgment in Civil Case No. 9165 cannot be availed of anymore whether against
Rose Packing or in favor of UCC because both corporations had been
dissolved.  This motion was denied by
the trial court in an Order dated May 12, 1998.
[29]


Undaunted, Rene
Knecht and Knecht, Inc. filed a petition with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP
No. 47978, assailing the trial courtâs jurisdiction to issue the June 27, 1997
and May 12, 1998 Orders.  They impleaded
as respondents Hon. Deogracias O. Felizardo (Judge, RTC, Branch 151, Pasig
City), Sheriff Eduardo L. Bolima and UCC.  Pending resolution of this petition, Sheriff Bolima executed a
âSheriffâs Deed of Absolute Saleâ
[30]
 dated June 16, 1998 transferring to
UCC the parcel of land covered by TCT No. 613113 for a consideration of 
P
720,000.00
(which is the difference between the agreed purchase price of 
P
800,000.00
and the amount of 
P
80,000.00 paid by UCC as earnest money).  UCC deposited the 
P
720,000.00 with
the Cashier of the Clerk of Court, RTC, Pasig City.


On May 10, 1999,
the CA rendered the now questioned Decision,
[31]
 upholding the twin orders of the
trial court dated June 27, 1997 and May 12, 1998.  The CA emphasized that all the issues raised in the petition â
including the validity of the enforcement of the decision and the corresponding
writ of execution issued in Civil Case No. 9165 in favor of UCC â had already
been finally decided and judicially laid to rest in the several certiorari
proceedings filed by Rene Knecht and Knecht, Inc. with the Court of Appeals and
this court.  These issues cannot be reopened
and re-litigated without violating the rule on 
res judicata
.  Furthermore, the certiorari proceedings
directed against the enforcement of the same decision and writ of execution
constitute forum-shopping which, in essence, âdegrades the administration of
justiceâ.


Upon denial by
the CA of their motion for reconsideration, Rene Knecht and Knecht, Inc. filed
the present petition for review on certiorari assailing the Decision in CA-G.R.
SP No. 47978.


In the main,
petitioners vehemently aver that the absence of a statutory authority for the
extension of the life of UCC for the purpose of pursuing Civil Case No. 9165
after its dissolution rendered void the July 15, 1969 Decision of the trial
court in that case.  A void decision can
be attacked any time either directly or collaterally without violating the
rules on 
res judicata
 and non-forum shopping.  Necessarily, the writs of execution and all other orders issued
by the trial court to implement that void decision are likewise void.  In support of this contention, petitioners
cite 
Sumera vs. Valencia
,
[32]
 
National Abaca and Other Fibers
Corporation vs. Pore
[33]
 and 
Board of Liquidators vs.
Kalaw
.
[34]


Furthermore,
petitioners claim that the November 8, 1995 second alias writ of execution
cannot be implemented by the June 27, 1997 Order of the trial court because:
(1) the second alias writ varied the terms of the judgment in Civil Case No.
9165 resulting in the deprivation of petitioner Knecht, Inc. of its property
without due process; and (2) the said writ having expired, became 
functus
officio.


The petition
lacks merit.


Viewed from the
facts stated above, it appears that petitioners have filed a total of eight (8)
appeals and/or petitions (including the present petition) with this Court and
the CA, all geared towards frustrating the execution of the judgment in Civil
Case No. 9165, to wit:


1. CA-G.R. SP No. 28333 â Petition
for certiorari filed with the CA to annul the June 17, 1992 Order of the RTC,
Branch 151, Pasig City allowing the issuance of a writ of execution to enforce
the decision in Civil Case No. 9165 (in accordance with the Decision of the CA
in CA-G.R. SP No. 26545).  Petitioners
insisted that the judgment in Civil Case No. 9165 cannot be enforced due to
prescription.  The CA dismissed the
petition and upheld the questioned order of the trial court;


2. G.R. No. 109385 â Petition for
review on certiorari filed with this Court questioning the CA Decision in
CA-G.R. SP No. 28333.  This Court found
no reversible error on the part of the CA;


3. CA-G.R. SP No. 33852 â Petition
for certiorari filed with the CA seeking to enjoin the enforcement of an alias
writ of execution issued by the trial court on April 19, 1994.  Petitioners interposed the new argument that
the judgment in Civil Case No. 9165 cannot be enforced due to the dissolution
of UCC on March 30, 1973.  The CA
dismissed the petition;


4. G.R. Nos. 118183 and 118184 â
Petition for review on certiorari filed with this Court questioning the CA
Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 33852.  This
Court dismissed the petition in a Resolution dated January 30, 1995;


5. CA-G.R. SP No. 39003 â Petition
for certiorari and prohibition with prayer for the issuance of temporary
restraining order filed with the CA seeking, among others, the annulment of the
second alias writ of execution issued by the trial court on November 8,
1995.  Petitioners reiterated that the
judgment in Civil Case No. 9165 cannot anymore be enforced for having been
rendered moot and academic by the dissolution of UCC.  The CA denied this petition for lack of merit and upheld the
validity of the second alias writ of execution;


6. G.R. No. 124983 â Petition for
review on certiorari filed with this Court questioning the CA Decision in
CA-G.R. SP No. 39003.  This Court denied
the petition in a Resolution dated August 26, 1996;


7. CA-G.R. SP No. 47978 â Petition
for certiorari filed with the CA seeking to annul the June 27, 1997 Order of
the trial court directing Sheriff Eduardo L. Bolima of Branch 151, RTC, Pasig
City to execute the corresponding deed of sale with mortgage in compliance with
the judgment and the second alias writ of execution issued in Civil Case No.
9165.  Petitioners persistently claimed
that the decision in Civil Case No. 9165 is voided by the expiration of UCCâs
three-year period of liquidation from its dissolution.  Furthermore, they theorized that the second
alias writ of execution is improper because it varied the terms of the judgment
and also deprived Knecht, Inc. of its property without due process of law.  The CA denied this petition and cited
petitioners guilty of forum shopping;


8. G.R. No. 139370 â The present
petition for review filed with this Court questioning the decision of the CA in
CA-G.R. SP No. 47978.


Petitionersâ
basis in filing these multiple petitions is the expiration of UCCâs corporate
existence.


There is no
doubt that the judgment in Civil Case No. 9165 became final and executory on
March 23, 1977. That this judgment is still enforceable was decided with
finality by this Court in G.R. No. 109385.


In 
Reburiano
vs. Court of Appeals
,
[35]
 a case with similar facts, this
Court held:


âthe
trustee (of a dissolved corporation) may  commence a suit which can proceed to final judgment 
even beyond the
three-year period (of liquidation) 
x x x
, no reason can be conceived why
a suit already commenced by the corporation itself during its existence,

not by a mere trustee who, by fiction, merely continues the legal personality
of the dissolved corporation, 
should not be accorded similar treatment â to
proceed to final judgment and execution thereof.â 
  (Emphasis ours)


Indeed, the
rights of a corporation (dissolved pending litigation) are accorded protection
by law.  This is clear from Section 145
of the Corporation Code, thus:


âSection 145. 
Amendment or
repeal
. 
No right or remedy in favor of 
or against 
any
corporation,
 its stockholders, members, directors, trustees, or officers,
nor any liability incurred by any such corporation, stockholders, members,
directors, trustees, or officers,
 shall be removed or impaired either by the
subsequent dissolution of said corporation 
or by any subsequent amendment
or repeal of this Code or of any part thereof.â (Emphasis ours)


The dissolution
of UCC itself, or the expiration of its three-year liquidation period, should
not be a bar to the enforcement of its rights as a corporation.  One of these rights, to be sure, includes
the UCCâs right to seek from the court the execution of a valid and final
judgment in Civil Case No. 9165 â through its trustee/liquidator Encarnacion
Gonzales Wong â for the benefit of its stockholders, creditors and any other
person who may have legal claims against it.  To hold otherwise would be to allow petitioners to unjustly enrich
themselves at the expense of UCC.  This,
in effect, renders nugatory all the efforts and expenses of UCC in its quest to
secure justice, not to mention the undue delay in disposing of this case
prejudicial to the administration of justice.


Next,
petitioners aver that the November 8, 1995 second alias writ of execution,
implemented in the June 27, 1997 Order of the trial court, varied the judgment
in Civil Case No. 9165 resulting in the deprivation of their property without
due process.


Their argument
is fallacious.


Suffice it to
state that the final decision sought to be enforced in the alias writ only
pertains to the area covered by TCT No. 73620, not to the other two
unregistered lots.  The said writ was
intended only for the execution of the judgment respecting one and the same
parcel of land which, as elucidated earlier, underwent series of transfer from
Rose Packing (TCT No. 73620) to PCIB (TCT No. 286176) and later to petitioner
Knecht, Inc. (TCT No. 613113).  As aptly
found by the CA:


âx x
x  what is being commanded to be
conveyed in the judgment is Lot 2, Parcel 20, Plan 11-8099, Amd-2, 
formerly
covered by TCT No. 73620, 
Book No. T-645, Page No. 20 of the Registry of
Deeds of Rizal, 
presently covered by TCT No. 613113, 
due to what
respondent 
UCC claims
 to be 
anomalous transfers. 
  Verily, 
not because the title to a parcel
of land is cancelled and replaced by a new one makes it a new or different
lot.â
[36]


Lastly,
petitioners submit that the November 8, 1995 second alias writ of execution
cannot be implemented by the June 27, 1997 Order of the trial court on the ground
that the said writ had already expired and, therefore, had become 
functus
officio
 pursuant to former Section 11, Rule 39 of the Rules of Civil
Procedure. We quote with approval the following disquisition of the CA in
rejecting petitionersâ argument:


âPetitioners protestation that the
second alias writ of execution dated November 8, 1995 could no longer be
enforced after its life span of (sixty) 60 days is incorrect.  At the present times, the life span of a
writ of execution is without limit for as long as the judgment has not been
satisfied, although it is returnable to the court issuing it immediately after
the judgment has been satisfied in part or in full.  If the judgment cannot be satisfied in full within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the writ, the officerâs duty is to report to the court
and state the reason therefor (Section 14, Rule 39, 1997 Rules).  There is, therefore, no more need to ask an
alias writ of execution under the new Rules.â
[37]


To be sure, the
expiration of the second alias writ is attributable to petitioners alone who
deliberately caused the filing of numerous and unmeritorious petitions with the
CA and this Court to thwart the long-delayed execution of the final and
executory Decision in Civil Case No. 9165.


It may now be
trite, but apt, to stress that the Rules of Court âshall be liberally construed
in order to promote their objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive
disposition of every action and proceeding.â
[38]
 They are mere tools designed to
facilitate the attainment of justice. Any rigid application of the rules which
would tend to frustrate, rather than promote, substantial justice is abhorred.
[39]


Every litigation
must come to an end.  While a litigantâs
right to initiate an action in court is fully respected, however, once his case
has been adjudicated by a competent court in a valid final judgment, he should
not be permitted to initiate similar suits hoping to secure a favorable ruling,
for this will result to endless litigations detrimental to the administration
of justice, as in this case.


WHEREFORE
, the instant petition is DENIED and
the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 47978 is
AFFIRMED.  Treble costs against
petitioners.

CA-G.R. SP No 33852 was consolidated with CA-G.R. SP
No. 33357, a petition also initiated by Knecht, Inc. to assail the order issued
by the RTC, Branch 73, Antipolo, Rizal which dropped Rose Packing as a party
litigant in the expropriation action commenced by the Municipality of Cainta,
Rizal over the land covered by TCT No. 73620.


   
Like CA-G.R.
SP No 33852, CA-G.R. SP No. 33357 was also dismissed by the CA, reiterating
that by virtue of the CFI Decision in Civil Case No. 9165 which had long become
final and executory, Rose Packing has been divested of any title, right and
interest over the subject property and that, for all intent and purposes, UCC
has become its owner.  Thus, Rose
Packing is clearly not a real party in interest to question the expropriation
action filed by the Municipality of Cainta, Rizal over the subject land.
