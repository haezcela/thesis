SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM, PETITIONER,
VS. COMMISSION ON AUDIT, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




BELLOSILLO, J.:


THE FUNDS
contributed to the Social Security System (SSS) are not only imbued with public
interest, they are part and parcel of the fruits of the workersâ labors pooled
into one enormous trust fund under the administration of the System designed to
insure against the vicissitudes and hazards of their working lives. In a very
real sense, the trust funds are the workersâ property which they could turn to
when necessity beckons and are thus more personal to them than the taxes they
pay. It is therefore only fair and proper that charges against the trust fund
be strictly scrutinized for every lawful and judicious opportunity to keep it
intact and viable in the interest of enhancing the welfare of their true and
ultimate beneficiaries.


This is a
petition for certiorari under Rule 64 of the 
1997 Rules of Civil Procedure 
praying
that this Court assess against the workersâ social security fund the amount of 
P
5,000.00
as contract signing bonus of each official and employee of the SSS. The
gratuity emanated from the collective negotiation agreement (CNA) executed on
10 July 1996 between the Social Security Commission (SSC) in behalf of the SSS
and the Alert and Concerned Employees for Better SSS (ACCESS), the sole and
exclusive negotiating agent for employees of the SSS.
[1]
 In
particular, Art. XIII of the CNA provided -


As a gesture of
 
good will
and benevolence, the Management agrees that once the Collective Negotiation
Agreement is approved and signed by the parties, Management shall grant each
official and employee of the SYSTEM the amount of P5,000.00 as contract signing
bonus.
[2]


To fund this undertaking, the SSC allocated 
P
15,000,000.00 in the
budgetary appropriation of the SSS.
[3]


On 18 February
1997 the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) declared as illegal the
contract signing bonus which the CNA authorized to be distributed among the
personnel of the SSS.
[4]
 
On 1 July
1997 the SSS Corporate Auditor disallowed fund releases for the signing bonus
since it was âan allowance in the form of additional compensation prohibited by
the Constitution.â
[5]


Two (2) years
later, in a letter dated 29 September 1999, ACCESS appealed the disallowance to
the Commission on Audit (COA).
[6]
 
On 5 July
2001 despite the delay in the filing of the appeal, a procedural matter which
COA considered to be inconsequential,
[7]
 COA
affirmed the disallowance and ruled that the grant of the signing bonus was
improper.
[8]
 It held
that the provision on the signing bonus in the CNA had no legal basis since
Sec. 16 of 
RA 7658 
(1989)
[9]
 had
repealed the authority of the SSC to fix the compensation of its personnel.
[10]
 Hence the
instant petition which, curiously, was filed in the name of the Social Security
System (and not ACCESS) by authority of the officer-in-charge for the SSS
[11]
 through
its legal staff.
[12]


Petitioner SSS
argues that a signing bonus may be granted upon the conclusion of negotiations
leading to the execution of a CNA where it is specifically authorized by law
and that in the case at bar such legal authority is found in Sec. 3, par. (c),
of 
RA 1161 
as amended (Charter of the SSS) which allows the SSC to fix
the compensation of its personnel. On the other hand, respondent COA asserts
that the authority of the SSC to fix the compensation of its personnel has been
repealed by Secs. 12 and 16 of 
RA 6758 
and is therefore no longer
effective.


We find no
legitimate and compelling reason to reverse the COA. To begin with, the instant
petition is fatally defective. It was filed in the name of the SSS although no
directive from the SSC authorized the instant suit and only the
officer-in-charge in behalf of petitioner executed the purported directive.
Clearly, this is irregular since under Sec. 4, par. 10, in relation to par. 7,
[13]
 
RA
1161 
as amended by 
RA 8282 (The Social Security Act of 1997, 
which
was already effective
[14]
 
when the
instant petition was filed), it is the SSC as a collegiate body which has the
power to approve, confirm, pass upon or review the action of the SSS to sue in
court. Moreover, the appearance of the internal legal staff of the SSS as
counsel in the present proceedings is similarly questionable because under both

RA 1161 
and 
RA 8282 
it is the Department of Justice (DoJ) that
has the authority to act as counsel of the SSS.
[15]
 
It is well
settled that the legality of the representation of an unauthorized counsel may
be raised at any stage of the proceedings
[16]
 
and that
such illicit representation produces no legal effect.
[17]
 Since
nothing in the case at bar shows that the approval or ratification of the SSC
has been undertaken in the manner prescribed by law and that the DoJ has not
delegated the authority to act as counsel and appear herein, the instant
petition must necessarily fail. These procedural deficiencies are serious
matters which this Court cannot take lightly and simply ignore since the SSS is
in reality confessing judgment to charge expenditure against the trust fund
under its custodianship.


In 
Premium
Marble Resources v. Court of Appeals
[18]
 
we held
that no person, not even its officers, could validly sue in behalf of a
corporation in the absence of any resolution from the governing body
authorizing the filing of such suit. Moreover, where the corporate officerâs
power as an agent of the corporation did not derive from such resolution, it
would nonetheless be necessary to show a clear source of authority from the
charter, the by-laws or the implied acts of the governing body.
[19]

Unfortunately there is no palpable evidence in the records to show that the
officer-in-charge could all by himself order the filing of the instant petition
without the intervention of the SSC, nor that the legal staff of SSS could act
as its counsel and appear therein without the intervention of the DoJ. The
power of attorney supposedly authorizing this suit as well as the signature of
the legal counsel appearing on the signing page of the instant petition is
therefore ineffectual.


Indeed we find
no merit in the claim that the employees and officers of SSS are entitled to
the signing bonus provided for in the CNA. In the first place, the process of collective
negotiations in the public sector does not encompass terms and conditions of
employment requiring the appropriation of public funds -


Sec. 13. Terms and conditions of
employment or improvements thereof, except those that are fixed by law, may be
the subject of negotiations between duly recognized employeesâ organizations
and appropriate government authorities.
[20]


More particularly -


Sec. 3. Those that require
appropriation of funds, such as the following, are not negotiable: (a) Increase
in salary emoluments and other allowances not presently provided for by law;
(b) Facilities requiring capital outlays; (c) Car plan; (d) Provident fund; (e)
Special hospitalization, medical and dental services; (f) Rice/sugar/other
subsidies; (g) Travel expenses; (h) Increase in retirement benefits.


Sec. 4. Matters that involve the
exercise of management prerogatives, such as the following, are likewise not
subject to negotiation: (a) Appointment; (b) Promotion; (c) Assignment/Detail;
(d) Reclassification/ upgrading of position; (e) Revision of compensation
structure; (f) Penalties imposed as a result of disciplinary actions; (g)
Selection of personnel to attend seminar, trainings, study grants; (h)
Distribution of work load; (I) External communication linkages.
[21]


Petitioner
however argues that the charter of SSS authorizes the SSC to fix the
compensation of its employees and officers so that in reality the signing bonus
is merely the fruit of the exercise of such fundamental power. On this issue,
we have to explain the relevant amendments to the SSS charter in relation to
the passage of 
RA 6758 
(1989) entitled 
âAn Act Prescribing a Revised
Compensation and Position Classification in the Government and for other
Purposes.â


When the signing
bonus was bestowed upon each employee and officer of the SSS on 10 July 1996,
which was earlier approved by the SSC on 3 July 1996, the governing charter of
the SSS was 
RA 1161 
as amended by Sec. 1, 
RA 2658, 
and Sec. 1, 
PD
735. 
Under this amended statute, the SSC was empowered to âappoint an
actuary, and such other personnel as may be deemed necessaryâ and to âfix their
compensation.â
[22]
 
The law
also provided that âthe personnel of the SSS shall be selected only from civil
service eligibles and be subject to civil service rules and regulations.â
[23]


On 9 August 1989
Congress passed 
RA 6758 
which took effect on 1 July 1989.
[24]
 Its goal
was to âprovide equal pay for substantially equal work and to base differences
in pay upon substantive differences in duties and responsibilities, and
qualification requirements of the positions.â
[25]
 
Towards
this end, 
RA 6758 
provided for the consolidation of allowances and
compensation in the prescribed standardized salary rates except certain
specified allowances
[26]
 and such
other additional compensation as may be determined by the Department of Budget
and Management.
[27]
 
The law
also repealed â[a]ll laws, decrees, executive orders, corporate charters, and
other issuances or parts thereof, that exempt agencies from the coverage of the
System, or that authorize and fix position classification, salaries, pay rates
or allowances of specified positions, or groups of officials and employees or
of agencies, which are inconsistent with the System, including the proviso
under Section 2 and Section 16 of Presidential Decree No. 985.â
[28]


Although it was
the clear policy intent of 
RA 6758 
to standardize salary rates among
government personnel, the Legislature under Secs. 12
[29]
 and 17
[30]
 
of the law
nonetheless saw the need for equity and justice in adopting the policy of
non-diminution of pay when it authorized incumbents as of 1 July 1989 to
receive salaries and/or allowances over and above those authorized by 
RA
6758. 
In 
Philippine Ports Authority v. Commission on Audit
[31]
 
we held
that no financial or non-financial incentive could be awarded to employees of
government owned and controlled corporations aside from benefits which were
being received by incumbent officials and employees as of 1 July 1989. This
Court also observed -


The consequential outcome, under
sections 12 and 17, is that if the incumbent resigns or is promoted to a higher
position, his successor is no longer entitled to his predecessorâs RATA
privilege x x x or to the transition allowance x x x x [A]fter July 1, 1989,
additional financial incentives such as RATA may no longer be given by GOCCs
with the exception of those which were authorized to be continued under Section
12 of RA 6758.


Evidently, while

RA 6758 
intended to do away with multiple allowances and other incentive
packages and the resulting differences in compensation among government
personnel, the statute clearly did not revoke existing benefits being enjoyed
by incumbents of government positions at the time of the passage of 
RA 6758 
by
virtue of Secs. 12 and 17 thereof. In previous rulings of this Court, among the
financial and non-financial incentives which we allowed certain government
employees to enjoy after the effectivity of 
RA 6758 
were car plan
benefits
[32]
 
and
educational funding assistance
[33]
 for
incumbents of existing positions as of 1 July 1989 until such gratuity packages
were gradually phased out.


We have no doubt
that 
RA 6758 
modified, if not repealed, Sec. 3, par. (c), of 
RA 1161 
as
amended, at least insofar as it concerned the authority of SSC to fix the compensation
of SSS employees and officers. This means that whatever salaries and other
financial and non-financial inducements that the SSC was minded to fix for
them, the compensation must comply with the terms of 
RA 6758. 
Consequently,
only the remuneration which was being offered as of 1 July 1989, and which was
then being enjoyed by incumbent SSS employees and officers, could be availed of
exclusively by the same employees and officers separate from and independent of
the prescribed standardized salary rates. Unfortunately, however, the signing
bonus in question did not qualify under Secs. 12 and 17 of 
RA 6758. 
It
was non-existent as of 1 July 1989 as it accrued only in 1996 when the CNA was
entered into by and between SSC and ACCESS. The signing bonus therefore could
not have been included in the salutary provisions of the statute nor would it
be legal to disburse to the intended recipients.


Philippine
International Trading Corporation v. Commission on Audit
[34]
 
is
instructive on this point. Like the SSS, the Philippine International Trading
Corporation (PITC) is a government-owned and controlled corporation which was
created under 
PD 252 
(1973) primarily for the purpose of promoting and
developing Philippine trade in pursuance of national economic development. In
the same judgment which affirmed the car financing program and allied
incentives being implemented prior to 1 July 1989 we held that the charter of
PITC was impliedly repealed by 
RA 6758 
-


We deem it necessary though to resolve
the third issue as to whether PITC is exempt from PD 985 as subsequently
amended by RA 6758. According to petitioner, PITCâs Revised Charter, PD 1071
dated January 25, 1977, as amended by EO 756 dated December 29, 1981, and
further amended by EO 1067 dated November 25, 1985, expressly exempted PITC
from the Office of the Compensation and Position Classification (OCPC) rules
and regulations. Petitioner cites Section 28 of P.D. 1071; Section 6 of EO 756;
and Section 3 of EO 1067. According to the COA in its Decision No. 98-048 dated
January 27, 1998, the exemption granted to the PITC has been repealed and
revoked by the repealing provisions of RA 6758, particularly Section 16 thereof
which provides:


Sec. 16. Repeal of Special Salary
Laws and Regulations. - All laws, decrees, executive orders, corporate
charters, and other issuances or parts thereof, that exempt agencies from the
coverage of the System, or that authorize and fix position classifications,
salaries, pay rates or allowances of specified positions, or groups of
officials, and employees or of agencies, which are inconsistent with the
System, including the proviso under Section 2 and Section 16 of PD No. 985 are
hereby repealed.


To this, [PITC] argues that RA 6758
which is a law of general application cannot repeal provisions of the Revised
Charter of PITC and its amendatory laws expressly exempting PITC from OCPC
coverage being special laws x x x x In the case at bar, the repeal by Section
16 of RA 6758 of âall corporate charters that exempt agencies from the coverage
of the Systemâ was clear and expressed necessarily to achieve the purposes for
which the law was enacted, that is, the standardization of salaries of all
employees in government owned and / or controlled corporations to achieve âequal
pay for substantially equal work.â Henceforth, PITC should now be considered as
covered by laws prescribing a compensation and position classification system
in the government including RA 6758. This is without prejudice, however, as
discussed above, to the non-diminution of pay of incumbents as of July 1, 1989
as provided in Sections 12 and 17 of said law.


So we also rule in the instant case involving the charter of the SSS or 
RA
1161 
as amended.


The enactment of

RA 8282 
entitled 
âThe Social Security Act of 1997â 
does not
change our holding. While it is true that Sec. 3, par. (c), of 
RA 8282 
expressly
exempted the SSS from the provisions of 
RA 6758 
and 
RA 7430 (The
Attrition Law of 1992) 
thus -


The Commission, upon the
recommendation of the SSS President, shall appoint an actuary and such other
personnel as may be deemed necessary; fix their reasonable compensation,
allowances and other benefits x x x x [t]hat the personnel of the SSS shall be
selected only from civil service eligibles and be subject to civil service
rules and regulations: Provided, finally, That the SSS shall be exempt from the
provisions of Republic Act No. 6758 and Republic Act No. 7430,


it bears emphasis that 
RA 8282 
took effect only on 23 May 1997,
i.e., fifteen (15) days after its complete publication in two (2) newspapers of
general circulation on 7 May 1997
[35]
 and 8 May
1997.
[36]
 It holds
to reason that the prospective application of the statute renders irrelevant to
the case at bar whatever effects this exemption may have on the power of the
SSC to fix the compensation of SSS personnel. Ironically, 
RA 8282 
in
fact buttresses our ruling that the signing bonus cannot escape the provisions
of 
RA 6758. 
The need to expressly stipulate the exemption of the SSS can
only mean that prior to the effectivity of 
RA 8282, 
the SSS was subject
to 
RA 6758 
and even 
RA 7430 
for, otherwise, there would have been
no reason to rope in such provision in 
RA 8282.


This Court has
been very consistent in characterizing the funds being administered by SSS as a
trust fund for the welfare and benefit of workers and employees in the private
sector.
[37]
 In 
United
Christian Missionary v. Social Security Commission
[38]
 
we were
unequivocal in declaring the funds contributed to the Social Security System by
compulsion of law as funds belonging to the members which were merely held in
trust by the government, and resolutely imposed the duty upon the trustee to
desist from any and all acts which would diminish the property rights of owners
and beneficiaries of the trust fund. Consistent with this declaration, it would
indeed be very reasonable to construe the authority of the SSC to provide for
the compensation of SSS personnel in accordance with the established rules
governing the remuneration of trustees -


x x x x the modern rule is to give
the trustee a reasonable remuneration for his skill and industry x x x x In
deciding what is a reasonable compensation for a trustee the court will
consider the amount of income and capital received and disbursed, the pay
customarily given to agents or servants for similar work, the success or
failure of the work of the trustee, any unusual skill which the trustee had and
used, the amount of risk and responsibility, the time consumed, the character
of the work done (whether routine or of unusual difficulty) and any other
factors which prove the worth of the trusteeâs services to the cestuis x x x x
The court has power to make extraordinary compensation allowances, but will not
do so unless the trustee can prove that he has performed work beyond the ordinary
duties of his office and has engaged in especially arduous work.
[39]


On the basis of
the foregoing pronouncement, we do not find the signing bonus to be a truly
reasonable compensation. The gratuity was of course the SSCâs gesture of good
will and benevolence for the conclusion of collective negotiations between SSC
and ACCESS, as the CNA would itself state, but for what objective? Agitation
and propaganda which are so commonly practiced in private sector
labor-management relations have no place in the bureaucracy and that only a
peaceful collective negotiation which is concluded within a reasonable time
must be the standard for interaction in the public sector. This desired conduct
among civil servants should not come, we must stress, with a price tag which is
what the signing bonus appears to be.
