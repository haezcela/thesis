RENE U. GOLANGCO, COMPLAINANT,
VS. JUDGE CANDIDO VILLANUEVA, RESPONDENT.

R E S O L U T I O N




DAVIDE, JR., C.J.:


This is the
second administrative case filed by Rene Golangco (hereafter RENE) against
herein respondent Judge Candido Villanueva in connection with Civil Case No.
92-3647, entitled 
Ma. Lucia Carlos Golangco v. Rene Uy Golangco,
 for the
declaration of nullity of marriage, with prayers for damages, support and
custody, and for a writ of preliminary injunction. 


The antecedent
facts are as follows:


On 21 July 1994,
respondent Judge issued an order
[1]
 granting custody 
pendente lite

of the partiesâ minor children to Ma. Lucia C. Golangco (hereafter LUCIA), and
visitation rights to RENE.  The said
order was reiterated in the order of 26 August 1994.  Both orders were questioned by RENE before the Court of Appeals
by way of a petition for 
certiorari
, which was however denied.
[2]
 Hence, RENE brought the matter to
us in G.R. No. 120381.  In our
Resolution of 17 July 1995, the petition was denied for his failure to show
that grave abuse of discretion was committed by the Court of Appeals.


On 15 August
1995, LUCIA filed with the trial court a motion for reconsideration of the 21
July 1994 Order, with urgent prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction. She
alleged that RENE was harassing the children and the officials of the school
where they were enrolled.  He was
verbally and physically abusing his sons, which prompted LUCIA to file a
complaint against him for slight physical injuries.  The next day, respondent Judge Villanueva issued a temporary
restraining order.


On 4 October
1995, after due hearing, respondent Judge ordered the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction enjoining and restraining RENE from âharassing,
intimidating and threatening his minor children and the school officials of
International School and the International Montessori School and other persons
who may be looking after the welfare of said minors.â
[3]
 RENE assailed the order before the
Court of Appeals via a petition for 
certiorari
, which was, however,
dismissed on the ground of forum-shopping.  Thus, he filed a petition for review with this Court, which was docketed
as G.R. No. 124724.  In our decision of
22 December 1997,
[4]
 we ruled that there was no
forum-shopping, but we upheld the propriety of the issuance of the writ of
preliminary injunction.


On 19 May 1997
and 17 September 1999, RENE filed with the trial court motions to lift the writ
of preliminary injunction. He alleged that the criminal case for slight
physical injuries, which arose out of the alleged violence he inflicted on his
son and which served as the basis for the issuance of the writ of preliminary
injunction, had already been dismissed for insufficiency of evidence.
[5]


On 10 January
2000, respondent Judge denied the motion to lift the writ of preliminary
injunction on the ground of absence of any allegation under oath or assurance
supported by a bond that in the event the writ were dissolved, the alleged
harassment, intimidation or threats upon the partiesâ children would not occur
again.
[6]


On 3 October
2000, Rene again filed a motion to lift the writ of injunction and manifested
his desire to comply with the requirements laid down by the Rules of
Court.  This motion was strongly opposed
by LUCIA.  


On 20 November
2000, RENE submitted, in support of said motion, his Compliance, as well as his
affidavit assuring the court that he would never harass, intimidate or threaten
his children.


On 29 November
2000 and 6 February 2001, RENE filed motions to immediately resolve the motion
for the dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction.


Alleging, among
other things, the inaction on his motions by respondent Judge, RENE wrote the
Office of the Court of Administrator several times.  Later, he asked that his 16 March 2001 letter be treated as his
complaint.


In his Comment dated
17 April 2001, respondent Judge stated that since the presentation of evidence
by both parties had been completed, the matter of custody would better be
resolved in the decision in the main case.  If such matter would be resolved ahead of the decision in the main case,
the aggrieved party would most probably elevate it again by 
certiorari

to the Court of Appeals.  This could
further delay the rendition of the decision in the main case as what happened
when the Orders of 21 July 1994 and 4 October 1995 were elevated by 
certiorari

to the Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court, which necessitated the
elevation of the entire records to the said appellate courts and which resulted
in the suspension of proceedings.


Likewise, the
Report and Recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator discloses
that, in a phone inquiry, respondent Judge admitted that he did not resolve
RENEâs third motion to lift the writ of preliminary injunction because he
believed that the custody of the children, which was the subject of such
motion, should be determined in the main case for the declaration of nullity of
the marriage.


The Office of
the Court Administrator, through then Acting Court Administrator Zenaida N.
ElepaÃ±o, found unacceptable the excuse proffered by the respondent Judge for
not resolving the motion to lift the writ of injunction. It recommended the
filing of an administrative case against respondent Judge and the imposition of
a fine in the amount of 
P
1,000 for his failure to resolve the motion
within the reglementary period.


In our
resolution of 3 September 2001, RENEâs letter-complaint was docketed as a
regular administrative matter.


On 26 November
2001, respondent Judge submitted his decision dated 16 November 2001 in Civil
Case No. 92-3647, which, among other things, denied RENEâs motion to lift the
writ of preliminary injunction and made permanent the writ issued against RENE.


Section 15,
Paragraph 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution mandates that all cases or
matters must be decided or resolved by trial courts within three months from
the date of submission for determination.  Supreme Court Circular No. 13 dated 1 July 1987 directs judges to
observe scrupulously the periods prescribed by the Constitution for the
adjudication and resolution of all cases or matters submitted in their
courts.  In the same vein, the Code of
Judicial Conduct provides that a judge should administer justice impartially
and without delay
[7]
 and that a judge shall dispose of
the courtâs business promptly and decide cases within the required periods.
[8]


The mandate to
promptly dispose of cases or matters has been held by this Court to apply also
to motions or interlocutory matters or incidents pending before a magistrate.
[9]
 Unreasonable delay of a judge in
resolving a pending incident is a violation of the norms of judicial conduct
and constitutes gross inefficiency that warrants the imposition of an
administrative sanction against the defaulting magistrate.
[10]


In this case,
respondent Judge Candido Villanueva denied on 10 January 2000 RENEâs first and
second motions for the lifting of the writ of preliminary injunction.  Yet, RENE persisted; he filed a third motion
for the dissolution of the writ, and tried to comply with the requirements stated
in the said Order.  This was followed by
motions for the early resolution of the motion to lift the writ.  It is understandable why RENE was persistent
because although the writ only restrained him from harassing, intimidating and
threatening his children and the school officials, he was also deprived of the
visitation rights accorded him by the 21 July 1994 Order. It must have been
hard and painful for him as a father not to be able to see and enjoy the
company of his children.  As stated in
his affidavit:
[11]


12.  Further, the Court should appreciate the irreparable damage
suffered by affiant as a result of the continuation and maintenance of the writ
of injunction and that has portrayed herein respondent as an ogre â¦ and this
negative perception may have been etched in the tender and responsible minds of
a partyâs 
[sic]
 common children which ought to be immediately erased
lest it becomes permanently imprinted and made a prevailing mindset of the
children; the children are both boys and require paternal company, affection
and guidance, all of which cannot be provided by herein petitioner and each day
that these boys are deprived of paternal company, affection and guidance,
serves to deter their full emotional growth and development.


â¦


14.  Affiantâs frustrations in his ability to see and enjoy the
company of his own flesh and blood are unquantifiable â¦.


Despite the
motions for early resolution, RENEâs motion to lift the writ of preliminary
injunction remained unacted upon by the Judge within the prescribed three-month
period. It was resolved only after a year when the decision in the main case
was rendered.


The reason
proffered by respondent Judge for his inaction on the motion is unacceptable.
We agree with then Acting Court Administrator ElepaÃ±o that he should not have
anticipated what the parties were likely to do after issuing an order on the
motion, and then base his action or inaction on such speculation.  What he should have done was simply to deny
the motion and state his reason that the custody of the children, which was the
subject of the motion to dissolve the writ of preliminary injunction, would be
better determined in the main case.  Bombarded though he might be with motions and other incidents in this
case, as well as in other cases, respondent Judge was not justified in ignoring
RENEâs motion to lift the writ of preliminary injunction, especially that his
attention thereto was twice called in RENEâs motions for early resolution of
the said motion.


In our decision
of 4 September 1997 in the first administrative case, A.M. No. RTJ- 96-1355,
filed by RENE against herein respondent Judge in connection with Civil Case No.
92-3647, this Court observed that respondent Judge was indeed âcaught in the
cross-fireâ in this âemotionally-charged drama between a husband and a wife
fighting for the custody of their children,â and yet he remained patient to
resolve the conflict.  He should not
have allowed his patience to wear thin.  However unmeritorious RENEâs motion might have been, he must have
resolved it with reasonable dispatch, keeping in mind his bounden duty to
promptly dispose of all matters submitted for determination.


WHEREFORE,
 respondent Judge Candido Villanueva
is hereby ADMONISHED for his failure to act within the reglementary period on
the motion of Rene Golangco for the lifting of the writ of preliminary
injunction.  He is DIRECTED to promptly
dispose of all matters submitted to him for resolution in all cases before him,
with a WARNING that the commission in the future of the same or similar acts
shall be dealt with more severely.


SO ORDERED.
