JOSELITO SALUNDAY AND DANILO M. MANIQUIZ, COMPLAINANTS, VS. JUSTICE EUGENIO S. LABITORIA, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


The present administrative case stemmed from the 
affidavit-complaint
[1]
 filed by Joselito P. Salunday and Danilo 
M. Maniquiz on October 9, 2000 against Justice Eugenio S. Labitoria, 
Associate 
Justice of the Court of Appeals, for grave misconduct and/or conduct 
unbecoming 
a member of the judiciary.


In their complaint, Salunday and Maniquiz alleged that on 
August 15, 2000, 
they learned from the office of Senator Franklin M. Drilon that there is
 an 
appropriation for the construction of a justice hall to house a branch 
of the 
Regional Trial Court and another branch of the Municipal Trial Court in 
Bambang, 
Nueva Vizcaya.


On August 30, 2000, Justice Eugenio S. Labitoria transmitted to
 then Justice 
Secretary Artemio G. Tuquero, former Justice of the Court of Appeals, 
the 
Resolution
[2]
 of 
the Integrated Bar of 
the Philippines, Nueva Vizcaya Chapter, recommending the construction of
 the 
justice hall on the lot donated by the late RTC Judge Catalino M. 
RaÃ±ada. 
Complainants claimed that the reason why Justice Labitoria recommended 
the 
RaÃ±ada property is because it is located at the back of the Juel Garden 
Hotel 
owned by him.


On October 3, 2000, complainants went to the office of 
Secretary Tuquero at 
the Department of Justice, Padre Faura, Manila, to submit the letter of 
Congressman Carlos Padilla recommending them as contractors. While 
waiting 
outside, Justice Labitoria came out of the Secretary's room and, upon 
seeing 
them, shouted and told them not to intervene in the selection of the 
proposed 
site for the justice hall. Justice Labitoria further yelled, "Who are 
you to 
confuse the Department of Justice? Refrain from doing acts pertaining to
 the 
construction of the hall of justice."


Complainants also alleged that on October 6, 2000, Justice 
Labitoria went to 
the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and contacted Engr. 
Carlos M. 
Lopez, the official who would conduct the inspection of the proposed 
sites. 
Justice Labitoria even wrote Engr. Arturo M. Santos, also of the DPWH, 
to 
contest the result of the inspection previously conducted, claiming that
 âthe 
area of the proposed hall of justice was personally bulldozed and 
leveled upon 
my instruction using my personal equipment and money.â
[3]
 According to 
complainants, Justice 
Labitoria recommended the RaÃ±ada property for his financial 
benefit.


Complainants thus assert that Justice Labitoria should be found
 guilty of 
gross misconduct and penalized accordingly.


In his comment, Justice Labitoria vehemently denied 
complainants' 
allegations, claiming that this is the first time in his thirty (30) 
years of 
service in the judiciary that he is being charged with gross misconduct 
and/or 
conduct unbecoming of a public official.


Justice Labitoria narrated the incidents on October 3, 2000. On
 that day, 
upon request of former Congressman William Claver, Justice Labitoria 
accompanied 
him to the office of Secretary Tuquero for some official transactions. 
He agreed 
to join Congressman Claver since he wanted to follow up with Secretary 
Tuquero 
the construction of the proposed hall of justice. When they reached 
Secretary 
Tuqueroâs office, he saw complainant Danilo Maniquiz, his townmate from 
Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. He then asked Maniquiz, "O, nandito pala kayo,
 
pinapalo-up ninyo ang justice hall?" The latter replied, "Opo." He also 
saw 
complainant Joselito Salunday. Before he left the room, he heard 
Salunday 
suggesting to Secretary Tuquero to transfer the site of the justice hall
 from 
the RaÃ±ada property to the lot donated by Atty. Antonio Dumlao, saying 
he 
(Salunday) will undertake the construction of the building per his 
agreement 
with Mayor Pepito Balgos of Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya.


When Maniquiz came out of Secretary Tuqueroâs office, Justice 
Labitoria told 
him that the justice hall should be built at the RaÃ±ada lot since it is 
in the 
name of the Department of Justice (DOJ), registered as early as 
September 11, 
1998 as shown by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 110480 of the 
Registry of 
Deeds of Nueva Vizcaya. Justice Labitoria explained that Judge RaÃ±ada, 
during 
his lifetime, donated the lot to then Mayor Luisa Lloren Cuaresma who, 
in turn, 
donated the same to the DOJ. At any rate, he advised Salunday that he 
could bid 
for the construction of the justice hall on the RaÃ±ada 
property.


Justice Labitoria further explained that his involvement in the
 construction 
of the proposed justice hall started in 1995 when Mayor Cuaresma asked 
him to 
help in following up the status of the project. Both complainants filed 
the 
instant administrative case against him when he opposed the transfer of 
the site 
from the RaÃ±ada property to the Dumlao property and refused to recommend
 them as 
contractors. He did not recommend the RaÃ±ada property for the financial 
gain of 
the Juel Garden Hotel for the following reasons: first, he recommended 
the place 
to be the site of the justice hall as early as 1996, but the hotel was 
built 
much later or in 1997 to 1998; second, the owner of the Juel Garden is a
 
corporation wherein his wife is one of its stockholders; third, the 
RaÃ±ada 
property is not beside the Juel Garden Hotel - it is located 150 meters 
away and 
is separated from the hotel by a ravine and a municipal road. On the 
contrary, 
the Dumlao property is nearer to the hotel, being only 130 meters 
away.


Justice Labitoria stressed that his interest in the project is 
spurred, not 
by a dishonest purpose, but mainly by his desire to help his townmates 
who can 
be spared of more time and expenses in travelling to the âCapitol to 
attend 
trial of their cases.â Lastly, Salunday is not worthy of belief because 
he has 
been charged with violations of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 several 
times.


In our Resolution dated June 4, 2001,
[4]
 we referred the case to retired 
Supreme 
Court Justice Justo P. Torres, Jr. âfor recommendation.â
[5]
 


In a Resolution
[6]
 dated November 27, 
2001, the Court En Banc accepted this case referred to it 
en 
consulta
 
by the Third Division.


In his Report and Recommendation, Justice Torres recommended 
that the 
complaint be dismissed but that respondent Justice Labitoria be 
admonished to 
refrain from doing âsimilar acts as may taint his personal image as a 
magistrate.â Justice Torres' Report and Recommendation partly 
reads:




âComplainants ascribe to respondent two acts allegedly 
amounting to gross 
misconduct and/or conduct unbecoming a member of the 
judiciary;


that respondent shouted at them in the office of 
then Secretary of Justice, 
Justice Tuquero on October 3, 2000; and 


acts of respondent that were allegedly committed in
 the furtherance of his 
desire to benefit financially and take advantage of his position as 
member of 
the judiciary by persuading, inducing or influencing the Department of 
Justice 
to decide that the hall of justice of Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya be 
constructed 
beside the Juel Garden Hotel which is wholly owned by Juel Estate Land 
Inc., a 
corporation organized out of the assets of the spouses Labitoria. 


"On the alleged incident that took place on October 3, 2000, the version
 
of the respondent is more worthy of belief, as it is supported by the 
affidavit 
of a disinterested and credible man in the person of Justice Artemio G. 
Tuquero. 
x x x. Complainants allege that respondent shouted at them at the 
receiving 
area, after respondent came out of Justice Tuqueroâs office. However, 
contrary 
thereto, the two complainants could not have been together at that same 
moment 
because as attested by Justice Tuquero, and thereby corroborating 
respondentâs 
version, Mr. Salunday was left inside his office when respondent Justice
 
Labitoria followed Congressman Claver in the receiving area. Moreover, 
that 
there was such a shouting incident is belied by Justice Tuqueroâs 
statement that 
if there was any shouting or embarrassing words uttered by Justice 
Labitoria 
against complainants Mr. Salunday and Mr. Maniquiz, during that meeting 
on 
October 3, 2000, he should have known as the members of his staff or the
 
security guards in the corridor outside his office, would have reported 
to him. 
There was no report of any incident that happened between Justice 
Labitoria and 
the herein complainants. 

"Thus, with regard to the alleged incident on October 3, 2000, 
it is 
recommended that respondent be absolved of the charge.


"The second act complained of shall now be discussed: that of 
respondentâs 
alleged acts of influencing the Department of Justice to decide that the
 hall of 
justice of Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya, be constructed in the RaÃ±ada property
 which 
is beside respondentâs Juel Garden Hotel, in order for respondent to 
benefit 
financially thereby.


"The pleadings and annexes thereto, and records of the case 
show that 
respondent was instrumental from the beginning towards the preparation 
of the 
construction of a Justice Hall in Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya, upon the 
request of 
Mayor Cuaresma. It was also the Mayor who requested the respondent to 
help the 
municipality in the leveling of the RaÃ±ada property.


"It is apparent that as early as June 1996, the RaÃ±ada property
 was already 
donated (Rollo, p. 63) to the Municipality of Bambang and titled in the 
name of 
the Department of Justice on September 1, 1998. However, in August, 
2000, the 
herein complainants, being building contractors, became interested in 
the 
project upon learning of the nine million pesos appropriation therefor, 
and 
wanted the Dumlao property to be the site of the project. Respondent 
averred in 
his Comment that the complainants even went to his office and his 
residence 
pleading that he intercede in their favor for the transfer of site of 
the 
Justice Hall from the RaÃ±ada property to the Dumlao property. This, 
complainants 
did not deny in their Comment (should be Reply, Rollo, pp. 
104-106).


"Now, aside from the fact that the RaÃ±ada property has the 
advantage of being 
already titled in the name of the DOJ, whether or not respondent was 
following 
up in favor of the better site cannot be gleaned from the records of the
 case 
because the DPWH site inspection reports changed like a pendulum with 
every 
re-inspection of the two (2) proposed sites as can be observed in the 
inspection 
reports dated October 25, 1995 (Rollo, p. 51), October 2, 2000 (Rollo, 
p. 
119-120) and December 15, 2000 (Rollo, p. 88), in relation to the 
letters dated 
September 14, 2000 (written by Mayor Pepito Balgos, Rollo, p. 76) and 
October 6, 
2000 (written by respondent, Rollo, pp. 81-82). At any rate, it would 
not matter 
if the respondent is following-up in favor of the better site. The issue
 is 
whether or not the respondent overstepped the bounds of propriety when 
he went 
on following-up the construction of the hall of justice.


"It is submitted that complainantsâ allegation that respondent 
was 
influencing the DOJ in the selection of the site in furtherance of the 
latterâs 
desire to benefit financially because the RaÃ±ada property is beside his 
Juel 
Garden Hotel is, at best, speculative or conjectural. An allegation per 
se is no 
evidence.


"It must be noted that it was Mayor Cuaresma who requested the 
respondent in 
1995 to help the municipality of Bambang in following up the project. 
Respondentâs mistake assumably lies in that the moment he acceded to the
 said 
request, he became steadfast in his resolve to perform the task possibly
 as a 
civic duty.


"Respondentâs claim is that his only wish is the immediate 
construction of a 
Justice Hall to help the people of Southern Nueva Vizcaya ease their 
burden of 
wasted time and expenses in going to and from the capitol to attend 
trials of 
their cases.


"Respondentâs intention may be commendableâ that of 
facilitating the 
construction of a hall of justice in his hometown. Respondentâs 
intention to 
help his provincemates to have easy access to the hall of justice 
however lofty 
may, in the perception of some be misconstrued, given the facts 
appearing on 
record. While misconduct is one âsuch as affects his performance of his 
duties 
as an officer and not such only as affect his character as a private 
individual 
(Amosco vs. Magro, Ad. Matter No. 439-MTJ, Sept. 30, 1976, 73 SCRA 107),
 
nevertheless, respondent should not give complainants an occasion to 
perceive 
that he (respondent) is committing an act of impropriety or the 
appearance 
thereof in all his activities. While respondentâs acts of following-up 
the 
construction of the Justice Hall should not be overlooked, neither 
should he be 
penalized on the basis of suspicions derived from speculative 
inferences, such 
as, that the result would benefit him.


âThus, the second charge should likewise be dismissed for being
 speculative, 
but respondent should be admonished to refrain from doing similar acts 
as may 
taint his personal image as a magistrate.â
[7]
 


On January 22, 2002, the Court 
En Banc
 
issued a Resolution requiring 
the parties to manifest within ten (10) days from notice if they are 
willing to 
submit this case for decision on the basis of the pleadings 
filed.


On February 18, 2002, respondent Justice Labitoria filed a 
Manifestation 
submitting this case for decision based on the pleadings. Complainants, 

despite notice
, failed to file the required
 manifestation.


On the shouting incident which transpired in the DOJ on October
 3, 2000, we 
find respondentâs version to be more credible, being corroborated by the
 sworn 
statement
[8]
 of 
then Justice Secretary 
Artemio G. Tuquero. He attested that there was no report from the 
members of his 
staff and the guards that respondent shouted at the complainants. 
Surely, 
Justice Tuquero would have known if such an unusual incident transpired 
in his 
office. It bears emphasis that complainants failed to substantiate their
 
accusation with adequate proof. Their mere allegation is not equivalent 
to 
proof.
[9]




On the charge that respondent Justice recommended the 
construction of the 
hall of justice on the RaÃ±ada property because it is nearer the Juel 
Hotel of 
which he is the owner, we find the same unworthy of belief. The hotel is
 owned, 
not by respondent, but by a corporation of which his wife is only one of
 its 
stockholders. More telling is the fact that the construction of the 
justice hall 
on the Dumlao property proposed by complainants will be more beneficial 
to the 
Juel Hotel. As shown by a Sketch Plan
[10]
 
submitted by the respondent which was not contested by the complainants,
 âThe 
RaÃ±ada property is separated by a ravine and a road which is 150 meters 
away 
from Juel Hotel. Reaching the RaÃ±ada property from Juel Hotel is by 
circuitous 
way than the National Highway. The Dumlao property is nearer and more 
advantageous to Juel Hotel.
[11]
 


Moreover, there is no clear indication that in recommending the
 RaÃ±ada 
property, respondent was impelled by a desire to benefit financially. He
 
recommended that site because primarily it has been leveled with the use
 of his 
personal equipment upon the request of Mayor Cuaresma. Consequently, the
 
government will be able to save some public funds. Also, the fact that 
he was 
recommending the RaÃ±ada property as early as 1995 dispels any suspicion 
that his 
recommendation is anchored on his financial interest.


It is clear from the records that in charging herein respondent
 
administratively, complainants did not come to court with clean hands, 
so to 
speak. They have impure motive. They want the respondent to intercede 
with the 
Department of Justice and the Department of Public Works and Highways in
 order 
that they would be accredited as contractors of the hall of justice. 
They were 
turned down by the respondent. Next. They want the hall of justice to be
 
constructed on the Dumlao property where they would earn more as 
contractors. 
Again, respondent declined. Sensing that they may not bag the P9M 
contract, they 
turned the table on respondent Justice and charged him instead as the 
one with 
financial interest in insisting that the construction of the hall of 
justice 
should be on the RaÃ±ada property.


On the whole, we find that the instant administrative complaint
 is baseless 
and ill motivated.
