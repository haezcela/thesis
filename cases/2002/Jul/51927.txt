PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. ORLANDO JAVIER, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




KAPUNAN, J.:


On automatic
review is the decision dated March 2, 2000 of the Regional Trial Court of San
Jose, Occidental Mindoro, Branch 46, in Criminal Case No. R-4231, finding
herein accused-appellant Orlando Javier guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
of murder and imposing upon him the penalty of death.


In an
Information filed on September 4, 1997, accused-appellant was charged with
murder committed as follows:


That on or about 2nd day of
September, 1997 at around 6:30 oâclock in the evening, in Barangay San Roque
II, Municipality of San Jose, Province of Occidental Mindoro, Philippines and
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused being then armed
with a .45 Caliber, with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully
and feloniously, with treachery, attack, assault and shot with the said weapon
one Roberto Sunga y Revero, thereby inflicting upon the latter serious gunshot
wound in the chest, through and through, which caused his untimely death..
[1]


On arraignment,
accused-appellant entered a plea of 
âNot Guilty.â
 Trial ensued
thereafter. 


The prosecution
presented eight witnesses namely: Benedict Sta. Maria, Bobby Matira, Louie
Lingas, SPO2 Federico Reguyal, SPO4 Rolando Ungria, Dr. Nuela Manzanida,
Rodrigo Quirante, and Josephine Sunga.


Benedict Sta.
Maria testified that around 6:30 in the evening of September 2, 1997, he was on
his way home from the Seventh Day Adventist Church together with Bobby Matira,
Louie Lingas, and Roberto Dulay on board a Kawasaki-100 motorcycle.
[2]
 
When they
were in front of the San Roque II Elementary School, Sta. Maria saw
accused-appellant shoot the victim, Roberto Sunga, while both were on board a
tricycle.  Accused-appellant was on the
passenger side while the victim was the one driving.
[3]
 
After the
first shot, the victim fell down from the tricycle.  While sprawled on the ground, the victim raised his hand as if
pleading for his life.  Accused-appellant then approached the victim and pointed a short black
gun at him.  He pulled the trigger but
the gun did not discharge. At the time, Sta. Maria and his companions were
about six arms length away from the scene.
[4]
 
Thereafter,
accused-appellant went inside his house, came out and walked towards Sta. Maria
and his companions. When they saw accused-appellant approaching them with the
gun still in his hand, Sta. Maria and his companions left.
[5]
 
When
accused-appellant was no longer around, Sta. Maria and his companions
approached the victim who had a wound at the left side of his chest. They
looked for the victimâs relatives to inform them about the incident.  The victim was later on brought to the
Funeral Parlor.
[6]


Bobby Matira
corroborated Sta. Mariaâs testimony. He narrated that around 6:00 to 6:30 in
the evening of September 2, 1997, he was in the premises of the Seventh Day
Adventist Church in San Roque II together with his friends Benedict Sta. Maria,
Roberto Dulay and Louie Lingas.
[7]
 
They were
on their way home on board a motorcycle when they heard a gunshot in front of
the San Roque II Elementary School. When he looked at the direction where the
shot came from, he saw somebody sprawled on the ground and another man holding
a short black gun whom he later identified in court as accused-appellant.
[8]
 
When
witness and his companions saw accused-appellant approaching them, they
immediately left for fear that he might harm them. After a while, they returned
to the scene and found Robert Sunga lying on the ground already dead.
[9]


Louie Lingas
also gave a similar testimony. He stated that on September 2, 1997, around 6:30
in the evening, he was  having a snack
at a store near the Seventh Day Adventist Church together with Sta. Maria,
Matira and Dulay.  After eating, the
four of them proceeded to go home on board a Kawasaki-100 motorcycle.
[10]
 
On the
way, Lingas and his companions saw accused-appellant shoot the victim, Roberto
Sunga, in front of the San Roque II Elementary School.  The victim fell to the ground.  While the victim was sprawled on the ground
begging for mercy, accused-appellant again pointed the gun at him and pulled
the trigger, but the gun did not discharge.  When it appeared to witnesses and his companions that accused-appellant
was about to approach them, they fled from the scene.  After a while, they went back.  The victim was still there but there was blood on his chest and he was
no longer moving. The victim was later on brought to the hospital.
[11]
 
Witness
admitted that he did not know the accused-appellantâs name but he was able to
identify him because he was only about five  meters away from him when the incident happened.
[12]


SPO2 Federico
Reguyal, who was assigned to the alert team of the San Jose Police on the night
of the incident, testified that in the evening of September 2, 1997, he
received a telephone report about a shooting incident in San Roque II.
[13]
 
Together
with his team, they boarded a PNP service vehicle and proceeded to San Roque II
Elementary School. When the  team
arrived at the  scene, they saw a parked
tricycle and a dead man sprawled on the ground. They found the dead manâs
driverâs license identifying him to be Roberto Sunga.
[14]
 
The body
was brought to the hospital.  On the
same night, SPO2 Reguyal returned to the crime scene where he recovered an
empty .45 caliber shell, about three meters away from where the victim was
found and  two meters away from the
house of accused-appellant.  He marked
this empty shell and turned it over to the desk sergeant of the San Jose
Police.
[15]


Dr. Nuela
Manzanida, the doctor who conducted the physical examination of the body of the
victim, testified that her post-mortem findings disclosed the following:


Wound
of entrance
 - 6 cm. in size, oval
with abrasion collar, (regular) and injury at the right anterior chest.


Exact
location
 - 3.5 inches from end of
mamubrium going to the right end  1 inch
from perpendicular line drawn from right  nipple upward, going to the left.


Wound
of exit
 - 7 cm in size, irregular
located at spinal vertebre (thorasic) at the level of inferior angle of right
scapular area.


Cause
of death
 - Cardio respiratory
arrest, secondary to hypovolemic shock, secondary to gunshot wound.
[16]


Dr. Manzanida opined that the gunshot wound was more or less caused by a
.45 caliber gun and that based on its location, the assailant was at the right
side of the victim when the gun was fired.
[17]


Rodrigo
Quirante, also testifying for the prosecution, recounted that around two
oâclock in the afternoon of September 2, 1997, he saw accused-appellant in a
drinking spree in front of his (witness) house. Accused-appellant asked him to
join them.
[18]
 
While they
were drinking, he noticed that accused-appellant kept on drawing a .45 caliber
gun tucked on his waist.
[19]
 
Around
five p.m., Quirante excused himself and went home. The following day, he found
an empty .45 caliber shell in front of his house. He was told by his wife and
children that before accused-appellant left the premises the day before, he
fired his gun several times. He gave the empty shell to Fiscal Levitico
Salcedo.
[20]


SPO4 Rolando
Ungria, Firearms and Explosives Officer, Philippine National Police, San Jose,
Occidental Mindoro,  testified that
based on the records of the PNP Provincial Headquarters in Mindoro,
accused-appellantâs name was not included in their list of holders of licensed
firearms.
[21]


Finally, the
wife of the victim,  Josephine Sunga, stated
on oath that her husband was employed as a security guard at the National Food
Authority and was earning P2,200.00 a month.
[22]
 
When he
was not on duty, he worked as a tricycle driver earning around P100.00 a day.
She and the victim had two children, aged 12 and 14.
[23]
 
Witness
also testified that they incurred P20,000.00 in connection with the death and
burial of her husband and these expenses were duly supported by receipts.
[24]


On the other
hand, the defense presented two witnesses: Rommel Acosta and accused-appellant
himself.


Rommel Acosta,
neighbor of accused-appellant, testified that around 6:30 in the evening of
September 2, 1997,  he was resting in
front of his house when a tricycle arrived bearing accused-appellant.
[25]
 
The
driver, whom he later learned to be the victim Roberto Sunga, called out to him
asking him if he knew the passenger. He answered that it was âKuya Orlie.â  The victim told him that they came from
Caminawit. When he saw that accused-appellant was drunk,  Acosta helped him alight from the tricycle.
[26]
 
Upon
reaching the door of accused-appellantâs house, the victim told him that
accused-appellant had not yet paid the ten-peso fare. When Acosta asked
accused-appellant for the fare, the latter gave him his wallet which contained
only three pesos. Accused-appellant then asked the victim if he could pay the
fare the next day.
[27]
 
At this
point, the victim  got angry and
remarked 
âIyon ang sinasabi ko sa mga lasing eh, sasakay-sakay, wala namang
pamasahe, hindi nagtatago ng pamasahe...Maaari ba namang utangin sa driver ang
pamasahe? Putang ina niya, sasakay-sakay wala namang pera
,
â
 at the
same time kicking his tricycle.
[28]
 
While the
victim was uttering these words, Acosta turned his back and left. After about
five steps, he heard a gunshot. When he turned around, he saw the victim
already sprawled on the ground.
[29]


On his part,
accused-appellant Orlando Javier declared on the witness stand that he was a
retired NAPOLCOM employee and an LLB graduate. After his retirement in 1997, he
stayed at San Roque II, Occidental Mindoro with his two sons, aged 13 and 15,
while his wife lived with their married children in Manila to follow up his
retirement benefits.
[30]


Around nine
oâclock in the morning of September 2, 1997, he went to Caminawit on a bicycle
to look for food (
magdelihensiya ng ulam
) because he did not have any
money.
[31]
 
When he
arrived at the place, he saw some friends in a drinking spree and joined them.
The drinking session lasted up to twelve noon.
[32]
 
When he was
already drunk, accused-appellant fired his .45 caliber gun upwards, emptying
the cartridge. Accused-appellant claimed that this gun was licensed in his name
and he had a permit to carry the same. However, he surrendered his license and
permit to a policeman in Nueva Ecija.
[33]
 
Because he
was so drunk, he dozed off  and woke up
around six oâclock in the afternoon. Assisted by a certain Reneng Reyes, he
hailed a tricycle and placed his bicycle at the back. He instructed the driver
to go to San Roque II where he lived.
[34]
 
Upon
arriving at said destination, the driver (who was later identified as the
victim Roberto Sunga) tried to collect the fare. Because he did not have  money with him, accused-appellant asked the
victim if he could pay the following day. The victim got mad and approached
Ramil Acosta, his neighbor, and asked the latter if he knew accused-appellant.
[35]
 
Acosta
tried to talk the victim into collecting the fare the following day but the
latter did not accede. Instead, the victim got angry.  He shouted and kicked (
kinalampag
) his tricycle while
accused-appellant was still on board.  Accused-appellant  was still
seated on the passengersâ side of the  tricycle when all of a sudden, the victim struck him with a stone from
behind.
[36]
 
Although
he was feeling dizzy, he jumped out of the tricycle and ran towards the
Guerrero Rice Mill. After a while, accused-appellant returned and saw the
victim standing as if  waiting for him.
[37]
 
As
accused-appellant was taking  out  his gun,  the victim suddenly fell down and looked as if he was suffering from
epilepsy. Accused-appellant then approached the victim, cocked the gun and
pulled the trigger several times but the gun did not fire.
[38]
 
Accused-appellant
then got his bike and went inside his house. While cooking the fish he brought
with him from Caminawit, his son noticed blood oozing from his head. He
instructed his son to get some cotton and treat his injury.
[39]
 
After a
while, he went back to the scene of the incident to look around (
nakipa-usyoso
).  He ate dinner, played chess with his son for
a while and then went to sleep.
[40]


The following
morning, September 3, 1997, accused-appellant was buying cigarettes from the
neighborhood store when the owner, Mr. Artienda, told him that he had a check
for P200.00 from his daughter in Manila.  He encashed the check, gave P100.00 to his son, and left for Manila to
follow up his retirement papers.
[41]
 
On
September 4, 1997, he had his head injury examined and treated at the Ospital
ng Sampaloc at G. Tuazon Street, Manila upon the advice of his co-employees at
NAPOLCOM as he might be implicated in the shooting of Robert Sunga.
[42]
 
He stayed
in Manila while waiting for his retirement papers until his arrest on February
9, 1998.
[43]


On
cross-examination, accused-appellant admitted that prior to his arrest and upon
information that a case for murder was filed against him, he gave the victimâs
wife P35,000.00 as financial assistance.
[44]


On March 2,
2000, the trial court rendered a decision finding accused-appellant guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and sentencing him as follows:


WHEREFORE, and in the light of all
the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the accused ORLANDO JAVIER
is GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF MURDER, as defined and
penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and Section 6 of
Republic Act 7659, otherwise referred to as the Death Penalty law, and is
HEREBY SENTENCED TO DEATH.


The accused is ordered to indemnify
the heirs of the victim Roberto Sunga in the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS
(P50,000.00) and to furthermore pay said heirs the amount of ONE HUNDRED
THOUSAND PESOS, (P100,000.00) as moral damages.


The Provincial Warden is hereby
directed to cause the immediate transfer of the accused from the Provincial
Jail at Magbay, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro to the New Bilibid Prison,
Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila.


SO ORDERED.
[45]


Before us,
accused-appellant now raises the following errors in his  Brief:


THE TRIAL
COURT ERRED IN NOT EXPLICITLY STATING WHAT AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE PRESENT
TO JUSTIFY THE IMPOSITION OF THE DEATH PENALTY.


ASSUMING
ARGUENDO THAT THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY, HE IS ONLY GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF
HOMICIDE.


Article 248 of
the Revised Penal Code defines the crime of murder as follows:


Any  person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246,
shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by 
reclusion
perpetua
, to death if committed with any of the following attendant
circumstances:


1.  With treachery, taking advantage of
superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the
defense, or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity;


2.  In consideration of a price, reward, or
promise;


3.  By means of inundation, fire, poison,
explosion, shipwreck, stranding of a vessel, derailment of or assault upon a
street car or locomotive, fall of an airship, by means of motor vehicles, or
with the use of any other means involving great waste and ruin;


4.  On occasion of any of the calamities
enumerated in the preceding paragraph, or of an earthquake, eruption of a
volcano, destructive cyclone, epidemic, or any other public calamity;


5.  With evident premeditation;


6.  With cruelty, by deliberately and inhumanly
augmenting the suffering of the victim, or outraging or scoffing at his person
or corpse.


These
circumstances must be specifically alleged in the information in order to
qualify the crime to murder; otherwise the killing may be considered merely as
homicide.
[46]


To justify its
finding that accused-appellant was guilty of the crime of murder, the trial
court appreciated the special qualifying circumstance of treachery.  It reasoned, thus:


The victim was not afforded the
opportunity to defend himself while the accused ensured that the crime would be
consummated with the least risk to his person. The victim had no inkling at all
that he would be shot by the accused. The victim was totally surprised by the
attack and not afforded an opportunity to raise any defense against his
attacker. Even when the victim was already sprawled on the ground and praying
for his life, the accused still poked the gun at him and squeezed the trigger
several times, however, the gun did not go off (t.s.n. July 15, 1999, p. 19).
This is indicative of treachery that qualifies the crime to murder. In fact,
the accused, while inside the tricycle sidecar, shot the unarmed  and unsuspecting  victim seated on the driver (sic) seat (t.s.n. March 20, 1998,
page 7), a circumstance indubitably showing treachery.


The guilt of the accused having
been proven beyond reasonable doubt  by
the prosecution, attended by  treachery,
he deserves nothing less than the supreme penalty of DEATH.


It is
well-settled that treachery as a qualifying circumstance should be proven fully
as the crime itself and cannot be simply deduced from presumption.
[47]
 
To
constitute treachery, two conditions must concur: (1) it must be shown that at
the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and
(2) that the offender consciously adopted the particular means, method or form
of attack employed by him.
[48]


After a careful
review of the records of the case, we find that the facts fail  to establish that treachery attended the
killing of Robert Sunga. 


Although the
fact of death, the identity of the victim and the identity of the assailant
were established, there is no proof at all how the killing of the victim was
done. Witness Sta. Maria testified that he saw accused-appellant shoot the
victim while both were on board a tricyle: 


Q
    
On
your way from the 7th Day Adventist Academy with he intention of going home the
way you just narrated, what happened, if anything happened?


A
     
Roberto
Sunga was shot, sir.


Q
    
Who
shot Roberto Sunga?


A
     
Mr.
Orlando Javier, sir.


xxx


Q
    
How
did Orlando Javier shot Roberto Sunga?


A
     
When
Orlando Javier shot Roberto Sunga, he was riding in a tricycle, sir.


xxx


Q
    
Who
was the driver of the tricycle?


A
     
Roberto
Sunga is the driver, sir.


Q
    
Where
was Roberto Sunga at the time he was shot by  Orlando Javier?


A
     
When
Roberto Sunga was shot by Orlando Javier he was at the driverâs seat. He was
the one driving the tricycle, sir.
[49]


The foregoing
testimony, however, failed to detail how the aggression started or how the
victim was killed.  It must be noted that
at the time of the incident, Sta. Maria was on board a motorcycle coming from
the Adventist Church.
[50]
 
He chanced
upon the victim and accused-appellant while the latter was already in the act
of shooting the former. He  did testify
on the events immediately preceding the shooting.


The other
prosecution witnesses, Matira and Lingas, did not actually see
accused-appellant shoot the victim. Matira declared that he heard a gunshot and
when he looked in the direction where the shot came from, he saw a man already
sprawled on the ground and another man standing near him holding a gun.


Q
    
On
your way home from the 7th Day Adventist was their (sic) anything unusual that
happened?


A
     
Yes,
I heard a shot, sir.


Q
    
Where
did you hear the shot?


A
     
At
San Roque II at the house in front of the school.


Q
    
When
you heard the shot what did you notice?


A
     
I
look (sic) at the direction where the shot came from.


Q
    
What
did you find out?


A
     
I
saw somebody sprawled on the ground and I saw  somebody holding something.


Q
    
Did
you notice what was that something holding by  somebody?


A
     
A  black short gun, sir.
[51]


On the part of
Lingas, he admitted that his basis for saying that it was accused-appellant who
shot the victim was the fact that he saw the former holding a gun.
[52]
 
He did not
actually see accused-appellant fire the gun.
[53]


Q
    
Where
were you at the time you saw Obet Sunga was killed?


A
     
We
were motoring on the road.


Q
    
How
did you notice the killing of Obet Sunga?


A
     
Because
Roberto Sunga was lying down and the killer was repeatedly roaming around the
killed person and tried to fire again at the killed body of  Roberto Sunga.


Q
    
And
did the gun fire?


A
     
No
more, sir.


xxx


Q
    
What
is your basis in saying that it was the accused Orlando Javier who shot or killed
Roberto Sunga when according to you when he was tricking his gun, 
        
it did not fire?


A
     
Because
he was the one holding the gun.


Q
    
Now
before you saw this Orlando Javier pointing that gun towards Obet Sunga, did
you hear any sound  of gunshot?


A
     
None,
Sir.
[54]


Like Sta. Maria,
Matira and Lingas failed to provide the details on the particular means, method
or form of attack employed by accused-appellant that led to the victimâs death.
This is precisely because both arrived at the scene of the crime after the
victim was shot and was already sprawled on the ground.


In the case
of  
People vs. Edison Plazo
,
[55]
 
we ruled
that where no particulars are known regarding the manner in which the
aggression was made or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim
began and developed, it cannot be established from mere supposition that the
accused perpetrated the killing with treachery. Likewise in 
People vs. Oscar Oliva
,
[56]
 
we said
that absent any particulars as to the manner in which aggression was commenced
or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim unfolded, treachery
cannot be appreciated against accused-appellant.


While it may be admitted
that at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend
himself because he was driving the tricycle, there was no proof that
accused-appellant consciously or purposely adopted the mode of attack employed
by him. Indeed, accused-appellantâs attack was sudden; however, mere suddenness
of the attack is not enough to constitute treachery.
[57]
 
It must be
shown that the means of attack was consciously adopted
[58]
 and the
accused reflected on the means and made some preparation to kill the victim.
[59]


On the other
hand, there is enough evidence to show that the shooting of the victim was made
on the spur of the moment brought about by a stinging provocation from the
victim. Ramil Acosta testified that prior to the shooting, there was an
altercation between accused-appellant and victim because the former could not
pay the  ten-peso tricycle fare.


Q
    
In
the time that you mentioned, 6:30 oâclock in the evening, have you noticed
something unusual?


xxx


A
     
I
noticed that the tricycle where Orlando Javier was boarded arrived and the
tricycle driver called me.


Q
    
And
who is this tricycle driver that you said called you?


A
     
For
what I know, the surname is Sunga, Sir.


xxx


Q
    
And
what was the reason why this Robert Sunga, Jr.  called you up.


A
     
He
asked me if I know his passenger, Sir.


Q
    
Who
is the passenger that you are referring?


A
     
I
recognized that the passenger is Orlando Javier.


xxx


Q
    
What
other things tell (sic) you by Robert Sunga after knowing that his passenger is
Orlie?


A
     
He
told me that they came from Caminawit, Sir.


Q
    
And
what was your answer, if any, if you answered  him?


A
     
I
told Roberto Sunga that I will just help Kuya Orlie because he was drunk at
that time?


Q
    
After
that what happened next?


A
     
When
I assisted Kuya Orlie in alighting  the
tricycle, when we were at the door, Roberto Sunga told me that Kuya Orlie has
not yet paid.


Q
    
So,
what was your answer when Roberto Sunga told you that Orlando Javier has not
yet paid the fare?


A
     
What
I did, I asked for the fare from Kuya Orlie.


Q
    
And
what was the response of Orlando Javier?


A
     
Kuya
Orlie took his wallet and I saw that only P3.00 coins were inside his wallet.


Q
    
What
happened next when you saw  the P3.00
coins from the wallet of Orlando Javier?


A
     
I
asked the driver how much is the fare , Sir.


Q
    
And
what was the answer of Roberto Sunga, the driver?


A
     
He
told me that the fare from Caminawit to San Roque is P10.00.


Q
    
And
what was the answer of Orlando Javier or your answer?


A
     
Kuya
Orlie said that if possible, he will just pay the fare tomorrow and told to the
driver that I will be the one to collect from him.


Q
    
And
what was the response of Roberto Sunga?


A
     
Roberto
Sunga  did not agree with the
suggestion.  I told oberto  Sunga that I have no money and I will just
pay it tomorrow but this Roberto Sunga did not agree and he got angry, Sir.


Q
    
And
what was the reaction of Roberto Sunga when you said that he got angry because
of the answer given by you and the accused Orlando Javier?


A
     
He
told me that âiyon ang sinasabi ko sa mga lasing eh, sasakay-sakay, wala namang
pamasahe, hindi nagtatago  ng pamasahe.â


Q
    
So,
after that what happened?


A
     
After
that Roberto Sunga uttered bad words âminura niya si Kuya Orlieâ and told him
âmaaari ba namang utangin sa driver ang pamasahe?â


Q
    
When
you said âminuraâ,  can you
remember  those words uttered by Roberto
Sunga?


A
     
âPutang
ina niya, sasakay-sakay wala namang peraâ and he was kicking his tricycle, Sir.


Q
    
After
that what happened?


A
     
When
he was getting angry and uttering bad words to Kuya Orlie, I turned my back and
left.


Q
    
When
you turned your back and left, where was Orlando Javier?


A
     
Orlando
Javier was beside the tricycle, Sir.


Q
    
What
was he doing there?


A
     
I
donât know what he was doing because after I turned my back, after five (5)
steps, I heard a gunshot, Sir.


Q
    
And
when you heard the gunshot, what things did you do, if any?


A
     
When
I heard the shots, I turned and I saw the tricycle driver lying down.
[60]


Witness Sta.
Maria himself admitted that accused-appellant and victim seemed to be
conversing prior to the shooting although he did not actually hear what they
were talking about.


Q
    
You
saw the shooting of the victim by the accused, is that correct?


A
     
Yes,
sir.


Q 
   
Before  the accused shoot (sic) the victim, was
there any conversation between the accused and the victim?


A
     
We
did not witness anymore their conversation, sir.


Q
    
I
am asking whether you heard them conversing?


A
     
We
saw them conversing but  I did not hear,
sir.
[61]


We have ruled
that provocation of the accused by the victim negates the presence of treachery
even if the attack may have been sudden and unexpected.
[62]
 
When the
assault upon the victim is preceded by a heated argument,  treachery cannot be appreciated.
[63]


The Solicitor
General claims that the trial court was justified in imposing the penalty of
death. It is argued that while the decision was indeed silent on what
aggravating circumstance merited the imposition of the death penalty upon
accused-appellant, it was nonetheless established during trial that an
unlicensed firearm was used in the killing. The Solicitor General relies on the
records of the Provincial Firearms Licensing Agency of the PNP which did not
include the name of accused-appellant in the list of licensed firearms
holders.  


The contention
is untenable.  Not having been alleged
in the Information, the use of an unlicensed cannot be appreciated against
accused-appellant.
[64]


Absent the
qualifying circumstance of treachery, the crime committed in this case is only
homicide under Art. 249 of the Revised Penal Code with the corresponding
penalty of 
reclusion temporal
.
[65]
 
Further,
there being no aggravating nor mitigating circumstance shown, the penalty
should be fixed in its medium period.
[66]
 
Applying
the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law,
[67]
 
the
maximum of the penalty shall be taken from the  medium period of 
reclusion temporal
, which ranges from a minimum
of 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to a maximum of 17 years and 4 months, while
the minimum shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree which is 
prision
mayor
, in any of its periods, the range of which is 6 years and 1 day to 12
years.


The Court
affirms the award of P50,000.00 as indemnity for the death of Roberto
Sunga.  Inaddition, we  grant the award of actual damages in the
amount of P20,000.00. The Court, however, finds the award of moral damages in
the amount of P100,000.00 to be excessive. Considering that moral damages are
not intended to enrich the prevailing party,
[68]
 
the amount
of P50,000.00 would be in keeping with the purpose of the law. 


WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Regional Trial
Court of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, Branch 46, is hereby MODIFIED and
accused-appellant ORLANDO JAVIER is declared GUILTY OF HOMICIDE, and sentenced
to an indeterminate prison term of 8 years and 1 day of 
prision mayor

medium as minimum, to 17 years and 4 months of 
reclusion temporal
 medium
as maximum. Accused-appellant is ordered to indemnify the heirs of the victim
in the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages.


SO ORDERED.
