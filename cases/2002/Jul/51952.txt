BELLOSILLO, J.:


This Petition for
Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 filed by Manuel N. Tormes assails the
31 October 2000 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
CV No. 57190 affirming the 24 July 1996 Joint Decision
[2]
 of the RTC-Br. 32, Pili, Camarines
Sur, in Crim. Case No. P-1766 and Civil Case No. P-1588 insofar as it ordered
him to surrender to respondent Alfredo L. Llanes TCT No. 11349 within fifteen
(15) days from the finality of the decision to allow the latter to have his
mortgage annotated thereon before the Register of Deeds of Camarines Sur.


Salvador Motos
was the registered owner of a parcel of land located in Pili, Camarines Sur,
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 3381 (21879).  On 10 May 1984, he mortgaged the property in
favor of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), Naga, to secure an
indebtedness of 
P
23,695.25.  On
10 May 1984, respondent Alfredo L. Llanes loaned Motos an amount equivalent to
that he owed DBP, secured by a real estate mortgage over the same parcel of
land covered by TCT No. 3381, payable on or before 30 July 1984.  The loan was intended to discharge Motos
from his mortgage indebtedness to DBP, Naga, and conditioned upon respondent
Llanes' use of the land as collateral for the loan which he in turn obtained
from the Republic Planter's Bank.  It
was likewise agreed by the parties that Llanes would pay the taxes on the land
so long as he was using it as security, subject to reimbursement by Motos.  Thereafter, title over the land was
delivered to Llanes.


On 30 July 1984
the indebtedness of Motos to Llanes became due and has since remained
unpaid.  On the pretext of helping
Llanes collect the payment for the loan from Motos, Gaudioso M. Borja, a deputy
sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of Naga City, induced Llanes to part with
TCT No. 3381 and returned the same to Motos without the knowledge of Llanes.


On 21 May 1986,
upon failure of Deputy Sheriff Borja to return the title, respondent Llanes
caused the annotation of his adverse claim in the Register of Deeds.  On 26 May 1986 he filed a petition for
extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage.  On 8 September 1986 the land was foreclosed and sold at public
auction to Llanes for 
P
47,000.00.  However, the Provisional Certificate of Sale could not be registered
because the mortgage, subject of the foreclosure, was not registered.  Moreover, TCT No. RT-3381 had been cancelled
by virtue of the registration of a Deed of Absolute Sale executed by Motos in
favor of petitioner Manuel N. Tormes annotated on 21 July 1986 and replaced by
TCT No. 11349.


Aggrieved,
Llanes filed a criminal complaint for estafa against Motos
[3]
 and a separate civil case for sum
of money, damages and reconveyance against Motos, Borja and Tormes.
[4]
 These two (2) cases were
consolidated.


On 24 July 1996
the trial court rendered a joint decision in favor of respondent Alfredo L.
Llanes finding his testimony deserving of full faith and credit, and his acts -
from his complaint in the local papers to his complaint in the Supreme Court
indicative of an ordinary honest man's outrage at being conned and taken
advantage of.  The trial court was
unconvinced that Salvador Motos had already paid respondent Llanes the amount
due the latter as there was no proof of payment presented; nor did it believe
Borja's claim that he did not receive the title over the parcel of land as it
was a mere denial that pales in the face of Llanes' positive testimony.  Lastly, the trial court discredited Tormes'
claim that he was a buyer in good faith and for value since at the time that he
registered the deed of sale in his favor on 21 July 1986 he already had notice
of the adverse claim of Llanes which had been duly annotated as of 21 May 1986.


On the basis of
the evidence, the trial court in Crim. Case No. P-1766 found Motos, the accused
therein, guilty of swindling and sentenced him to suffer imprisonment of two
(2) months of 
arresto mayor
, and to pay a fine of 
P
2,000.00 for
the reasonable value of the deprivation of the possession of the title over the
subject parcel of land and the damage incurred by Llanes by reason of Motos'
failure to produce the title for registration.  In Civil Case No. 1588, the trial court ordered Motos, defendant
therein, to pay Llanes the sum of 
P
23,695.25 plus liquidated damages of 
P
3,500.00
for attorney's fees with interest at the legal rate from 31 May 1986 until
fully paid.  His co-defendant Manuel N.
Tormes was ordered to surrender TCT No. 11349 to Llanes within fifteen (15)
days from the finality of the decision for the purpose of having the mortgage
annotated in the Registry of Deeds of Camarines Sur.  Lastly, both defendants Motos and Borja were ordered to
solidarily pay Llanes the sum of  
P
20,000.00
as moral damages.


The defendants
separately appealed, with Motos and Borja jointly raising the issue of Llanes'
credibility and Tormes assailing the court
 a
 
quo
's finding of bad
faith on his part and its consequent order for him to surrender to Llanes TCT
No. 11349 for the purpose of having the mortgage annotated in the Registry of
Deeds.


On 31 October
2000 the Court of Appeals found the appeals of Motos and Borja to be
unmeritorious and affirmed the ruling of the trial court.  Insofar as Tormes was concerned, it affirmed
that he was not a buyer in good faith as there was an adverse claim annotated
at the back of the title at the time he had the sale registered thereon and
held that since Tormes bought the property during the pendency of a case which
was subsequently decided against the seller, he merely became a
successor-in-interest of the seller, hence, bound by the court's final judgment
thereon.


On 29 November
2000 a motion for reconsideration was filed by Tormes on his own behalf but his
motion was denied by the appellate court on 27 July 2000.


Petitioner
Tormes now argues that the appellate court erred in affirming the trial
court.  He claims that when he caused
the annotation of the deed of sale in his favor on 21 July 1986 the adverse
claim filed by Llanes had already been cancelled in view of the petition to
cancel the same which Llanes filed on 10 July 1986.  As such, the title was already clear from any prior right or
vested claim that any party may have on it at the time of his purchase of the
land.  He further asserts that there is
no purpose to be served by his surrendering TCT No. 11349 to Llanes since the
annotation of the mortgage had already been mooted by the order of the trial
court itself to Motos to pay his obligation to Llanes.  Moreover, petitioner points out that the
finding of the appellate court that Motos bought the property pending
litigation is misleading as the complaint by Llanes against Motos was filed
only on 7 November 1986 while the Deed of Sale in his favor (petitioner) was
executed on 25 March 1986 and registered on 21 July 1986.  Thus when the complaint was filed by
respondent Llanes against Motos including petitioner as co-defendant, the
latter already had a vested right over the property having registered the same
in good faith.  Lastly, he argues that
the alleged prior mortgage of the land in favor of respondent must not affect
his rights as buyer thereof as he had not taken part therein.


We find no merit
in the petition; hence, it is 
DENIED
.  It raises no substantial issue different from those already resolved in
the court below.  The principal issue of
whether petitioner was a buyer in good faith is a question that has already
been passed upon by the trial court and affirmed by the appellate court.  We see no reason to resolve it anew in the
absence of any misappreciation of the facts or any abuse of discretion.  Moreover, the same issue, especially whether
petitioner had notice of respondent's lien, is a question of fact, not law,
hence, not cognizable by this Court in a petition for review on certiorari
under Rule 45.  In asserting that at the
time of his purchase of the land and his subsequent registration of the sale
before the Register of Deeds he relied on the face of the title showing that
the adverse claim of respondent Llanes had already been cancelled, petitioner
is actually inviting us to calibrate the whole evidence anew and consider once
again the credibility of witnesses, the existence and relevancy of specific
surrounding circumstances, their relation to each other and as a whole, and the
probabilities of the situation,
[5]
 and make another factual determination
based thereon - a course of action which is clearly improper given the nature
of the instant petition.


The Court cannot
make any adjudication on the issue of cancellation of adverse claim which
petitioner contends effectively cleared the title from any encumbrance.  Whether the same had indeed been cancelled,
through whose efforts it was facilitated, and the validity of the procedure
observed in its cancellation are not within the authority of this Court to look
into since it is presumed that the courts 
a quo 
had already judiciously
examined the evidence relating thereto when they made their final determination
in this case.


Moreover,
respondent Llanes is correct when he points out that the appealed Decision of
31 October 2000 in CA-G.R. CV No. 57190 is already final and executory with
respect to the main defendant-appellants therein Salvador Motos and Gaudioso M.
Borja.  Thus, the findings of the trial
court with regard to Motos and Borja which have some bearing on the position of
Tormes, particularly the subsistence of a real estate mortgage over the land
which Motos executed in favor of Llanes to secure his indebtedness but which
subject property Motos later sold to Tormes, are likewise final which the Court
will no longer disturb.


The order of the
trial court upon Tormes to surrender the title over the land to Llanes for
annotation of the latter's mortgage is apparently based on the elementary
principle that a monetary obligation still needs to be secured by the mortgage
executed thereon pending payment or satisfaction thereof.  Thus, the order to Motos to pay his
obligation does not render moot the order to Tormes to surrender the title to
Llanes for registration purposes since the mortgage subsists pending and until
after the satisfaction of the debt, to be discharged only upon payment of the
obligation.


On 3 December
2001, respondent in his 
Urgent Addendum
 reported that petitioner Tormes
had already sold the mortgaged land to Tomas A. Palmero, Jr., a relative of his
wife.  Subsequently, on 5 March 2002,
respondent in his 
Addendum to Comment
 disclosed that as shown on the 8
February 2001 Sheriff's Report from RTC-Br. 32, Pili, Camarines Sur, the Writ
of Execution against petitioner's co-defendants remained unserved since Motos
and his wife had been out in the U.S. for more than a year and their return was
uncertain.


The Court is
alarmed by the manner by which petitioner and his co-defendant Motos were able
to evade the law and obstruct the administration of justice.  Indeed, as respondent correctly observes,
the only recourse left for him is to have the real estate mortgage annotated on
the new title of Palmero, which would deplorably entail another onslaught of
litigation.  But grave though our
indignation may be, the hands of the law are restrained, albeit temporarily, by
the physical and legal impossibility of the situation, with Motos being at the
moment out of its reach and Palmero being not a party to the instant case.  We can only empathize with respondent Llanes
for what fate has dealt him and commend him for his tenacious adherence to the
law and unwavering confidence in the legal system.


WHEREFORE
, the instant petition is
DENIED.  Consequently, the 31 October
2000 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 57190 which affirmed
the 24 July 1996 Joint Decision of the RTC-Br. 32, Pili, Camarines Sur, in
Crim. Case No. P-1588, is AFFIRMED.
