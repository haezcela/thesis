SPOUSES JESUS AND TERESITA
FRILLES, PETITIONERS, VS. SPOUSES ROBERTO AND CLARA YAMBAO AND P. T.
LEELIN REALTY & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


Clara M. Paterno
and her brother, Leonardo M. Paterno, were the registered owners of a 277-square
meter lot situated at 7414 Santillan St., Barangay Pio del Pilar, Makati City,
under Transfer Certificate of  Title
(TCT) No. 137813 of  the Registry of  Deeds, same city.


On October 15,
1974, Leonardo Paterno leased the lot to spouses Teresita and Jesus
Frilles.  In their lease contract,
[1]
 they
agreed that the period of the lease shall be fifteen (15) years, renewable at
the will of both parties, at a monthly rental of P200.00; and that the lessees
shall construct a building on the premises.


On March 17,
1983, Leonardo Paterno and his sister, Clara Paterno-Yambao,
[2]
 
sold the
same lot to P. T. Leelin Realty & Development Corporation (Leelin Realty
for brevity) for Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (
P
200,000.00).  Subsequently, the title of the property was
cancelled and TCT No. 121130 was issued in the name of Leelin Realty.  This prompted spouses Frilles to file with
the Regional Trial Court, Makati, Branch 61, on June 1, 1989 a complaint for
rescission of the deed of sale, reconveyance and damages against spouses Yambao
and Leelin Realty.
[3]
 In their
complaint, spouses Frilles alleged, among others, that (a) pursuant to the
lease contract, which would expire on December 17, 1989, they have been
diligently paying the monthly rentals and that they constructed their
residential building thereon; and that (b) the sale of the leased property to
Leelin Realty deprived them of their opportunity to exercise their preferential
right to purchase it under Presidential Decree No. 1517 (otherwise known as the
Urban Land Reform Law).


In their answer
to the complaint, spouses Yambao
[4]
 countered

inter alia
 that P.D. No. 1517 does not vest upon spouses Frilles any
preferential right to buy the lot.


Subsequently,
spouses Frilles consigned to the trial court the amount of Three Hundred
Thousand Pesos (
P
300,000.00) as proof of their financial capability to
purchase the property even at a higher price.


After the
pre-trial conference, on the basis of a motion for summary judgment
[5]
 filed by
spouses Frilles, the trial court, on June 8, 1992, rendered judgment, the
dispositive portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, premises
above-considered, a summary judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
plaintiffs and as against defendants by:


1.  Declaring plaintiffs as entitled to the preferential right to purchase
the property object of this suit under the terms and conditions to be
determined by the Urban Zone Expropriation and Land Management Committee as
provided for in Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 1517;


2.  Declaring the Deed of Sale, dated 17 March 1983, executed by Clara P.
Yambao and Leonardo M. Paterno in favor of defendant P. T. Leelin Realty &
Development Corporation as null and void;


3.  Ordering defendant P. T. Leelin Realty & Development Corporation to
convey the subject property in favor of herein plaintiffs upon receipt of the
full payment therefor as well as for real property taxes and other legal fees
in favor of the government.


âSO ORDERED.â
[6]


On July 2, 1992,
spouses Yambao and Leelin Realty interposed an appeal to the Court of Appeals,
docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 39152.


On February 28,
1997, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision, the dispositive portion of  which states:


âWHEREFORE, premises considered,
the appealed decision is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered
DISMISSING the complaint.  Costs against
the appellees.


âSO ORDERED.â


On March 21,
1997, spouses Frilles filed a motion for reconsideration but was denied.
[7]


Hence, the
instant petition for review on certiorari.


The issue in
this case is whether or not the petitioners are entitled to the right of first
refusal to purchase the subject lot under P. D. No. 1517.


Petitioners
contend that as legitimate tenants for more than ten years under the lease
contract, they have the preferential right to purchase the property, pursuant
to Section 6, P. D. No. 1517, which reads:


âSection 6.  
Land Tenancy in Urban Land Reform Areas
.  Within the Urban Zones, legitimate tenants
who have resided on the land for ten years or more, who have built their homes
on the land, and residents who have legally occupied the lands by contract,
continuously for the last ten years shall not be dispossessed of the land and
shall be allowed the right of first refusal to purchase the same within a
reasonable time and at reasonable prices, under terms and conditions to be
determined by the Urban Zone Expropriation and Land Management Committee
created by Section 8 of  this Decree.â


On the other
hand, respondents claim that P. D. No. 1517 does not apply to this case because
the lot involved is not part of the declared Areas for Priority Development and
Urban Land Reform Zones.


We agree with
the respondents.


P. D. No. 1517,
which took effect on June 11, 1978, seeks to protect the rights of bona-fide
tenants in urban lands by prohibiting their ejectment therefrom under certain
conditions, and by according them preferential right to purchase the land
occupied by them.
[8]
 
The law
covers all urban and urbanizable lands which have been proclaimed as urban land
reform zones by the President of the Philippines.
[9]
 
If a
particular property is within a declared Area for Priority Development and
Urban Land Reform Zone, the qualified lessee of the said property in that area
can avail of the right of first refusal to purchase the same in accordance with
Section 6 of the same law.
[10]
 
Only
legitimate tenants who have resided for ten years or more on specific parcels
of land situated in declared Urban Land Reform Zones or Urban Zones, and who
have built their homes thereon, have the right not to be dispossessed therefrom
and the right of first refusal to purchase the property under reasonable terms
and conditions to be determined by the appropriate government agency.
[11]


Pursuant to P.
D. No. 1517, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Proclamation No. 1893 on
September 11, 1979 declaring the entire Metropolitan Manila area as an Urban
Land Reform Zone for purposes of urban land reform.
[12]
 The
pertinent provisions of the said proclamation read:


"x x x
             
x x x
     
x x x 


âNOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E.
MARCOS, President of the Philippines, pursuant to Section 4 of Presidential
Decree No. 1517 entitled âProclaiming Urban Land Reform in the Philippines and
Providing for the Machinery Thereof,â 
do hereby declare the entire
Metropolitan Manila composed of the Cities of Manila, Quezon, Pasay and
Caloocan and the Municipalities of Valenzuela, Malabon, Navotas, Marikina, San
Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, Pasig, Pateros, Taguig, Paranaque, Las PiÃ±as and
Muntinlupa as an Urban Land Reform Zone.


"Accordingly, as Section 4 of
Presidential Decree No. 1517 provides, âNo urban land can be disposed of or
used or constructed on unless its disposition or use conforms with the
development and zoning plans of the Ministry (of Human Settlements), and the
approved enforcement and implementation guidelines in accordance with the
Official Development Registry System and the Development Use Permit System
provided for in Sections 13 and 16 of this Decree.â


"In consonance with the above,
all landowners in Metro Manila are required under Sections 4, 9, 12 and 15 of
said Decree to register their existing rights, development proposals, proposed
improvements, and proposals to sell, lease or encumber lands with the Human
Settlements Regulatory Commission.â


âx x x
             
x x x
     
x x x
"  (Emphasis ours)


Thereafter, or
on May 14, 1980, Proclamation No. 1967 was issued, amending Proclamation No.
1893 and identifying 244 sites in Metropolitan Manila as Areas for Priority
Development and Urban Land Reform Zones, thus:


"x x x
             
x x x
     
x x x 


âNOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E.
MARCOS, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by
the Constitution and existing laws, and in relation to Proclamation No. 1893
declaring the entire Metropolitan Manila area as an Urban Land Reform Zone, and
LOI 935, 
hereby amend Proclamation No. 1893 by declaring 244 sites in
Metropolitan Manila as Areas for Priority Development and Urban Land Reform
Zones
 as described in the attached annex.


âThe provisions of PD Nos. 1517,

1640 and 1642 and of LOI No. 935 
shall
apply only to the above-mentioned Areas for Priority Development and Urban Land
Reform Zones. 


âx x x
             
x x x
     
x x
x" (Emphasis ours)


Petitioners
argue that Proclamation No. 1967 merely specifies the 244 sites of Areas of
Priority Development and Urban Land Reform Zones within the Metropolitan
Manila, but does not repeal Proclamation No. 1893 declaring the entire Metropolitan
Manila as an Urban Land Reform Zone.  Thus, they insist in exercising their right of first refusal because the
lot is located within the Urban Land Reform Zone.


It is undisputed
that Proclamation No. 1893 declares the entire Metropolitan Manila as an Urban
Land Reform Zone.  However, Proclamation
No. 1967 subsequently issued expresses a clear intent to limit the operation of
P. D. No. 1517 
to specific areas declared to be both an Area for Priority
Development and an Urban Land Reform Zone, insofar as Metropolitan  Manila is concerned,
[13]
 thus:


"WHEREAS, 
it is now
necessary and appropriate to identify specific sites covered by urban land
reform in Metropolitan Manila, for purposes of making specific the
applicability of P. D. Nos. 1517,
 1640 and 1642 and of LOI No. 935."
(Emphasis ours)


In fact,
Proclamation No. 1967 explicitly states that 
  "[t]he provisions of P.D. Nos. 1517, 
1640 and 1642 and of
LOI No. 935 
shall apply only to the above-mentioned Areas for Priority
Development and Urban Land Reform Zones."


Let it be
stressed that on May 23, 1983, Proclamation No. 2284 was issued specifying an
additional site within Metropolitan Manila as part of the Area for Priority
Development and Urban Land Reform Zone.
[14]

Proclamation Nos. 1967 and 2284 which succeeded Proclamation No. 1893 narrowed
the coverage of  P. D. No. 1517 in the
Metropolitan Manila area from the entire metropolis to the specifically
declared 
Areas for Priority Development and Urban Land Reform Zones.


Thus, a
legitimate tenant's right of first refusal to purchase the leased property
under P. D. No. 1517 depends on whether the disputed property in Metropolitan
Manila is situated in an area specifically declared to be 
both
 an Area
for Priority Development 
and 
Urban Land Reform Zone.


In the case at
bar, the determination of whether the lot in question is located within an Area
for Priority Development and Urban Land Reform Zone will entail a review of
factual evidence, proscribed in a petition for review before this Court.
[15]
 
However,
considering that the trial court and the Court of Appeals have contradictory
rulings on this factual issue, we are constrained to review the evidence and
resolve this conflict.
 
[16]


The trial court
found that the subject lot on Santillan St., Makati City is part of the Urban
Land Reform Zones, pursuant to Proclamation No. 1893.  On the other hand, the Court of Appeals held that the said
property is outside the Areas for Priority Development and Urban Land Reform
Zones.


The Court of
Appeals is correct.  The sites declared
as the Areas for Priority Development and Urban Land Reform Zones in Makati
City comprise the following:


1. Guadalupe Nuevo - A rectangular shaped area
bounded by Dapitan Street on the northwest adjacent to the Fort Bonifacio
Boundary on the east, Visayas Street on the southeast and on the southwest.


2. Primo de Rivera-Lapaz Bo. Sta. Cruz
     
 - An area bounded on the north by Davila,
on the west by Florida Street, on the east by Primo de Rivera Street and on the
south by Onyx, Guam and Mola Streets.


3. Tejeros Garden and H. Santos - A triangular shaped
area bounded by Aguilar Street on the northeast, J. P. Rizal Street on the
south, H. Santos Street on the northwest.


4. Barangay Pitogo - An irregular shaped area
consisting of five blocks starting from the corner of EDSA and Honda Street,
extending southeast, Harvard Street on the south, Guingua on the southeast,
Pinagkaisahan Creek on the northeast and Aguitaya Street on the northwest.


5. Zanzibar & Borneo Sts., Barangay San Isidro -
A rectangular shaped area bounded by Uruguay Street on the north, Arthur Street
on the east, Harrison Street on the south and Batangas Street on the west.


6. Quirinal St. & Puerto Rico Street - A
rectangular shaped area bounded by Arellano Street on the north, Olivares St.
on the east, Harrison Street on the south and Batangas Street on the west.


7. Zobel Street, Bgy. Valenzuela - A rectangular
shaped area bounded by Pasig River on the northeast, E. Zobel Street on the
southeast, S. OsmeÃ±a St. on the northwest.


8. Bgy. Olimpia - An area along Pasig Line infront of
Manila South Cemetery starting from South Avenue on the northeast up to Pililla
Street on the east, covering San Fernando Street, Sacramento Street, Jacinto
Street, J. B. Roxas Street, San Bernardino Street, Legaspi Street, D. Oliman
Street, Iriga Street and Baler Street.


9. Pasong Tirad - An irregular shaped area bounded by
J. P. Rizal Street on the northeast, Pasong Tamo on the north, Imelda St. on
the southeast, Pasong Tirad on the southeast, Solchichuga Street on southwest
and Manila-Makati Boundary on the northwest.


10. San Antonio, Lambayao - A rectangular shaped area
bounded by Sampaloc Street on the northwest, Lambayao Street on the northeast,
St. Paul on the southeast and Mayapis Street on the southwest."
[17]


What is thus
clear is that the foregoing list does not include Santillan Street or any part
of Barangay Pio del Pilar, Makati City where the property in controversy is
located.  Consequently, petitioners can
not avail of a prior right under P. D. No. 1517 to purchase the same.


WHEREFORE
, the petition is DENIED.  The assailed Decision of the Court of
Appeals dated February 28, 1997 in CA-G.R. CV No. 39152 is AFFIRMED.


SO ORDERED.
