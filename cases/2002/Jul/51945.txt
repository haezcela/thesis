EULOGIO MORALES, ROSALIA MORALES AND WILMA HALLARE, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


The drive to rid
the government of graft and corruption deserves the support of everyone.  Vulgar circumventions of the Anti-Graft Law
cannot be countenanced by this Court.


The
Case


Before us is a Petition
for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking the reversal of the May
15, 2000 Decision
[1]
 
and the
July 17, 2000 Resolution
[2]
 of the
Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 17524.  The challenged Decision disposed as follows:


âWHEREFORE, judgment is hereby
rendered in this case finding accused Eulogio E. Morales, Wilma Hallare and
Rosalia Morales GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime for Violation of
Sec. 3, par. (g) in relation to par. (h) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended,
and after applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law sentences each of them to
suffer an imprisonment of six (6) years, as minimum, to eight (8) years, as
maximum with perpetual disqualification from public office, and to pay the
costs of the suit.

[3]


Petitioners
Eulogio Morales, Rosalia Morales and Wilma Hallare
[4]
 were
charged with violation of Section 3, paragraph (g) in relation to paragraph (h)
of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (RA 3019, as amended).  The offense was allegedly committed as follows:


âThat on or about August 20, 1986,
or imemediately [sic] prior thereto, in Olongapo City and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Eulogio Morales, a public
officer, being then the duly appointed General Manager of the Olongapo City
Water District, a government agency, conspiring and confederating with accused
Wilma Hallare, Finance Officer of the said water district and the formerâs wife
Rosalia Morales, did then and there, wilfully and unlawfully sell, transfer and
convey a 1979 Model Gallant car Sigma with Motor No. 2M-08206, with an assessed
value of 
P
75,000.00 on behalf of the Olongapo City Water District, to
[Petitioner] Wilma Hallare for only 
P
4,000.00, which amount is
manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the Olongapo City Water District and
on even date, accused Wilma Hallare again sell, transfer and convey the same
vehicle to accused Rosalia Morales, thus showing accused Eulogio Morales and
Wilma Hallare having become directly and/or indirectly pecuniarily interested in
the said transaction, wherein they intervened in their official capacities as
General Manager and Finance Officer, respectively of the Olongapo City Water
District.â
[5]


Upon their
arraignment on March 5, 1992, petitioners, assisted by their counsel 
de
oficio,
[6]
 pleaded
not guilty.
[7]
 
During the
pretrial, the following were stipulated:


â1.
            
That on August 20, 1986, at the time
of the sale of the subject Galant Sigma automobile, [Petitioner] Eulogio
Morales was the [g]eneral [m]anager of the Olongapo City Water District;


â2.
            
That on August 20, 1986 and prior
thereto the Olongapo City Water District was the registered owner of the
subject 1979 model Galant Sigma with Motor No. 211-08-206;


â3.
            
That on August 20, 1986 [Petitioner]
Wilma Hallare was the [f]inance [o]fficer of the Olongapo City Water District;


â4.
            
That [Petitioner] Rosalia Morales is
the wife of [Petitioner] Eulogio Morales;


â5.
            
That one of the issues in this case
is whether or not the Olongapo City Water District is a government owned and
controlled corporation.â
[8]


After the
prosecution formally offered its evidence, petitioners filed, with leave of
court, a Joint Demurrer to Evidence
[9]
 
on the
grounds of lack of jurisdiction and failure to prove the guilt of the
accused.  They argued that they were not
public officers, because the Olongapo City Water District was not covered by
the Civil Service Law.  In its July 20,
1993 Resolution,
[10]
 
the
Sandiganbayan denied their Motion for lack of merit and ordered them to present
evidence in their defense.


After full trial,
the Sandiganbayan convicted petitioners in its August 28, 1997 Decision,
[11]
 
which
disposed as follows:


âWHEREFORE, in view of the
foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered CONVICTING Eulogio E. Morales, Wilma Hallare
and Rosalia Morales for violation of Section 3, par. (g) in relation to par.
(h) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, and hereby sentences them to suffer
the indeterminate penalty of not less than six (6) years, as minimum; and not
more than eight (8) years, as maximum, and to pay the costs of suit.â
[12]


On September 12,
1997, petitioners filed a Motion for New Trial and/or Motion for
Reconsideration,
[13]
 
allegedly
because of newly discovered evidence.
[14]


However, the
anti-graft court, in its February 18, 1998 Resolution denied the Motion for
utter lack of merit.
[15]
 
Thereafter,
petitioners filed another Motion for Reconsideration, which was again denied by
the Sandiganbayan in its June 1, 1998 Resolution.
[16]
 
But in its
November 16, 1998 Resolution, it reversed itself and granted petitionersâ
second Motion for Reconsideration, set aside the July 29, 1997 Decision, and
ordered a new trial.
[17]


The
Sandiganbayan thereafter rendered the assailed Decision convicting
petitioners.  Their counsels filed two
separate Motions for Reconsideration,
[18]
 
both of
which were denied in the challenged July 26, 2000 Resolution.
[19]


The Facts


Version of the Prosecution


In the assailed
Decision, the Sandiganbayan narrated the events that led to the filing of this
case:


âx x x [S]ometime on August 20,
1986, accused Eulogio E. Morales, in his capacity as [g]eneral [m]anager of
OCWD sold a Car Sigma 1979 Model with Motor No. 2M-08206, Chassis No. A-121
UL3695 and Plate No. CAV 962 owned by OCWD in favor of Wilma Hallare, the
[f]inance [o]fficer of OCWD for and in consideration of the amount of 
P
4,000.00.  Allegedly, the sale was without a board
resolution authorizing the sale.


âThe prosecution claimed that the
galant car was in good running condition, the car-air conditioning unit was
functioning with a car stereo and tape desk and had a net book value of 
P
16,105.00.


âThe buyer Wilma Hallare on the
same date, August 20, 1986 sold this galant car to Rosalia Morales, the wife of
[Petitioner] General Manager Eulogio Morales.  Thereafter, the car registration was transferred in the name of Rosalia
Morales.


âFrom July 13 to August 7, 1987, an
audit examination was conducted by the Local Utilities Water Administration
(LUWA) on the finances of OCWD by the audit team consisting of Ricardo C.
Quiras and Rosendo Ramirez who made the following findings relative to galant
car subject matter hereof, to wit:


âThe sale of a 1979 service car to
a OCWD officer at a price of only 
P
4,000.00 was found to be irregular
and therefore questionable for the reasons as follows:


âa.
           
The asset was sold at
a relatively low price to the disadvantage of the [w]ater [d]istrict.  Not only is the selling price too low
compared with prevailing prices for not particular make and model, it is even
below the net book value of the car at the time of sale.


âb.
           
No attempts were made
to obtain better prices in a formal auction sale.  The supporting bids, all of which are dated ten (10) months prior
to the date of sale (and do not indicate the particulars of the bidded item)
were submitted by individuals considered to be too close to the [w]ater
[d]istrict among them the GM of Subic [w]ater [d]istrict, the OCWD [f]inance
[o]fficer (who later became the buyer), and the proprietors of two (2) of the
districtâs regular suppliers.


âc.
           
The dilapidated
condition or sorry state of the service car which the four (4) buyers depicted
in their bids may not be given credence in view of the lack of absence of a
formal attestation from a credible body within the [w]ater [d]istrict e.g. [b]oard
[r]esolution declaring the item as unserviceable and therefore disposable, or a
formal assessment or evaluation by an independent committee.


âd.
           
No extraordinary loss
was recognized by the [w]ater [d]istrict upon the consummation of the
sale.  This notwithstanding the fact
that the subject item was sold at a price lower than the next book value.


âe.
           
The existence of two
(2) Deeds of Absolute Sale covering the transfer of ownership of the subject
item from one party to another-one, between OCWD and the winning bidder
([f]inance [o]fficer) and the other, between the latter and the [g]eneral
[m]anagerâs wife â gave us the information that such a sale is a simulated
one.  Executed on the same date, the
legal documents (copies of which are attached hereto as Annexes âOâ and âPâ)
prove one thing â that the interested party is no less than the [d]istrict
[g]eneral [m]anager.â


âThis transaction came to the
knowledge of Noli T. Zapanta, the [m]anager of the Sales Department sometime in
June 1989 when the same was referred to his office.  After finding that the sale of the galant car was done in
violation of Board Resolution No. 03-86, prohibiting all employees of the water
district  and their relatives from
engaging in business, directly or indirectly, in and with the OCWD, and since
there was no board resolution authorizing the sale of the galant car, he filed
a complaint before the Fiscalâs Office of Olongapo City against Eulogio
Morales, Rosalia Morales and Wilma Hallare.â
[20]


Version
of the Defense


Petitioners present
their version of the facts of the case in this wise:


â6.
     
That
there was a bidding conducted for the disposition of the subject motor vehicle
which was already a junked car and totally dilapidated when the winning bidder,
[Petitioner] Wilma Hallare, bought it with the intention of dismantling it and
to repair the available parts to be sold on profit.


â7.
     
That
[Petitioner] Hallare submitted her bid way back in October, 1985 and came to
know in December, 1985 that her offer of 
P
4,000.00 for the junk car was
the highest bid. 


â8.
     
That
b[e]cause [Petitioner] Hallare had only 
P
3,000.00 at that time, he asked
[Petitioner] Eulogio Morales, [g]eneral [m]anager of the Olongapo City Water
District, to pay 
P
3,000.00 first and the balance to be paid the
following month thru salary deduction, to which [Petitioner] Morales agreed.


â9.
     
That
[Petitioner] Hallare was able to fully pay her bid price of 
P
4,000.00 on
December 10, 1985 as evidenced by Cash Receipt No. 11148 dated December 10,
1985 of the Olongapo City Water District.


â10.
   
That while the sale was, in effect, consummated on December 10,
1985, however, [Petitioner] Hallare did not ask for the immediate execution of
the corresponding deed of sale nor was the Certificate of Registration covering
the car given to her as she was not in need of said documents because her
intention was to dismantle the car and sell the usable parts thereof.  Besides, the practice of the Olongapo City
Water District was not to execute a deed of sale on junk materials it sold.


â11.
   
That [Petitioner] Hallare then pulled out the junk car from the
junkyard of the OCWD and brought it to the repair shop.  She spent 
P
2,000.00 to 
P
3,000.00
more but the car remained unserviceable because of other defects of the car
that needed repair which would entail additional expenses.  So she temporarily stopped the repair of the
car until 5 to 6 months l[a]ter when she confided to [Petitioner] Rosalia
Morales about her financial problem and her desire to borrow 
P
4,000.00
from the latter.


âMrs. Morales agreed to lend her 
P
4,000.00
provided it should be paid on or before August 15, 1986.  At that time, [Petitioner] Hallare had a
prospective buyer of the car, she went to [Petitioner] Eulogio Morales to ask
for the deed of sale because she intended to sell the car.


âUpon advice of [Petitioner]
Eulogio Morales, [Petitioner] Hallare caused the preparation of the deed of
sale in her favor and presented it to [Petitioner] Eulogio Morales for
signature on August 20, 1986.  However,
her prospective buyer backed out and because her debt of 
P
4,000.00 to
Mrs. Morales remained unpaid since August 15, 1986, she told Mrs. Morales
âMaâam sa iyo na yung kotse.â  So she
caused the preparation of another deed of sale of the car in favor of Mrs.
Morales; however, Mrs. Morales did not accept the deed of sale and told
[Petitioner] Hallare just to keep it and pay her debt later on as soon as she
had a new buyer.  Hence, [Petitioner]
Hallare kept the two (2) deeds of sale inside her desk.


â13.
   
That [Petitioner] Hallare was the [f]inance [o]fficer of OCWD in
October, 1985 and she knew for a fact that their Office had a policy then that
employees were allowed to buy junk materials or equipments of the OCWD provided
the same was ready for disposal.  At the
time, the car subject of this case was already a part of the various junk
materials of OCWD.


âHowever, the said policy was
stopped sometime on January 17, 1986 because a Board Resolution was passed
prohibiting the employees from enga[g]ing in any business directly with the
OCWD.  


â14.
   
[Petitioner] Wilma Hallare submitted her bid for the subject car
and paid the first partial payment before the passage of Resolution No. 03-86
prohibiting all employees of the water district and their relatives from
engaging in business, directly or indirectly in and with OCWD.


â15.
   
Even if there was no express authority granted to [Petitioner]
Eulogio Morales to dispose of any asset of the OCWD, he had the authority to
dispose vehicles and equipments in its junkyard which were already unusable and
unserviceable.â
[21]
 (Citations omitted)


Ruling
of the Sandiganbayan


In its August
28, 1997 Decision, the Sandiganbayan ruled that jurisdiction over the subject
matter in criminal cases was properly determined by the law in effect at the
time of the commencement of the action.  
Davao City Water District v. Civil Service Commission
[22]
 
--
 
the
governing jurisprudence when the Information against them was filed on February
18, 1992 -- had classified water districts as corporations created pursuant to a
special law (PD 198, as amended), and their officials and employees as public
officers covered by the Civil Service Law.


The
Sandiganbayan also held that the sale of the subject car for 
P
4,000 was
grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government because, at the time
of sale, its book value was 
P
16,088.  Petitioners Eulogio Morales and Wilma Hallare intervened in their
official capacity in the transaction as OCWD general manager and finance
officer, respectively.  The pecuniary
interest of Eulogio Morales in the vehicle became evident when his wife,
Petitioner Rosalia Morales, bought the car from Hallare.


Despite the
reception of additional evidence for petitioners, the Sandiganbayan again
convicted them in its May 15, 2000 Decision.  Whether the Deeds of Sale evidencing the transfer of the car were made
on the same date or on different dates was inconsequential.  In all these transactions, the intended
beneficiaries were the Morales spouses.  The Deeds were executed during the effectivity of Resolution No. 03-86
dated January 17, 1986, prohibiting employees of OCWD and their relatives from
directly or indirectly engaging in business with OCWD.


The introduction
of the two Deeds of Sale dated October 6, 1986
[23]
 
and December 9, 1987,
[24]
 
aside from
the two other Deeds both dated August 20, 1986, only highlighted the
irregularity of the sale and petitionersâ propensity to lie.  The anti-graft court also ruled that
Eulogioâs claim of lack of knowledge of the sale of the car to his wife was
unbelievable.


Hence, this
Petition.
[25]


Issues


In their
Memorandum,
[26]
 
petitioners
submit the following assignment of errors:


âI.
       
With
due respect, the Honorable Sandiganbayan reversibly erred in holding that the
Olongapo City Water District was a public corporation or government-owned or
controlled corporation whose employees are covered by the Civil Service Law
and, therefore, under the jurisdiction of said court, when the truth is that
said water district was a private corporation and therefore its employees are
private not subject to the jurisdiction of said court, on the date the alleged
offense was committed by the petitioners.


âII.
      
With due respect, the conviction of the petitioners is contrary
to the provisions of the Constitution which prohibits ex post facto laws and
which guarantees equal protection of the laws.


âIII.
     
With due respect, the acts purportedly constituting the crime
charged are not actually criminal or felonious, hence no violation of Section 3
par. (g) in relation to par. (h) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, has been
committed by the petitioners.â
[27]


This
Courtâs Ruling


The Petition has
no merit.


First Issue:


Jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan


Petitioners
claim that the Sandiganbayan had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of
their case, because on August 20, 1986 -- the date when the alleged crime was
committed -- the prevailing ruling was 
Metro Iloilo Water District v.
National Labor Relations Commission.
[28]
 
The Court
had ruled therein that water districts were private corporations, and that
their employees were not subject to the Civil Service Law.  Hence, petitioners concluded that the
anti-graft court had no jurisdiction over the crime allegedly committed by
them.


We
disagree.  A review of relevant
jurisprudence reveals the infirmity of their contention.  
Baguio Water District v. Trajano,
[29]
 
promulgated
on February 20, 1984, ruled that employees and officers of water districts were
covered by the Civil Service Law.  This
ruling was echoed in 
Tanjay Water District v. Gabaton.
[30]
 
The ruling
in 
Baguio Water 
was reversed in 
Metro Iloilo Water District v. NLRC.
[31]
 
In 1991,
however, the Court -- in 
Davao City Water District v. Civil Service
Commission
[32]
 
--
returned to the ruling in 
Baguio Water.


Petitioners are
clearly mistaken in their claim, because the prevailing jurisprudence when the
crime was committed in 1986 was 
Baguio Water
, not the 
Metro Iloilo
Water 
which was promulgated in 1990.


Petitioners
argue that 
Metro Iloilo 
should be applied, not 
Davao City Water,

because the jurisdiction of a court in criminal cases should be determined by
the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime charged.  


We now rule on
this contention.  Criminal laws should
always be given prospective application; otherwise, they become 
ex post
facto.  
This is basic.  An 
ex post facto 
law has been defined
as one -- 


â(1) which makes an action done
[criminal] before the passing of the law and which was innocent when done x x x
and punishes such action; or 


â(2) which aggravates a crime or
makes it greater than when it was committed; or 


â(3) which changes the punishment
and inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when it was
committed; or 


â(4) which alters the legal rules
of evidence and receives less or different testimony than the law required at
the time of the commission of the offense in order to convict the defendant.â
[33]


The Anti-Graft
and Corrupt Practices Law was passed on August 17, 1960.
[34]
 
Hence, it
cannot be seriously contended that petitioners were accused of a crime that was
not punishable at the time it was committed.


Metro Iloilo
Water 
would have
been applicable to petitioners in accordance with the rule allowing
retroactivity of laws favorable to the accused.  But this ruling was subsequently abandoned in 
Davao City Water

in which the Court, invoking 
Baguio Water
, held that water districts
were government-controlled corporations, and their employees were covered by
the Civil Service Law.  The clear import
of that reversion was to place employees of water districts under the
Anti-Graft Law and thus within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.


Davao City
Water 
holds that
water districts fall under the general term 
government-owned or -controlled
corporations with original charters 
or those created by a special law and
not by the Corporation Code; hence, they are covered by the Civil Service
Law.  


Presidential
Decree No. 198 is a special law applicable only to the different water
districts created pursuant thereto.  While it is true that a resolution of a local 
sanggunian
 is necessary
for the final creation of a district, PD 198 is the very law that gives a water
district juridical personality.
[35]
 
Being an
original charter, it defines the primary purpose
[36]
 
and the
basic organizational setup of a water district.
[37]
 
Further,
Section 25 of this law, which exempts employees of water districts from the
Civil Service Law, was repealed by PD No. 1479, which took effect on June 11,
1978.
[38]


Besides,
petitioners do not really pose a novel question.  It is well-settled that the jurisdiction of a court to try a
criminal case is to be determined by the law in force at the time of the
institution of the action, not at the time of the commission of the crime.
[39]
 
The
Information in the instant case was filed in 1992 when 
Davao City Water 
was
the prevailing ruling.


Similarly
well-settled is the rule that the Sandiganbayan exercises exclusive original
jurisdiction in all cases involving âviolations of Republic Act No. 3019, as
amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act x x x.â
[40]
 
In case
private individuals are charged as co-principals, accomplices or accessories --
together with public officers or employees, including those employed in
government-owned or -controlled corporations -- they shall be tried jointly
with those public officers and employees.
[41]


Second Issue:


Equal Application of the Law


Petitioners
contend that they are entitled to an acquittal, because the Sandiganbayan threw
out a similar case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.  They cite the September 26, 1997 Resolution
in 
People v. Lizaso, 
Criminal Case 23506, in which the Sandiganbayan
held:


âIn its comment, the prosecution
has conceded the [c]ourtâs lack of jurisdiction in this case by reason of the
Metro Iloilo Water District ruling 
notwithstanding its subsequent
abandonment a year later in Davao City Water District vs. Civil Service
Commission, 201 SCRA 593 (1991)
.  It
has further noted that a courtâs jurisdiction over a particular offense is
determined by the time of its alleged commission.  Hence, although the prevailing ruling as of September 27, 1991 is
that employment or appointment in a water district corporation x x x is
considered public and not private and therefore covered by Civil Service Law
yet the same cannot [be] held x x x applicable in this case because the alleged
crime occurred last February 14, 1991, or seven (7) months before the said
doctrineâs promulgation.  x x x.â
[42]
 
(Underscoring in the original)


We are not
persuaded.  The quoted Resolution
provides the distinction between that case and the one at bar.  
Lizaso 
concerned acts committed
during the effectivity of the 
Metro Iloilo Water 
ruling.  The case at bar, however, concerns acts
committed during the effectivity of the 
Baguio Water District 
ruling.


Third Issue:


Sufficiency of Evidence


Petitioners
contend that their conviction under Section 3(g) of the Anti-Graft Law was
erroneous, because the sale price had not been grossly or manifestly
disadvantageous to the government.  They
aver that the subject car was already junk and was no longer in good running
condition.


Sale Grossly Disadvantageous


We
disagree.  The elements of the crime of
violating Section 3(g) of RA No. 3019, as amended, are as follows: (1) the
offender is a public officer, (2) who enters into a contract or transaction on
behalf of the government, and (3) the contract or transaction is grossly and
manifestly disadvantageous to the government.
[43]
 
Manifest 
means
âobvious to the understanding, evident to the mind x x x and is synonymous with
open, clear, visible, unmistakable, indubitable, evident and self-evident.â

Gross 
means
âflagrant, shameful, such conduct as is not to be excused.â


As earlier
discussed, Petitioners Eulogio Morales and Wilma Hallare -- being the general
manager and the finance officer, respectively, of the OCWD -- are public
officers.  Petitioner Rosalia Morales is
the wife of the general manager of OCWD and the subsequent buyer of the same
car under the second Deed of Sale.  The
subject car in this case  was sold to
Hallare by Eulogio Morales in his official capacity -- via the August 20, 1986
Deed of Sale (Exh. âCâ)
[45]
 -- for
only 
P
4,000, when its book value at the time of the sale was 
P
16.088
(Exh. âB-1â).
[46]


Petitioners tried
to persuade us that, at the time of sale, the subject car was already junk with
a net value of only 
P
3,000.  But
this contention was rebutted by Plant Account Assistant Jose Tupi, who
testified that it was still in good running condition a day before it was sold.
[47]
 
Moreover,
the Subic Water District and the Olongapo Commuter Auto Supply were also
interested in acquiring the car (Exhs. â6â and â6-aâ).
[48]
 
This fact
proves that it could not be considered as âjunk.â


The gross and
manifest disadvantage of the sale to the government is shown by the following
facts, which were stated in the Operations Audit Report:
[49]
 (1) the
subject car was sold at a very low price, well below its book value; (2) there
was no attempt to obtain a better price in a formal auction; (3) the supporting
bids were dated ten months prior to the date of sale without any indication of
the particulars of the item for bidding, and those bids were submitted by
individuals considered to be close to petitioners; (4) there was no board
resolution declaring the item as unserviceable and disposable, and neither was
a formal assessment or evaluation made by an independent body; (5) no
extraordinary loss was recognized by the water district upon the consummation
of the sale; and (5) the existence of the second Deed of Absolute Sale shows
the simulated nature of the first, while the execution of both documents on the
same date proves that the interested party was no less than the general
manager.


Besides, the
question of the actual value of the subject car at the time of sale, being
factual in nature, is best resolved by the Sandiganbayan.  Generally, factual findings of the
anti-graft court are conclusive upon the Supreme Court.
[50]
 
Since the
Sandiganbayan had pegged the value of the car at time of the sale at 
P
16,088,
the 
P
4,000 selling price quoted to Petitioner Hallare -- without bidding
or auction and without any authorizing board resolution to sell it -- was in
itself proof of the gross and manifest disadvantageousness of the sale to the
water district and, thus, to the government.


Financial
Interest 


in the Transaction


Petitioners aver
that the sale of the subject car on December 10, 1985, proven by Official
Receipt No. 11148 of same date (Exh. â5-Aâ),
[51]
 
exempts
them from criminal liability.  They
contend that OCWD Board Resolution No. 03-86, which prohibited employees from
purchasing junk materials belonging to OCWD, was passed only on January 17,
1986.


We
disagree.  We cannot fault the
Sandiganbayan for not giving any evidentiary value to the said Receipt as proof
of the date of the perfection of the sale of the car.  Such date alleged by petitioners is convincingly contradicted by
the August 20, 1986 Deed of Absolute Sale.


However,
assuming 
arguendo
 that the sale was perfected earlier than the effectivity
of Resolution 03-86, petitioners are still criminally liable, because Hallare
sold the same car to the wife of the general manager of the water district on
the same date, August 20, 1986.  This
second sale was made in violation of Section 3(h) of the Anti-Graft Law.  As aptly ruled by the Sandiganbayan, Rosalia
Morales bought the subject vehicle with her husbandâs knowledge and
consent.  In the normal course, a wife
consults her husband about purchasing a car.  Knowing that her husband was a public officer, it would be reasonable to
assume that she would consult him before buying any property that had once
belonged to the water district where he was a key official.


Petitioner
Eulogio is prohibited by the Anti-Graft Law from having direct or indirect financial
or pecuniary interest in any business, contract or transaction in which he
intervenes or takes part in his official capacity.  In 
Venus v.
Desierto
,
[52]
 
the Court
explained this prohibition as follows:


âx x x.  What is contemplated in Section 3(h) of the anti-graft law is the
actual intervention in the transaction in which one has financial or pecuniary
interest in order that liability may attach (Opinion No. 306, Series [of] 1961
and Opinion No. 94, Series [of] 1972 of the Secretary of Justice.  x x x.   For the law aims to prevent dominant use of influence, authority
and power (Deliberation on Senate Bill 293, May 6, 1959, Constitutional Record,
Vol. II, page 603).â


Eulogioâs
intervention in the transaction is proven by his signature in the August 20, 1986
Deed of Absolute Sale (Exh. âCâ) and in the October 6, 1986 Deed of Sale (Annex
âAâ to the Motion for New Trial and/or Motion for Reconsideration).
[53]
 
Not only
did he sign the Deed of Sale in representation of the OCWD as its general
manager, he also signed without authority from its board of directors.  This transaction was pursued despite
Resolution No. 03-86, dated January 17, 1986, prohibiting OCWD employees and
their relatives from engaging in transactions with the water district.
[54]
 
The
controversial sale would not have pushed through were it not for Eulogio and
Hallareâs involvement.


In view of the
foregoing, we concur with the Sandiganbayan that the scheme resorted to by
petitioners was tainted with graft and corruption.  The chain of transactions was resorted to because the general
manager of OCWD could not directly, validly and legally sell the subject car to
himself or to his wife.  Obviously, the
second sale was a vulgar circumvention of the prohibition in the Anti-Graft
Law.
