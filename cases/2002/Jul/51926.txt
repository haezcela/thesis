SOLIMAN SECURITY SERVICES,
INC. AND/OR TERESITA L. SOLIMAN, PETITIONERS, VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS
AND EDUARDO VALENZUELA, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




VITUG, J.:


Respondent
Eduardo Valenzuela, a security guard, was a regular employee of petitioner
Soliman Security Services assigned at the BPI-Family Bank, Pasay City. On 09
March 1995, he received a memorandum from petitioners relieving him from his
post at the bank, said to be upon the latterâs request, and requiring him to
report to the security agency for reassignment. The following month, or on 07
April 1995, respondent filed a complaint for illegal dismissal on the ground
that his services were terminated without a valid cause and that, during his
tenure at the bank, he was not paid his overtime pay, 13th month pay, and
premium pay for services rendered during holidays and rest days. He averred
that, after receiving the memorandum of 09 March 1995, he kept on reporting to
the office of petitioners for reassignment but, except for a brief stint in
another post lasting for no more than a week, he was put on a âfloatingâ
status.


Petitioners
contended that the relief of respondent from his post, made upon request of the
client, was merely temporary and that respondent had been offered a new post
but the latter refused to accept it. Petitioners argued that respondentâs
floating status for barely 29 days did not constitute constructive dismissal.


On 31 July 1995,
the Labor Arbiter, Ariel Cadiente Santos, arrived at a decision holding
petitioners guilty of constructive dismissal and ordering the reinstatement of
the complainant to his former position with full backwages from the date of his
âdismissalâ until his actual reinstatement; directing the Research and
Information Unit to compute the various monetary benefits awarded to the
complainant; and adjudging the payment, by way of attorneyâs fees, of ten
percent (10%) of all sums owing to the complainant.


On 16 October
1998, petitioners filed an appeal to the National Labor Relations Commission
(NLRC).


On 11 November
1998, the NLRC issued an order directing petitioners to submit an affidavit to
the effect that their appeal bond was genuine and that it would be in force and
effect until the final disposition of the case. In his reply memorandum, dated
28 November 1998, respondent, asseverating that petitioners failed to deposit
the required bond for the appeal, sought the appeal to be declared as not
having been validly perfected. On 19 January 1999, petitioners submitted a
manifestation and affidavit in compliance with the 11th November 1998 order of
the NLRC.
[1]

Apparently satisfied, the NLRC, on 30 April 1999, gave due course to the appeal
and rendered the presently assailed decision, reversing that of the Labor
Arbiter, to wit:


âWHEREFORE, the decision appealed
from is hereby SET ASIDE. However, respondent [before the NLRC] is hereby
ordered to pay complainant separation pay computed at one-half (1/2) month for
every year of service, reckoned from date of employment on October 9, 1990 up
to September 9, 1995, the date the complainant should have been redeployed.â
[2]


A motion for reconsideration, filed by herein private respondent
Valenzuela, was denied by the NLRC.


Valenzuela
forthwith brought the matter up to the Court of Appeals. On the thesis that the
only issue interposed was whether or not the NLRC committed grave abuse of
discretion when it took cognizance of the appeal and reversed the decision of
the Labor Arbiter despite the failure of herein petitioners to validly post the
appeal bond, the appellate court responded in the affirmative, set aside the
assailed decision of the NLRC and reinstated that of the Labor Arbiter. A
motion to reconsider the decision was denied.


In the instant
recourse before this Court, petitioners claim that the Court of Appeals
(Eleventh Division) has committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack
or excess of jurisdiction in declaring petitioners to have failed in perfecting
their appeal with the NLRC.


This Court finds
merit in the petition.


Private
respondent would posit that the appeal of petitioners to the NLRC should be
considered to have been made on 19 January 1999 (when petitioner submitted,
pursuant to the NLRC order, a statement under oath to the effect that the
surety bond it had posted was genuine and confirmed it to be in effect until
the final termination of the case) which was beyond the ten-day period for
perfecting an appeal. The records before the Court would show, however, that an
appeal bond was posted with the NLRC at the same time that the appeal
memorandum of petitioners was filed on 16 October 1998. A certified true copy
of the appeal bond
[3]
 
would
indicate that it was received by the Commission on 16 October 1998, the date
reflected by the stamp-mark thereon. The surety bond issued by the Philippine
Charter Insurance Corporation bore the date of 14 October 1998 or two days
before the appeal memorandum was seasonably filed on 16 October 1998. The
Order,
[4]
 
dated 11
November 1998, of the NLRC categorically stated that ârecords [would] disclose
that the instant appeal [was] accompanied by a surety bond, as the Decision
sought to be appealed involved a monetary award.â The NLRC, in fact, ordered
petitioner to submit an affidavit to confirm that its appeal bond was genuine
and would be in force and effect until the final disposition of the case. The
Commissionâs declaration that the appeal was accompanied by a surety bond
indicated that there had been compliance with Article 223
[5]
 of the
Labor Code.


An appeal to the
NLRC is perfected once an appellant files the memorandum of appeal, pays the
required appeal fee and, where an employer appeals and a monetary award is
involved, the latter posts an appeal bond or submits a surety bond issued by a
reputable bonding company.
[6]
 In line
with the desired objective of labor laws to have controversies promptly
resolved on their merits, the requirements for perfecting appeals are given
liberal interpretation and construction.
[7]


The only issue
on the merits of the case is whether or not private respondent should be deemed
constructively dismissed by petitioner for having been placed on âfloating
status,â i.e., with no reassignment, for a period of 29 days. The question
posed is not new. In the case of Superstar Security Agency, Inc., vs. NLRC,
[8]
 this
Court, addressing a similar issue, has said:


âx x x The charge of illegal
dismissal was prematurely filed. The records show that a month after Hermosa
was placed on a temporary âoff-detail,â she readily filed a complaint against
the petitioners on the presumption that her services were already terminated.
Temporary âoff-detailâ is not equivalent to dismissal. In security parlance, it
means waiting to be posted. It is a recognized fact that security guards
employed in a security agency may be temporarily sidelined as their assignments
primarily depend on the contracts entered into by the agency with third parties
(Agro Commercial Security Agencies, Inc. vs. NLRC, et al., G.R. Nos. 82823-24,
31 July 1989). However, it must be emphasized that such temporary inactivity
should continue only for six months. Otherwise, the security agency concerned
could be liable for constructive dismissal.â
[9]


Constructive
dismissal exists when an act of clear discrimination, insensibility or disdain,
on the part of an employer has become so unbearable as to leave an employee
with no choice but to forego continued employment.
[10]
 The
temporary âoff-detailâ of respondent Valenzuela is not such a case.


WHEREFORE
, the instant petition is GRANTED.
The assailed decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals are SET ASIDE and
the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission in NCR CN. 04-02620-95
is REINSTATED. No costs.


SO ORDERED.

Art. 223. Appeal. - Decisions, awards, or orders of
the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by
any or both parties within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such
decisions, awards, or orders. Such appeal may be entertained only on any of the
following grounds:


(a)
        
If there is prima facie evidence of abuse of discretion on
the part of the Labor Arbiter;


(b)
        
If the decision, order or award was secured through fraud or
coercion, including graft and corruption;


(c)
        
If made purely on questions of law, and


(d)
        
If serious errors in the findings of facts are raised which
would cause grave or irreparable damage or injury to the appellant.


In case of a judgment
involving a monetary award, an appeal by the employer may be perfected only
upon the posting of a cash or surety bond issued by a reputable bonding company
duly accredited by the Commission in the amount equivalent to the monetary
award in the judgment appeal from.


In any event, the decision of
the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the
reinstatement aspect is concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending
appeal. The employee shall either be admitted back to work under the same terms
and conditions prevailing prior to his dismissal or separation or, at the
option of the employer, merely reinstated in the payroll. The posting of a bond
by the employer shall not stay the execution for reinstatement provided herein.


To discourage frivolous or
dilatory appeals, the Commission or the Labor Arbiter shall impose reasonable
penalty, including fines or censures, upon the erring parties.


In all cases, the appellant
shall furnish a copy of the memorandum of appeal to the other party who shall
file an answer not later than ten (10) calendar days from receipt thereof.


The Commission shall decide
all cases within twenty (20) calendar days from receipt of the answer of the
appellee. The decision of the Commission shall be final and executory after ten
(10) calendar days from receipt thereof by the parties.


Any law enforcement agency
may be deputized by the Secretary of Labor and Employment or the Commission in
the enforcement of decisions, awards or orders.
