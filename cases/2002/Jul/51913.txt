SO ORDERED.


The facts of the
case are as follows:


On January 15,
1998, at about 2:30 in the morning, accused-appellants Erlinda Dela Cruz and
Larry Peridas went to the house of Meliton Estrella in Poblacion, Plaridel,
Bulacan on board a KIA Pride taxicab, which Dela Cruz drove.  When they arrived at Estrellaâs house, Dela
Cruz went inside to invite him to go with them, while Peridas stayed in the
taxicab.  When Estrella went out, he saw
a man lying on the floor of the taxicab whose head was being pinned down by
Peridasâ foot.  Afraid of being
implicated, Estrella refused to go saying, 
âIlayo ninyo âyan at baka pati
ako ay madamay.â
[4]
 Accused-appellants left and
proceeded to the house of accused Gerry Venturina in Baliuag, Bulacan.  There they stripped the taxicab of all its
accessories.
[5]


Later that day,
at about 7:00 a.m., Peridas returned to Estrellaâs house.  Peridas told Estrella that he had killed the
man and Venturina threw away the body in Pulilan.
[6]
 Since his clothes were covered with
bloodstains, he borrowed clothes from Estrella and asked him to burn his sando
and t-shirt.  Estrella did not burn the
bloodied clothes.  Instead, he turned
them over later to the National Bureau of Investigation Office in Pulilan.


Peridas left to
fetch the son of Dela Cruz. He returned to Estrellaâs house at about 10:30 to
11:00 a.m. There, he waited for Dela Cruz, who arrived at past twelve noon
driving the same taxicab Estrella earlier saw.  The license plate of the vehicle had been replaced from one bearing the
number: PVS 468 to one with the number: TAU 667.


Accused-appellants,
together with Estrella and Dela Cruzâs son, boarded the taxicab and drove to
Guimba, Nueva Ecija. Along the way, they were flagged down at a checkpoint set
up by the Traffic Command. Dela Cuz was unable to show her license and the
vehicleâs registration, but the police officers let them through after she told
them that she is the wife of Gerry Venturina.


They stopped by
Laur, Nueva Ecija to borrow money from a friend of Dela Cruz, after which they
proceeded to Peridasâ house in Guimba. That same night, Dela Cruz drove back to
Plaridel.  Before she left, Estrella tried
to borrow money from Dela Cruz for his fare back to Plaridel but she turned him
down. So, Estrella had to stay in Guimba for three days until he was able to
borrow money from Peridas on the pretext that he was going to fetch Dela Cruz.


When Estrella
arrived in Plaridel, he informed his elder sister about the incident.  Together, they reported the matter to Capt.
Ileto and SPO4 Ireneo Mauricio, then to NBI-Pulilan, where he turned over the
sando and t-shirt which Peridas asked him to burn.  The investigation led to the recovery of the corpse of Ysmael
Mananquil in Pulilan, Bulacan as well as the taxicab used by
accused-appellants, which was found five meters away from the residence of Dela
Cruz.  Eventually, accused-appellants
Dela Cruz and Peridas were arrested.


In her defense,
accused-appellants Erlinda Dela Cruz alleged that at 2:00 a.m. of January 15,
1998, she was asleep in her house in Ma. Lourdes Subdivision, Tabang, Plaridel,
Bulacan, together with her siblings, children and accused-appellant Larry
Peridas.  On January 16, 1998, she
stayed home to do her chores.  On
January 18, 1998, she stayed home in the morning and, in the evening, went to
the Monte Carlo Videoke in Baliuag where she worked.  She claimed that during all this time, she never saw Meliton
Estrella.
[7]


Accused-appellant
Larry Peridas likewise testified that he was sleeping in the house of Dela Cruz
on January 15, 1998, when the alleged crimes took place.  He stayed there for a few days and helped in
the housework.
[8]


One Reynaldo
Trinidad corroborated accused-appellantsâ testimonies that they were in Dela
Cruzâs house on the date and time of the alleged commission of the crimes.
[9]


After trial, the
lower court rendered judgment against accused-appellants.  Hence, this appeal, which raises the
following issues:


I


WHETHER OR
NOT THE SO-CALLED INVESTIGATION OF THESE TWO CASES HAVE BEEN IMPROPERLY MADE
AND WRONGLY EXECUTED.


II


WHETHER OR
NOT THE PRESIDING JUDGE RELIED HEAVILY ON WITNESS MELITON ESTRELLAâS PERJURED
TESTIMONY.


III


WHETHER OR
NOT CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ARE APPLICABLE IN THESE CASES.


IV


WHETHER OR
NOT DEFENSE EVIDENCE HAVE BEEN GLOSSED OVER AND GIVEN SCANT CONSIDERATION BY
THE TRIAL COURT.


In their joint
brief, accused-appellants allege that the following irregularities attended the
investigation of the case, to wit: (1) that nothing was done by the authorities
from the time Capt. de Armas of Plaridel called that a cadaver was retrieved
from Barangay Agnaya until January 22, 1998, when Inspector Ileto received
information about a carnapping and murder incident; (2) that Meliton Estrella
actually gave himself up for his implication in the murder and carnapping; (3)
that Inspector Ileto and SPO4 Mauricio did not conduct an investigation but
merely relied on the NBI report which was a complete falsehood; (4) that the
subject taxicab, which was parked adjacent to the PNP Crime Laboratory, was not
subjected to physical and forensic investigation; (5) that the NBI and PNP
committed shortcuts in pursuing the investigation; (6)  that NBI Agent Serafin Gil is not a lawyer
and violated their rights under the Miranda doctrine; and (7) that Inspector
Ileto is a graduate of Bulacan National Agricultural School with no background
in criminal investigation and intelligence.


The above
arguments involve factual issues, the resolution of which require our
re-evaluation of the trial courtâs findings of facts. To do so, however, will
be an unnecessary deviation from the jurisprudential rule that conclusions of
the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are generally not disturbed by
appellate courts. Trial courts are in a better position to decide the issues,
having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner
of testifying during the trial.
[10]
 The exception to this rule is where
there is proof of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence that might
have been overlooked, or its significance misinterpreted, by the trial court
which, if properly considered, could affect the result of the case.


After a
meticulous review of the records, we find no compelling reason to depart from
such rule.


The evidence on
record show that, contrary to accused-appellantsâ assertion, it was only on
January 22, 1998 that SPO4 Ireneo Mauricio, Capt. Ileto
[11]
 and NBI Agent Serafin Gil
[12]
 first came to know, through Meliton
Estrella, about the carnapping of the taxicab, the killing of the driver
thereof and the subsequent dumping of the body somewhere in Pulilan. Acting on
the information given by Estrella, they were able to recover the subject
vehicle at Dela Cruzâs house in Agnaya, Plaridel, Bulacan, and asked the family
of Ysmael Mananquil to identify his decomposing corpse.


Anent the claim
that Dela Cruz was arrested without warrant, forced to sign a document, and
detained for more or less 3 to 4 weeks,
[13]
 there is no showing that she
objected to the manner of her arrest and detention before she entered her plea
and participated in the trial. Pertinent hereto is our ruling in 
People v.
Lopez,
[14]
 to wit:


[I]t is too late for appellant to
raise the question of his arrest without a warrant.  When accused-appellant was arrested and a case was filed against
him, he pleaded not guilty upon arraignment, participated in the trial and
presented his evidence. Appellant is thus estopped from questioning the
legality of his arrest. It is well-settled that any objection involving a
warrant of arrest or procedure in the acquisition by the court of jurisdiction
over the person of an accused must be made before he enters his plea, otherwise
the objection is deemed waived.  Besides, this issue is being raised for the first time by
appellant.  He did not move for the
quashal of the information before the trial court on this ground.  Consequently, any irregularity attendant to
his arrest, if any, was cured when he voluntarily submitted himself to the
jurisdiction of the trial court by entering a plea of not guilty and by
participating in the trial.  Moreover,
the illegal arrest of an accused is not sufficient cause for setting aside a
valid judgment rendered upon a sufficient complaint after trial free from
error.


Coming now to
the sufficiency of proof of their guilt, accused-appellants contend that the
testimony of Meliton Estrella was perjured; that the evidence against them
consisted of circumstantial evidence which was not sufficient to establish their
guilt; and that the trial court merely glossed over and gave scant
consideration to the evidence they presented.


The contentions
lack merit. We agree with the trial courtâs findings that the testimony of
prosecution witness Meliton Estrella was clear, straightforward and devoid of
any signs of artificiality.  Moreover,
no improper motive was imputed on Estrella who positively identified both
accused-appellants as the perpetrators of the offense.
[15]


Accused-appellants
next assail the trial courtâs reliance on circumstantial evidence.  We have long held that circumstantial
evidence is sufficient for conviction in criminal cases where there is more
than one circumstance derived from the facts duly given and the combination of all
is such as to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt. The test for
accepting circumstantial evidence as proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt is:
the series of circumstances duly proved must be consistent with each other and
that each and every circumstance must be consistent with the accusedâs guilt
and inconsistent with his innocence.
[16]


In the case at
bar, the trial court based its judgment of conviction on the following
established facts: that Dela Cruz and Peridas arrived in Plaridel at 2:30 in the
morning of January 15, 1998 on board a taxicab; that the accessories of the
taxicab were removed and its license plate was replaced; that
accused-appellants were unable to produce the registration papers of the
vehicle; that the subject vehicle was identified as the one driven by Ysmael
Mananquil before its loss on January 15, 1998; and that the missing taxicab was
recovered by the police from Dela Cruz.
[17]


We find that the
foregoing facts constitute an unbroken chain of events that undeniably point to
the culpability of accused-appellants for violation of the Anti-Carnapping Act.
The testimony of Meliton Estrella was corroborated by the testimony of SPO4
Mauricio, NBI Agent Serafin Gil and Capt. Ileto. The testimony of the police
officers carried with it the presumption of regularity in the performance of
official functions.
[18]
 Moreover, accused-appellants failed
to overcome the disputable presumption that âa person found in possession of a
thing taken in the doing of a recent wrongful act is the taker and the doer of
the whole act.â
[19]


The trial court
convicted accused-appellant Larry Peridas only of homicide based on its finding
of guilt due to Peridasâ admission to Meliton Estrella that he had disposed of 
(tinapos)

Manaquil, whose body was dumped in Pulilan, Bulacan, where it was later found
by the police.  Prior to that, Estrella
saw Peridas stepping on the head of Manaquil on the floor of the carnapped
vehicle. In other words, it was Peridas who was with the victim when the latter
was last seen alive by Estrella.
[20]
 However, the allegations of evident
premeditation, abuse of superior strength and treachery as qualifying
circumstances were not sufficiently established, thus the crime committed was
only homicide.
[21]


In 
Aballe v.
People
,
[22]
 we held that the declaration of an
accused expressly acknowledging his guilt of the offense may be given in
evidence against him and any person, otherwise competent to testify as a
witness, who heard the confession, is competent to testify as to the substance
of what he heard if he heard and understood it.  The said witness need not repeat verbatim the oral confession; it
suffices if he gives its substance.


In the recent
case of 
People v. Zuela
,
[23]
 we ruled that an admission made to
a private person is admissible in evidence against the declarant pursuant to
Rule 130, Section 26 of the Rules of Court, which states that the âact,
declaration or omission of a party as to a relevant fact may be given in
evidence against him.â


In their
defense, accused-appellants can only raise alibi and bare denial.  Alibi is the weakest of all defenses,
because it is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove.  For alibi to prosper, it is not enough to
prove that the defendant was somewhere else when the crime was committed; he
must likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have
been at the scene of the crime at the time.  Furthermore, alibi cannot prevail over the positive and unequivocal
identification of accused-appellants. Categorical and consistent positive
identification, absent any showing of ill-motive on the part of the eyewitness
testifying on the matter, prevails over accused-appellant's defense of denial
and alibi.  Unless substantiated by
clear and convincing proof, such defense is negative, self-serving, and
undeserving of any weight in law.
[24]


The trial court
was correct in convicting accused-appellants separately on the charges of
carnapping and homicide, rather than 
qualified carnapping
 or 
aggravated
form of carnapping,
[25]
 as defined in Section 14 of
Republic Act No. 6539, as amended by Section 20 of Republic Act No. 7659, which
imposes the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 to death whenever the owner,
driver or occupant of the carnapped motor vehicle is killed in the course of
the commission of the carnapping or on the occasion thereof.


In the case at
bar, accused-appellants were charged separately with the crimes of carnapping
and murder. We cannot convict them of the crime of qualified carnapping, which
consists of the two crimes alleged in the two separate information, without
impairing their constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of
the accusation against them.
[26]


However, the
trial court erred in imposing the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 for the
crime of carnapping, considering that the Information neither alleged that the
victim was killed in the course of the commission of the carnapping or on
occasion thereof,
[27]
 or that the carnapping was
committed by means of violence against or intimidation of any person. The crime
alleged being only carnapping under the first clause of R.A. 6539, Section 14,
as amended, the proper penalty to be imposed must not be less than fourteen
(14) years and eight (8) months and not more than seventeen (17) years and four
(4) months. Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law
[28]
, if the offense is punished by a
special law, the court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence,
the maximum term of which shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and
the minimum term shall not be less than the minimum prescribed by the same.
Thus, we hold that the proper penalty to be imposed on each of the
accused-appellants is an indeterminate sentence of fourteen (14) years and
eight (8) months, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months, as
maximum.


On the other
hand, the penalty for homicide is 
reclusion temporal, 
the range of which
is from twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and
there being no modifying circumstance, we hereby sentence accused-appellant
Larry Peridas to a prison term of eight (8) years, four (4) months and ten (10)
days of 
prision mayor, 
as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, ten (10)
months and twenty (20) days of 
reclusion temporal,
 as maximum
[29]


Finally, we
reduce the award of Seventy Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) ordered by the
trial court as indemnity for the victimâs death to Fifty Thousand Pesos
(P50,000.00), consistent with current jurisprudence.
[30]


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the
decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 78, Malolos, Bulacan, in Criminal
Case No. 828-M-98, finding accused-appellant LARRY PERIDAS guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of homicide, is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that he is
sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of eight (8) years, four (4) months
and ten (10) days of 
prision mayor
, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years,
ten (10) months and twenty (20) days of 
reclusion temporal
, as
maximum.  In addition, said
accused-appellant LARRY PERIDAS is ordered to pay death indemnity to the heirs
of Ysmael Mananquil in the amount of P50,000.00.


The decision of
the Regional Trial Court, Branch 78, Malolos, Bulacan, in Criminal Case No.
829-M-98, finding accused-appellants LARRY PERIDAS and ERLINDA DELA CRUZ guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Republic Act No. 6539, as amended, is
AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that said accused-appellants are sentenced to an
indeterminate prison term of fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months, as
minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months, as maximum.
