PANGANIBAN, J.:


A writ of
preliminary injunction is issued to preserve the 
status quo ante
, upon
an applicantâs showing of two important requisite conditions; namely, (1) the
right to be protected exists prima facie, and (2) the acts sought to be
enjoined are violative of that right.  It must be proven that the violation sought to be prevented would cause
an irreparable injustice.


Statement
of the Case


Before us is a
Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the June 30,
2000 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals
[2]
 (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 53355.  The decretal portion of the Decision reads
as follows:


âWHEREFORE, the petition is
GRANTED. The Order dated April 19, 1999 insofar as it denied the petitionersâ
application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, is hereby
RECALLED and SET ASIDE.


âLet a writ of preliminary injunction
issue in this case to restrain the respondent bank from proceeding with the
foreclosure and consolidation of the title over the subject property upon
posting by petitioners of a bond in the amount of Php20,000.00.â
[3]


The Order of the
Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City (Branch 220), which was reversed by
the CA, reads as follows:


âWHEREFORE, premises considered,
the Order of the Court dated July 22, 1997 is hereby recalled and set aside.
The application for issuance of writ of preliminary injunction is hereby
DENIED.


âIssues in this case having been
joined, let this case be set for pre-trial on May 28, 1999 at 8:30 oâ clock in
the morning. Send notice of pre-trial to the parties and counsels.â
[4]


The
Facts


The factual
antecedents of the case are summarized by the Court of Appeals in this wise:


âPetitioner Pacita Africa (Pacita
for brevity) is the widow of Alberto Africa and the rest of her co-petitioners
are their children.


âRecords disclose that sometime in
June 1989, the Quezon City Hall building where the Register of Deeds was then
holding office was razed by fire, destroying some of its records/documents
among which was the original Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 203492
covering a parcel of land situated in Diliman, Quezon City, and registered in
the name of petitioner Pacita.  The
aforesaid property was part of the conjugal property of petitioner Pacita and
her late husband Alberto Africa.


âOn request of Pacita, private
respondent Macy Africa, the common-law wife of petitioner Antonio Africa,
worked for the reconstitution of the aforesaid TCT No. 203492.  The same was done and a new Transfer
Certificate of Title (TCT) No. RT-76140 (203492) PR-36463 was issued in the
name of Pacita Africa.  While the
reconstituted title was in her possession, Macy allegedly forged, or caused the
forgery of, Pacitaâs signature on a Deed of Absolute Sale dated December 29,
1992, purporting to transfer ownership of the subject property to Macy.  On the strength of the forged Deed of
Absolute Sale, Macy was able to cause the issuance of TCT No. 81519 in her
name, without the knowledge of any of herein petitioners.


âStill as part of the scheme to
defraud petitioners, Macy caused the preparation of a fake TCT No. 81519 in the
name of Pacita, which the former showed to the latter to make Pacita believe
that the said title was issued in her (Pacitaâs) name.


âSometime in March 1994,
petitioners discovered private respondentâs fraudulent act.  They (petitioners) likewise came to know
that the subject property was mortgaged by Macy to the respondent bank.  To protect their interests over the subject
property, petitioners lodged an action in court against Macy and the respondent
bank for Annulment of Title, Deed of Absolute Sale and Deed of Mortgage.  The case was originally assigned to Branch
99 of the RTC of Quezon City and docketed as Civil Case No. Q-94-20898.


âAfter the filing of the aforesaid
case, the respondent bank in utter bad faith, foreclosed the subject property
on June 11, 1996 without due notice to the petitioners, prompting the
petitioners to amend [their] complaint, this time incorporating therein a
prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of
preliminary injunction, to stop the respondent bank from, among others,
consolidating title to the subject property.


âOn July 2, 1997, RTC Branch 99
issued an Order granting petitionersâ application for a temporary restraining
order.  Meanwhile, the respondent bank
filed its Manifestation, Opposition and Motion to Postpone dated July 11, 1997,
praying, 
inter alia,
 for the denial of petitionerâs application for a
writ of preliminary injunction, or in the alternative, for the cancellation of
the hearing thereon.  On July 18, 1997,
the aforesaid court denied the respondent bankâs motion to postpone and
proceeded with the hearing of petitionersâ application.  Thereafter, petitionersâ application was
considered submitted for resolution.


âOn July 22, 1997, the Court issued
an Order granting petitionersâ application for a writ of preliminary injunction
to which respondent bank filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated July 11, 1997
followed by a Motion for Inhibition on January 1, 1998 praying that Hon. Felix
M. de Guzman, presiding judge of RTC, Branch 99, inhibit himself from further
trying the case.  This latter motion was
granted, and the case was re-raffled and assigned to Branch 220.


âOn April
19, 1999, RTC Branch 220, public respondent herein, issued the questioned
Order.â
 
[5]


Ruling
of the Court of Appeals


The CA
overturned the RTC Order dated April 19, 1999, and granted the issuance of a
preliminary injunction to restrain petitioner from proceeding with the
foreclosure and the consolidation of title over the subject property.  The CA ruled that respondents had title to
and possession of the property and were deprived thereof by petitioner.  Thus, respondents had a clear and
unmistakable right to protect their title and possession.
[6]


Hence, this
Petition.
[7]


Issues


In its
Memorandum, petitioner raises the following issues for the Courtâs
consideration:


I


âWhether the Court of Appeals acted
with patent grave abuse of discretion in applying the ruling in Verzosa vs.
Court of Appeals, (299 SCRA 100), to the instant case to justify its reversal
of the 19 April 1999 Order of Branch 220 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon
City in Civil Case No. Q-94-20898[;]


II


âWhether the Court of Appeals acted
with patent grave abuse of discretion when it rationalized its decision by
citing factual premises therein that are not borne out by the records nor based
on evidence and in fact contrary to reality[;]


III


âWhether the Court of Appeals acted
with patent grave abuse of discretion when it ignored, disregarded and/or
deviated from established jurisprudence governing the issuance of preliminary
injunction demanded by private respondents against the petitioner bank[;]


IV


âWhether the Court [of] Appeals
acted with patent grave abuse of discretion when it disregarded the pertinent
provisions of Section 3, Rule 58, of the Revised Rules of Court providing for
the grounds for issuance of preliminary injunction.â
[8]


In sum, the
issues boil down to whether the appellate court erred in issuing a writ of
preliminary injunction to stop petitionerâs consolidation of its title to the
subject property.


This
Courtâs Ruling


The Petition is
not meritorious; it has not shown any reversible error in the CAâs Decision.


Main Issue:


Propriety of Preliminary Injunction


Petitioner
argues that respondents do not have a right to the relief demanded, because
they merely have possession of the property, as the legal title is in the name
of Macy Africa.
[9]
 Furthermore, it claims that the
consolidation of title in its name does not constitute an âinvasion of a right
that is material and substantial.â
[10]


On the other
hand, respondents maintain that they would suffer great irreparable damage if
the writ of preliminary injunction is not granted.
[11]
 They likewise contend that if
petitioner is allowed to consolidate its title to the subject property, they
would lose their ancestral home, a loss that would result in unnecessary and
protracted proceedings involving third parties.
[12]


We agree with
respondents.


The grounds for
the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction are enumerated in Rule 58,
Section 3 of the Revised Rules of Court, which reads as follows:


âSec. 3. Grounds for issuance of
preliminary injunction. â A preliminary injunction may be granted when it
is  established;


(a)That the applicant is entitled
to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in
restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or
in requiring the performance of an act or acts, either for a limited period or
perpetually;


(b)That the commission, continuance
or non-performance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would
probably work injustice to the applicant; or 


(c)That a party, court, agency or a
person is doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or
suffering to be done, some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of
the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending
to render the judgment ineffectual
.
â


Injunction is a
preservative remedy aimed at no other purpose than to protect the complainantâs
substantive rights and interests
[13]
 during the pendency of the
principal action.
[14]
 A preliminary injunction, as the
term itself suggests, is merely temporary.
[15]
 It is to be resorted to only when
there is a pressing necessity to avoid injurious consequences that cannot be
remedied under any standard of compensation.
[16]


Moreover,
injunction, like other equitable remedies, should be issued only at the
instance of a suitor who has sufficient interest in or title to the right or
the property sought to be protected.
[17]
 It is proper only when the
plaintiff appears to be entitled to the relief demanded in the complaint.
[18]
 In particular, the existence of the
right and the violation thereof must appear in the allegations of the complaint
[19]
 and must constitute at least a
prima facie showing of a right to the final relief.
[20]
 Thus, there are two requisite
conditions for the issuance of a preliminary injunction, namely, (1) the right
to be protected exists prima facie, and (2) the acts sought to be enjoined are
violative of that right.
[21]
 It must be proven that the
violation sought to be prevented would cause an irreparable injustice.


Further, while a
clear showing of the right is necessary, its existence need not be conclusively
established.
[22]
 In fact, the evidence required to
justify the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction in the hearing thereon
need not be conclusive or complete.  The
evidence need only be a âsamplingâ intended merely to give the court an idea of
the justification for the preliminary injunction, pending the decision of the
case on the merits.
[23]
 Thus, to be entitled to the writ,
respondents are only required to show that they have the ostensible right to
the final relief prayed for in their Complaint.
[24]


First
Requisite:


Existence of the Right


In the case at
bar, we find ample justification for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction.
[25]
 Evidently, the question on whether
or not respondents possess the requisite right hinges on the prima facie
existence of their legal title to the subject property.
[26]
 They have shown that they have that
right, and that it is directly threatened by the act sought to be enjoined.
[27]


First,
 as alleged in the Complaint,
[28]
 Respondent Pacita Africa is the
registered owner of the subject property.  Her ownership is evidenced by the reconstituted Transfer Certificate of
Title (TCT) No. RT-76140 (203492) PR-36463,
[29]
 issued by the Registry of Deeds of
Quezon City.  
Second
, the
validity of the Deed of Sale
[30]
 dated December 29, 1992, is still
in dispute because Respondent  Pacita
Africa claims that her signature was forged by the vendee, Macy Africa.
[31]
 
Third,
 there is doubt as to
the validity of the mortgage in favor of petitioner, because there exists on
record two TCTs covering the mortgaged property: (1) TCT No. 81519
[32]
 registered in the name of Pacita
Africa and (2) TCT No. 81519
[33]
 registered in the name of Macy
Africa.


If indeed the
Deed of Sale is a forgery, no parcel of land was ever transferred to the
purported buyer
[34]
 who, not being the owner, could not
have validly mortgaged the property.
[35]
 Consequently, neither has
petitioner -- the buyer and mortgagee of the same lot -- ever acquired any
title thereto.
[36]
 Significantly, no evidence was
presented by petitioner to controvert these allegations put forward by
respondents.  Clearly then, on the basis
of the evidence presented, respondents possess the right to prevent petitioner
from consolidating the title in its name.  The first requisite -- the existence of a right to be protected -- is
thus present.
[37]


Second
Requisite:


Violation of Applicantâs Right


As to the second
requisite, what is sought to be enjoined by respondents is the consolidation of
the title to the subject property in petitionerâs name.  After having discovered that the property had
been mortgaged to petitioner, respondents filed on June 12, 1994 an action for
Annulment of Title, Deed of Sale, and Mortgage to protect their rights over the
property.
[38]
 This notwithstanding, petitioner
foreclosed it on June 11, 1996.
[39]
 To enjoin petitioner from
consolidating the title in its name, respondents then filed an Amended
Complaint,
[40]
 praying for a writ of preliminary
injunction.


Unless legally
stopped, petitioner may consolidate title to the property in its name and enjoy
the unbridled freedom to dispose of it to third persons, to the damage and
prejudice of respondents.
[41]
 What respondents stand to lose is
material and substantial.
[42]
 They would lose their ancestral
home even without the benefit of a trial.
[43]
 Clearly, the act sought to be
enjoined is violative of their proprietary right over the property.
[44]


A writ of
preliminary injunction is issued precisely to preserve threatened or continuous
irremediable injury to some of the parties before their claims can be
thoroughly studied and adjudicated.
[45]
 Denial of the application for the
writ may make the Complaint of respondents moot and academic.  Furthermore, it would render ineffectual a
final judgment in their favor or, at the very least, compel them to litigate
needlessly with third persons who may have acquired an interest in the
property.
[46]
 Such a situation cannot be
countenanced.
[47]


Lis Pendens


Petitioner
further contends that respondents are not entitled to the relief prayed for,
because they caused a notice of 
lis pendens 
to be annotated at the back of
TCT No. 81519, registered in the name of Macy P. Africa; thus, that notice
provided ample protection of their rights and interests.
[48]


We are not
persuaded.  A notice of 
lis pendens 
serves
as an announcement to the whole world that a particular real property is in
litigation and as a warning that those who acquire an interest in the property
do so at their own risk -- they gamble on the result of the litigation over it.
[49]
 However, the cancellation of such
notice may be ordered by the court that has jurisdiction over it at any given
time.
[50]
 Its continuance or removal -- like
the continuance or the removal of a preliminary attachment or injunction -- is
not contingent on the existence of a final judgment on the action and
ordinarily has no effect on the merits thereof.
[51]
 Thus, the notice of 
lis pendens 
does
not suffice to protect herein respondentsâ rights over the property.
[52]
 It does not provide complete and
ample protection.


Status Quo Ante


Petitioner
further claims that the RTC erred in enjoining the foreclosure sale of the
subject property.
[53]
 It argues that the foreclosure may
no longer be enjoined, because it has long been effected since 1996.
[54]
 We agree with petitioner.


It is a
well-entrenched rule that consummated acts can no longer be restrained by
injunction
[55]
 whose sole objective is to preserve
the 
status quo 
until the merits of the case are fully heard.
[56]
 
Status quo
 is defined as the
last actual peaceful uncontested situation that precedes a controversy, and its
preservation is the office of an injunctive writ.
[57]


In the instant
case, the 
status quo 
was the situation of the parties at the time of the
filing of the Amended Complaint
[58]
 with a prayer for a writ of
preliminary injunction.  It was that
point at which petitioner had already foreclosed the subject property and,
hence, could no longer be enjoined from going on with the foreclosure.  However, the last actual uncontested status
that preceded the controversy was when the property in dispute was still
registered in the name of Macy Africa, petitioner not having consolidated in
its name the title thereto.
[59]
 Thus, the issuance of the writ
would no doubt preserve the 
status quo
.
[60]


We cannot rule
on the allegation of petitioner that this case is a âscam perpetrated by
private respondentsâ to defraud it.
[61]
 The truth or the falsity of that
assertion cannot be ascertained by this Court at this time.  Verily, we refrain from expressing any
opinion on the merits of the case, pending a full consideration of the evidence
that would be presented by the parties.
[62]

DENIED
