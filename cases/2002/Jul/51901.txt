PUNO, J.:


Before us on
appeal is the consolidated decision of the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta
City, Pangasinan, Branch 46,
[1]

promulgated on August 8, 1998, in Criminal Case Nos. U-9631, U-9632, and U-9633
finding appellant Adriano Ponsica guilty of three counts of rape and sentencing
him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 in each case.


For allegedly
violating the womanhood of his 13-year old neighbor, Melba R. Quidem, appellant
was charged with three counts of rape in separate Informations, the accusatory
portion of each reads as follows:


Criminal Case No. U-9631


âThat sometime on April 3, 1998 in
the evening at barangay San Vicente East, Asingan, Pangasinan, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused entered the house
of Melba R. Quidem and once inside by means of force and violence, did then and
there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with said
Melba R. Quidem, a minor, 13 years of age, against her will and without her
consent, to her damage and prejudice.


CONTRARY
to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 7659 and R.A.
8353.â
[2]


Criminal Case No. U-9632


âThat sometime on April 7, 1997 at
barangay San Vicente East, Asingan, Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused by means of force and violence,
did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse
with Melba R. Quidem, a minor, 13 years of age, against her will and without
her consent, to her damage and prejudice.


CONTRARY
to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 7659.â
[3]


Criminal Case No. U-9633


âThat sometime on (
sic
)
November, 1997 in the evening at barangay San Vicente East, Asingan,
Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused by means of force and violence, did then and there wilfully,
unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with Melba R. Quidem, a
minor 13 years of age, against her will and without her consent, to her damage
and prejudice. 


CONTRARY
to Article 335, Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 7659 and R.A. 8353.â
[4]


Upon
arraignment, appellant entered a plea of Not Guilty to each of the charges.
Trial on the merits thereafter ensued.


It appears from
the evidence adduced by the prosecution that the victim Melba Quidem and
appellant in these cases are neighbors. Their houses, which are very near each
other, are located in San Vicente East, Asingan, Pangasinan. Since her family
did not own any television set, Melba would usually go to the appellantâs house
to watch television with other companions.


It was immediately
after watching television at the appellantâs house on April 7, 1997, at 5:00
oâclock in the afternoon, Melba recalled,
[5]
 
that the
first of the three incidents of rape happened. She and her playmates began to
gather at the house at 4:00 oâclock in the afternoon to view a telecine
program. After the program, which lasted for approximately one hour, her
friends started to leave. She was about to follow suit when appellant suddenly
placed a handkerchief in her mouth. He then carried her, using his two hands,
to a corner of the house. He forced her to lie down, face up, on the cemented
floor. He removed her shorts, together with her panty. After which, he removed
his own pants and pulled his briefs sideways, letting his penis out. He
inserted it into her sexual organ. The act caused her to experience pain in her
vagina. She put up a struggle in a desperate attempt to defend her honor. She
soon realized the futility of it all as the appellant was bigger and stronger
than her. In time, appellant succeeded in penetrating her. After satisfying his
carnal desire, appellant stood up, put his clothes back on, and left the place.
Melba subsequently went home. Upon reaching their place, she washed her vagina.
She chose not to tell her parents about the incident for the threat the
appellant made stuck to her mind: he will kill her whole family if she even
mentioned a word about the matter.


The second
incident of rape happened almost exactly the same way as the first one. Melba
was again watching television one night at the house of the appellant on the
third week of November 1997 with several companions. They stayed there up to
9:00 in the evening. After the TV program, the people headed home one by one.
Melba was likewise going to leave when she noticed that one of her slippers was
missing. She looked around, but could not find it, so she went home. While she
was walking, appellant chased her and overtook her. He grabbed her, covered her
mouth, and placed his hands around her. He carried her to a nearby bamboo
grove. At that time, he was wearing only briefs and 
sandos
. He forced
her to lie down face up then began to insert his penis into her vagina. He
thereafter made a push and pull movement. She noticed that something came out
of his penis which is hot and sticky. While in the process of making the push
and pull movement, appellant tore her upper garment. He sucked her breast
which, to her, felt very painful. After he succeeded in imposing his bestial
will upon her, he stood up and left his ravished prey. Melba headed home.
Before she went to sleep, at about 10:30 oâclock in the evening, she washed her
vagina.


The boldness of
the appellant seemed to increase, as he committed the third and last of the
rapes inside the very house of the victim. At about 10:00 oâclock in the evening
of April 3, 1998, Melba was roused from her sleep when she heard the door of
the house being opened. She got up, closed the door, and went back to sleep
with her two brothers. After a while, Melba was again awakened, this time
because she felt somebody on top of her. That somebody turned out to be the
appellant. Then she realized that his penis was already inside her vagina. His
knees were placed on top of her knees. She attempted to parry him, but instead
got boxed in the stomach. While he was making his familiar push and pull
movement, she felt enormous pain in her vagina. He also lowered her upper dress
to suck her right nipple. All throughout, she was just lying face up, with her
hands above her head as they were being held by the appellant.


Early the next
morning, Melbaâs aunt, Rosalinda Bitana, caught her crying.
[6]
 She asked
the girl why she was crying. The young lass told her of the rape. Feeling
compassion for her niece, she brought her to the Barangay Captain, who
accompanied them to the Asingan Medicare Hospital for medical examination.


Dr. Noemie M.
Taganas physically examined Melba.
[7]
 
Her
examination indicated the following external findings: swelling of both nipples
and swelling of labia majora, labia minora and clitoris. The following, on the
other hand, were her internal findings: (1) hymen ruptured showing incomplete
old lacerations at about 12:00, 2:00, 5:00, 6:00 and 9:00 oâclock positions;
hymenal orifice admits one finger tip with difficulty and pain; and whitish
discharge coming from vagina. She also found the presence of spermatozoa. Her
overall diagnosis is that the girl has lost her virginity. The doctor opined
that the laceration could have possibly been caused by a human penis, and that
the presence of wounds in different positions indicates that there could have
probably been several sexual intercourse which caused them.


After the medical examinations were finished, Rosalinda
brought Melba to the Asingan Police Station for the girl to lodge a formal
complaint against the appellant. When they arrived at the station, the police
investigator on duty, SPO1 Patricio Badua, Jr., investigated Melbaâs grievance.
[8]
 He took
her statements, which became the basis of the complaint he himself later filed
with the court.


In a bid for
exculpation, appellant interposed denial and alibi, contending that on the
dates the three instances of rape happened, he was in another place or
otherwise doing something else.
[9]
 The
defense called to the stand, aside from the appellant himself, the following
witnesses to corroborate his story: his wife Carlina Ponsica, his son-in-law
Virgilio Quidem, and his friend Romulo Lapena.


Appellant
declared that on April 7, 1997, he arrived at his house at about 2:00 oâ clock
in the afternoon. He came that day from his work at a machine shop owned by a
certain Jun Subido and located at San Juan, San Manuel, Pangasinan. As a
mechanic, he specializes in engine overhauling and welding. He went home
unusually early that day because his eyes were painful caused by the flaks of a
welding machine. He remembered that from 4:00 to 5:00 oâclock in the afternoon
that day, he was just seating with his wife in front of their house. After
which, his wife proceeded to fix the familyâs meal. At the dinner table, the
two of them were joined by their children, Novalyn and John Ponsica. After
finishing their food, they all prepared to sleep.  His wife  arranged  their  beddings  in  front of the television in the 
sala
,
where they all eventually retired. He admitted that he knows Melba, since she
was their neighbor. He, however, denied that the young girl would visit their
house to watch television. Also, he never recalled seeing her that day inside
their house or anywhere else. 


Carolina
Ponsica, the appellantâs wife, corroborated the story of her husband.
[10]
 She
narrated that her husband indeed arrived unusually early that day. They sat and
talked and whiled away the time in front of their house until she had to cook
dinner. They ate with their two children, Novalyn and John, before all of them
went to sleep. She and appellant slept at the sala in front of the television
while the kids stayed near their 
aparador
.  She stated that Melba never came to their house to watch
television, as their TV set was only black and white. She insisted that on
April 7, 1997, the girl did not go to their house.


The second rape,
which happened on the third week of November, appellant contends, could not
have also been committed by him. He claimed that on November 4, 1997 he went to
Abolog, Cagayan, where he stayed until December 27, 1997. He went to the
province in connection with a contract he obtained to repair a rice-milling
machine, owned by a certain Wilma Guillermo. According to him, in the almost
two months that he stayed there, not even once did he come home.


This story was
corroborated by his son-in-law Virgilio Quidem, who is also the first cousin of
Melba.
[11]
 He
testified that he accompanied appellant to Cagayan in the afternoon of November
4, 1997 to do some repair jobs on a rice-milling machine. He acted as his
assistant. They stayed there during the whole time of the project and only went
home on December 27, 1997.


At the time of
the third and last of the rape incidents on April 3, 1997, appellant similarly
maintains that he was not present at the alleged scene of the crime. He claims
that at approximately 7:30 in the evening, he went to the house of his friend
Romulo Lapena. There was a wedding celebration to be held there the next
morning and he volunteered to help in the preparation of the food. From 7:30
that night up to 5:30 the next morning, he kept himself busy cooking different
kinds of food.


This story was
confirmed by defense witness Romulo Lapena.
[12]
 He
testified that in the evening of April 3, 1998, both he and appellant went to
the house of his brother Alfredo Lapena, whose daughter was going to walk the
aisle the next morning. They offered their assistance as
 kusineros
 in
preparing the food. He remembered that when he arrived at his brotherâs house,
appellant was already there. The latter stayed with them until about 5:00
oâclock in the morning the next day when they all left together.


After analyzing
the evidence, the trial court adjudged the appellant guilty of three counts of
rape as charged in the Informations and meted out the penalty of 
reclusion
perpetua 
for each conviction. The dispositive portion of its consolidated
decision reads:


âWherefore, the Court finds ADRIANO
PONSICA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of RAPE under Article 335 of the Revised
Penal Code, in relation to Republic Act 7659 and the Court sentences ADRIANO
PONSICA, as follows:


1. In CRIM. CASE NO. U-9631, to suffer the penalty of  RECLUSION PERPETUA. To indemnify Melba
Quidem the sum of  
P
50,000.00 for
moral damages plus 
P
20,000.00 as exemplary damages;


2. In CRIM. CASE NO. U-9632, to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION
PERPETUA.  To indemnify Melba Quidem the
sum of 
P
50,000.00 for moral damages plus 
P
20,000.00 as exemplary
damages;


3. In CRIM. CASE NO. U-9633, to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION
PERPETUA. To indemnify Melba Quidem the sum of 
P
50,000.00 for moral
damages plus 
P
20,000.00 as exemplary damages;


x x x 
                                           
  x x x
                                   
x
x x


SO ORDERED.â
[13]


Taking vigorous
objection to the guilty verdict, appellant interjected the present appeal. In
his brief, he cited and argued the following issues:


âI - Whether or not the prosecution has established
beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused-appellant Adriano Ponsica in
the three (3) criminal charges filed against him?


II - Corollary issue on damages.â
[14]


The appeal is
bereft of merit.


Rape is
committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following
circumstances: 1) By using force or intimidation; 2) When the woman is deprived
of reason or otherwise unconscious; and 3) When the woman is under twelve years
of age, even though neither of the circumstances mentioned in the two next
preceding paragraphs shall be present.  The gravamen of rape is carnal knowledge of a woman against her will or
without her consent.
[15]


Appellant,
however, asserts that he cannot be held liable allegedly because  the prosecution failed to prove the element
of force or intimidation in the first charge of rape. He referred to the
testimony of Melba and noted how the penile insertion was made with facility.
He also tried to point out the apparent lack of force or intimidation on his
part as can be gleaned from the fact that he merely had to pull his brief
sideways before he was able to fully introduce his sexual organ into hers.


We disagree.
From the testimony of Melba, it is very evident how appellant used a great
amount of force to cower her into submission. He preliminarily grabbed her and
placed a handkerchief in her mouth, before carrying her to a corner and
coercing her to lie on the cemented floor. His hands tightly held her hands.
The resistance Melba offered were useless since he was far stronger and bigger
than her.  The fact that appellant
merely pulled his brief sideways should not be taken as an indication that the
intercourse was done with ease. It only shows that it was done in a hurried and
uncomfortable manner, which dovetails rather than contradict the version of
Melba.


Anent the second
incident, appellant again tries to impress on us that the sexual intercourse
was consensual. He found it unbelievable that Melba, after the first rape
incident, would still return to the house of the person who previously abused
her. Unless, he argues, the girl was asking for it. It also puzzles him why she
never revealed the alleged rape to any of her friends and relatives after the
incident.


That Melba
returned to the house of the very person who abused her and where the latter
forcibly imposed his bestial will against her does not necessarily imply that
she was asking for more. The only reason why she came back to appellantâs house
was because, according to her, she was more afraid to be left alone at their
house. Every time her family and friends would go there to watch television,
she explained that she did not have any choice but to go with them, thus: 


âCourt:


Q:
    
Why
did you still go and watch television in the house of Adriano Ponsica when he
had already forced you to have sexual intercourse to (
sic
) you? 


A:
    
Because
I saw children going to the house of Adriano Ponsica to watch TV, sir. 


Q:
    
Is
it not a fact that you hated Adriano Ponsica when he had sexual intercourse
with you the first time around?


A:
    
I
hated him sir.


Q:
    
Despite that hate, why must you have to go to the house and watch
TV?


A:
    
Because I am more afraid at our house because I have no companion
there, sir.â
[16]


Melbaâs
non-revelation of the first incident of the rape can be attributed to the fear
created in her mind by the various threats appellant made against her. To be
sure, appellantâs stern warning that he would kill her and her whole family
generated fright in the young girlâs mind. The threat for her was real and she
believed beyond doubt that her attacker was very much capable of making good
his threat. Under the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to expect that
the victim act with equanimity of disposition and to have the courage and
intelligence to disregard the threat made by the appellant.
[17]
 Verily,
her delay in reporting the rape in the face of threats of death or physical
violence should not be taken against her.
[18]


In the same
fashion, appellant contends that based on the evidence presented, the third
incident should not be considered rape. He argues that the act of Melba in
opening the door signifies that she already knew beforehand that he was going
there. Otherwise, if he just forcibly opened the door, it would have awakened
her two brothers who were sleeping with her. The appellantâs thesis is that,
while he and Melba were engaging in consensual sex, her two brothers were
awakened. Later they must have told their aunt, Rosalina Bitana, about what
they saw and it was the latter who instigated Melba into filing the complaint.


These arguments
are completely without basis. It is clear from the testimonial evidence on
record that it was not Melba who opened their door. In truth, she was the one
who closed it when, earlier that night before the incident happened, she
discovered it was opened. There is therefore no merit in appellantâs assertion
that Melba knew beforehand that he was going to their house, as a result of
which, she intentionally left the door open to expedite his entry. The fact
that Melbaâs brothers were not roused from their sleep when he forced his way
in is not improbable. We note that the crime was committed in the middle of the
night. It is at this time when children are in deep slumber and could not
easily be awakened.
[19]
 It is
therefore understandable why even if assuming the forcible manner by which he
entered the house created some noise, Melbaâs younger siblings continued their
sleep.


The attempt of
appellant to persuade us that the filing of the criminal case was due to the
instigation of Melbaâs Aunt Rosalina must fail in the absence of any showing
that the latter was impelled by improper motive in doing so. Normally, no
member of the victimâs family would subject the victim to the stigma and
embarrassment concomitant with a rape trial if he or she were not motivated
solely by an honest desire to have the malefactor punished.
[20]


Well to point
out is the sudden turnaround in appellantâs line of defense. In the trial
court, appellant was insistent in his claim of alibi and denial. He firmly
maintained that he did not engage in any form of sexual activity with
Melba.  On appeal, however, he changed
his account of the story and this time admitted that he and Melba indeed had
intercourse, only that they were consensual. His change in theory accentuates
his lack of credibility.  The second
version that he concocted on appeal is a mere afterthought and a desperate
attempt to escape criminal liability after his claim of alibi was soundly repudiated
in the trial court.


It bears
emphasis that when the offended parties are young and immature girls from the
ages of twelve to sixteen, courts are inclined to lend credence to their
version of what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability
but also the shame and embarrassment to which they would be exposed by court
trial if the matter about which they testified is not true.
[21]
 It is
instinctive for a young, unmarried woman to protect her honor and it is thus
difficult to believe that she would fabricate a tale of defloration, allow the
examination of her private parts, reveal her shame to the small town where she
grew up, and permit herself to be subject of a public trial had she not really
been ravished.
[22]


Before finally
disposing of these cases, we hold that a modification in the monetary award is
in order. The trial court did not award any civil indemnity in favor of the
victim as it just awarded 
P
50,000.00 as moral damages for each count of
rape. In accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, we grant another 
P
50,000.00
for each of the rapes as civil indemnity, which is automatically given to the
offended party without need of further evidence other than the fact of the
commission of the rape.
[23]
 
We also
find the award of 
P
20,000.00 as exemplary damages to be without basis.
Exemplary damages, under Article 2230 of the Civil Code may be imposed only
when the crime is committed with one or more aggravating circumstance.
[24]
 No such
circumstance has been duly proven in the cases at bar.
