SEBASTIAN GARCIA, PETITIONER,
VS. JUANITO A. PAJARO AND THE CITY OF DAGUPAN, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


The city
treasurer of Dagupan has the authority to institute disciplinary actions
against subordinate officers or employees.  The essence of due process in an administrative proceeding is the
opportunity to explain oneâs side, whether written or verbal.  The constitutional mandate is satisfied when
a petitioner complaining about an action or a ruling is granted an opportunity
to seek reconsideration.


Statement
of the Case


Before us is a
Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the June 17,
1999 Decision
[1]
 and the December 14, 1999
Resolution
[2]
 of the Court of Appeals
[3]
 (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 48285.  The decretal portion of the Decision reads
as follows:


âWHEREFORE, finding no reversible
error in the appealed decision, [this Court hereby affirms it] 
in toto
.  No costs.â
[4]


The assailed
Resolution denied petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration.


The affirmed
Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dagupan City (Branch 40),
disposed as follows:


âWHEREFORE, this case is hereby
DISMISSED, without costs.â
[5]


The
Facts


The factual
antecedents of the case, as summarized by the RTC and adopted by the CA, are
reproduced as follows:


âEvidence for the petitioner tends
to show that petitioner SEBASTIAN GARCIA, 61, married, employee at the City
Treasurerâs Office, Dagupan City and resident of Lucao, Dagupan City, has been
employee thereat since June 15, 1974 as Revenue Collector appointed to that
position by then City Mayor Cipriano Manaois.  He was ordered suspended by City Treasurer Juanito Pajaro from June 1,
1990 to March 15, 1992 and directed the withholding of his salary because of
the Formal Charge filed against him.  He
resumed work on March 16, 1992 as Local Treasury Officer III.  When he was suspended, his position was
Local Treasury Officer and Revenue Officer with a salary of 
P
6,800.00 a
month.  When he resumed work, his salary
was already 
P
7,615.00 monthly.  From June 1, 1990 up to March 15, 1992, he had been reporting for work
because he did not honor the suspension order as the City Treasurer acted as
the complainant, investigator and judge and there was no complaint against him
from the Office of the City Mayor.  He
did not believe in the Order; he did not submit himself for investigation.  He was not paid his salary because of the
suspension order which caused his sleepless nights, his two (2) children
stopped schooling, he has to beg from his relatives.  He has a wife with four (4) children in college, one in Commerce,
another taking up Dentistry.  During the
1990 earthquake, there was calamity loan granted to employees but he could not
avail of it because the City Treasurer would not approve the loan.  He is asking 
P
1,000,000.00 for his
mental anguish and sufferings.  From
July to October, 1987 the City Treasurer refused to give him his COLA,
differential, cash gift, salary and mid-year bonus amounting to 
P
6,800.00
up to the present.  His salary now is 
P
13,715.00
as Treasury Officer III.  Contrary to
the charges of the City Treasurer, he has been doing his duties and
obligations; that for the acts of charging him in the Department of Finance and
for charging him for neglect of duties, he felt deeply hurt and is asking 
P
250,000.00
for that; his agreement with his counsel is 
P
25% of what will be awarded
to him.

âEvidence for Respondent PAJARO
tends to show that


âJUANITO PAJARO, 65, married, City
Treasurer of Dagupan City, first served in concurrent capacity and OIC on
December 4, 1981 and was regularly appointed as City Treasurer on January 2,
1986 up to the present.  Petitioner
Sebastian Garcia is at present the Local Treasury Officer III but way back in
1990 he was Senior Revenue Collector whose immediate superior was the late Mr.
Viray, the Chief of the Local Taxes, then the Assistant City Treasurer, and the
City Treasurer himself.  Petitioner has
been rating Unsatisfactory in his performance for several semesters which is
the reason a [Formal] Charge was filed against petitioner received by him on
June 1, 1990, 10:00 a.m. and, as a matter of procedure, if the charge is a
major offense, by civil service laws, he was preventively suspended for ninety
(90) days, also duly received by Mr. Garcia on June 4, 1990 at 2:00 p.m.  Then an investigation was scheduled and a
subpoena was issued to Mr. Garcia to appear and testify on August 15, 1990 duly
received by him on August 1, 1990, 8:55.  Again Mr. Garcia did not Answer and refused to honor the subpoena to
submit himself for investigation.  So he
proceeded with ex-parte investigation and gathered and submitted testimonies to
support the allegations in the Formal Charge then submitted the result of their
findings to the Department of Finance for decision.  A Decision was promulgated by the Department of Finance on August
1, 1991.  The matter of preventive
suspension of Mr. Garcia was submitted to the Regional Director, Bureau of
Local Government Finance which was âfavorably approvedâ by the Regional
Director.  This case stemmed from the
application of the petitioner for the position of supervising revenue collector
and he was duly appointed.  The same
appointment was opposed by Mrs. Evangeline Estrada and by a resolution of the
Civil Service Commission, the appointment of Mrs. Evangeline Estrada was duly
confirmed.  Mrs. Estrada was recommended
first and she was issued an appointment by the City Mayor and was submitted to
the CSC.  It was contested by Mr.
Garcia.  The first ruling of the CSC was
adverse to Mrs. Estrada and she requested for reconsideration.  In the meantime, Mr. Garcia was able to get
an appointment from the same City Mayor but it was not approved.  The CSC reconsidered the request of Mrs.
Estrada favorably as shown by Resolution 91-359 dated March 14, 1991.  That position was affected by the
reorganization and it was changed to Local Treasury Operations Officer III now
occupied by Mrs. Estrada.  Despite the fact
that he was always u[p]held by the CSC and the Department of Finance, this case
based on unfounded allegations was filed against him, he is confirming his
counterclaim against the petitioner with 25% attorneyâs fees and 
P
1,000.00
per appearance.  Petitionerâs charge
that his benefits were unduly withheld from him is not true because the law
states when you are charged and preventively suspended, the salary could not be
collected.  As a matter of fact, the
petitioner was not acquitted; there was additional penalty.  He was penalized with a suspension of six
(6) months without pay so he could not by any means collect his salary.  On the other hand, he was the one being
harrassed (sic) by the petitioner; it has affected his performance and
efficiency in the office, including sleepless nights.  In explaining the entries in the Performance [A]ppraisal Report,
he said that the forms were given to the personnel to rate themselves and then
the final rating goes to the supervisor.  The personnel gave themselves excellent ratings but the basis of their
record is the true assessment made by the supervisor.  In this case, the petitioner should have protested when he
received his copy but he did not.  During the period of his preventive suspension, of course, the petitioner
did not receive his salary.  He is not
aware of the petitionerâs allegation that he reported for work during the
period of his preventive suspension, but that his co-employees testified that
petitioner timed-in at 8:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. but did not make âtime-outsâ.


âThe respondent City of Dagupan
adopted the evidence of respondent Treasurer Pajaro.


âAt the pre-trial conference, the
parties agreed to limit the litigation on the following issues:


1) whether or not petitioner is
entitled to right of action against the respondents; and


2) who is entitled to damages.â
[6]
 
(Citations omitted.)


Ruling
of the Court of Appeals


Affirming the
RTC Decision, the CA held that private respondent was vested with legal power
and authority to institute disciplinary action against subordinate officers and
employees.
[7]


The appellate
court further held that the requisites of administrative due process had been
fully observed by Respondent Pajaro while investigating petitioner.  But despite being informed of the charges
against him and being given the opportunity to be heard in a formal
investigation, petitioner chose not to answer those charges.
[8]


Hence, this
Petition.
[9]


Issues


In his
Memorandum, petitioner raises the following issues for the Courtâs
consideration:


âFirst:  Who has the power to remove, suspend or discipline the petitioner
as a local employee, appointed by the City Mayor, the latter o[r] the City
Treasurer?


âSecond:  Is the filing of the formal charge by the [private respondent]
with himself valid?


âThird:  Is the suspension of the petitioner by virtue of the formal
charge valid?


âFourth:  Who is liable for the unpaid salaries and benefits of the
petitioner?


âFifth:  Is the respondent personally liable for the damages suffered by
the petitioner?â
[10]


Simply stated,
the issues boil down to two:


1. Whether the city treasurer of
Dagupan can discipline petitioner 


2. Whether petitionerâs right to
due process was violated


This
Courtâs Ruling


The Petition is
not meritorious.


First Issue:


Disciplinary Authority of the City Treasurer


Petitioner
claims that the officer empowered to institute disciplinary proceedings against
him is the city mayor of Dagupan -- not the city treasurer.  He further asserts that under Section 78 of
the Local Government Code of 1983,
[11]
 the city treasurer does not have
the power to discipline him.


We are not
persuaded.


At the outset,
it should be pointed out that under the old and the present Local Government
Codes, appointive officers and employees of local government units are covered
by the Civil Service Law; and such rules, regulations and other issuances duly
promulgated pursuant thereto,
[12]
 unless otherwise specified.  Moreover, the investigation and the
adjudication of administrative complaints against appointive local officials
and employees, as well as their suspension and removal, shall be in accordance
with the Civil Service Law and rules and other pertinent laws.
[13]


The
Administrative Code of 1987,
[14]
 -- specifically Book V on the civil
service -- is the primary law governing appointive officials and employees in
the government.
[15]
 This Code enumerates the grounds
for disciplining them.
[16]
 They may be removed or dismissed
summarily â(1) [w]hen the charge is serious and the evidence of guilt is
strong; (2) [w]hen the respondent is a recidivist x x x; and (3) [w]hen the
respondent is notoriously undesirable.â
[17]
 Technical rules of procedure and
evidence are not strictly applied; due process in the administrative context
cannot be fully equated with that in the strict judicial sense.
[18]


The power to
discipline is specifically granted by Section 47 of the Administrative Code of
1987
[19]
 to heads of departments, agencies
and instrumentalities, provinces and cities.
[20]
 On the other hand, the power to
commence administrative proceedings against a subordinate officer or employee
is granted by Section 34 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of the said
Administrative Code
[21]
 to the secretary of a department,
the head of office of equivalent rank, the head of a local government unit, the
chief of an agency, the regional director or a person with a sworn written
complaint.


Further, the
city treasurer may institute, 
motu propio,
 disciplinary proceedings
against a subordinate officer or employee.  Local Administrative Regulations  (LAR) No. 2-85,
[22]
 which was issued by the Ministry of
Finance on March 27, 1985, authorized the minister (now secretary) of finance,
the regional director, and head of a local treasury or an assessment office to
start administrative disciplinary action against officers or employees
subordinate to them.  The pertinent
portions of LAR 2-85 are reproduced hereunder:


âRULE I - INSTITUTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS


âSec. 1. How commenced. â
Administrative disciplinary action may be commenced against a subordinate
officer or employee by the Minister of Finance, Regional Directors or heads of
the local treasury or assessment offices at their own instance (motu proprio)
or upon sworn written complaint by any other person.


âIn the case of a complaint filed
by any other person, the complainant shall submit sworn statements covering his
testimony and those of his witnesses together with his documentary evidence.

âRULE IV - HEARING


âSec. 1. 
Officer
authorized to conduct hearings
. -- The investigation shall be conducted by
the Minister of Finance or the Director for Local Government Finance or his/her
assistants or regional director or head of office concerned or the duly
designated representatives of said officials. The duly designated
representatives shall make the necessary report and recommendation to the chief
of office, regional director or this Ministry, as the case may be. The
investigation shall be held not earlier than five (5) days not later than ten (10)
days from date of receipt of respondentâs answer by the disciplining authority
and shall be finished within thirty (30) days from commencement of the hearing,
unless the period is extended or continuance allowed in meritorious cases.â
[23]


In the case at bar,
the city treasurer is the proper disciplining authority referred to in Section
47 of the Administrative Code of 1987.
[24]
 The term âagencyâ refers to any of
the various units of the government including a department, a bureau, an
office, an instrumentality, a government-owned or controlled corporation, or a 
local
government or a distinct unit 
therein.
[25]
 Respondent Pajaro, as the city
treasurer, was the head of the Office of the Treasurer; while petitioner, a
senior revenue collector, was an officer under him.  Thus, the city treasurer is the proper disciplining authority who
could investigate petitioner and issue a preventive suspension order against
him.
[26]


Petitionerâs
contention that it is only the city mayor who may discipline him
[27]
 is not persuasive.  Section 455 (b-1-x)
 
[28]
 of the 1991 Local Government Code
states that the city mayor âmay cause to be instituted administrative or
judicial proceedings against any official or employee of the city.â This rule
is not incongruent with the provisions of the 1987 Administrative Code, which
authorizes the heads of agencies to discipline subordinate employees.
[29]
 Likewise, the old Local Government
Code does not vest in city mayors the 
sole
 power to discipline and to
institute criminal or administrative actions against any officers or employees
under their jurisdiction.
[30]
 In fact, there is no provision
under the present Local Government Code expressly rescinding the authority of
the Department of Finance to exercise disciplinary authority over its
employees.
[31]
 By the same token, there is nothing
that prohibits the city treasurer from filing a complaint against petitioner.
[32]


As a corollary,
the power to discipline evidently includes the power to investigate.
[33]
 In 
Hagad v. Gozo-Dadole,
[34]
 we explained the rationale for
preventive suspension as follows:


âx x x.  Be that, as it may, we have heretofore held that, not being in
the nature of a penalty, a preventive suspension can be decreed on an official
under investigation after charges are brought and even before the charges are heard.  Naturally, such a 
preventive 
suspension
would occur prior to any finding of guilt or innocence.â
[35]


âx x x. Suspension is a preliminary
step in an administrative investigation.  If after such investigation, the charges are established and the person
investigated is found guilty of acts warranting his removal, then he is removed
or dismissed.  This is the penalty.
There is, therefore, nothing improper in suspending an officer pending his
investigation and before the charges against him are heard and be given
opportunity to prove his innocence.â
[36]


In the present
case, Respondent Pajaro was authorized to issue the assailed Preventive
Suspension Order against petitioner, because the latter was charged with gross
neglect of duty, refusal to perform official duties and functions, and
insubordination
[37]
 -- grounds that allowed the
issuance of such Order, as provided by Section 51 of the 1987 Administrative
Code.
[38]
 Clearly, the city treasurer acted
within the scope of his power when he commenced the investigation and issued
the assailed Order.
[39]


Second Issue:


Due Process


Petitioner
argues that his right to due process was violated, because he was not heard
during the administrative proceedings.
[40]
 We are not convinced.


In an
administrative proceeding, the essence of due process is simply the opportunity
to explain oneâs side.
[41]
 Such process requires notice and an
opportunity to be heard before judgment is rendered.
[42]
 One may be heard, not solely by
verbal presentation in an oral argument, but also -- and perhaps even many times
more creditably and practicably -- through pleadings.
[43]
 So long as the parties are given
the opportunity to explain their side, the requirements of due process are
satisfactorily complied with.
[44]
 Moreover, this constitutional
mandate is deemed satisfied if a person is granted an opportunity to seek
reconsideration of an action or a ruling.
[45]


In the case at
bar, the administrative proceedings were conducted in accordance with the
procedure
[46]
 set out in the 1987 Administrative
Code and other pertinent laws.  
First
,
petitioner was furnished a copy of the May 30, 1990 formal charge
[47]
 against him.  
Second
, Respondent Pajaro requested
the approval of the Order of Preventive Suspension
[48]
 in his June 1, 1990 letter
[49]
 addressed to the Bureau of Local
Government Finance regional director, who approved the Order in the First
Indorsement
[50]
 dated June 4, 1990.


Third
, a subpoena
[51]
 dated July 31, 1990 was issued to
petitioner ordering him to testify during an investigation on August 15,
1990.  However, he admittedly
[52]
 refused to attend the
investigation; thus, it was conducted 
ex parte
.  
Fourth
, the Department of Finance
affirmed Respondent Pajaroâs findings in its August 1, 1991 Decision,
[53]
 the dispositive portion of which
reads as follows:


âPREMISES CONSIDERED, [petitioner]
is hereby found guilty of Inefficiency in the Performance of Official Duty and
is hereby meted the penalty of six (6) months suspension from Office without
pay to take effect upon receipt of this Decision, pursuant to Memorandum
Circular No. 30, series of 1989 of the Civil Service Commission, with a stern
warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall be
dealt with more severely.â
[54]


We need only to
reiterate that parties who choose not to avail themselves of the opportunity to
answer charges against them cannot complain of a denial of due process.
[55]
 Petitionerâs refusal to attend the
scheduled hearings, despite due notice, was at his own peril.
[56]
 He therefore cannot validly claim
that his right to due process was violated.
[57]


As to
petitionerâs claim for damages, the extant rule is that a public officer shall
not be liable by way of moral and exemplary damages for acts done in the
performance of official duties, unless there is a clear showing of bad faith,
malice or gross negligence.
[58]
 There was no such showing in the
present case.

DENIED

and
 
the assailed Decision 
AFFIRMED
.  Costs against petitioner.

Jurisdiction.
 â (1) Except as otherwise provided by law, the head of a
