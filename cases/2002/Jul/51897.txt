PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. SERGIO CAÃETE, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


The brothers
Sergio, Alfredo, Ruben and Trinidad together with their 67-year old father,
Sotero, all surnamed CaÃ±ete, were temporarily detained at the municipal jail in
Liloan, Cebu in relation to a murder case filed against them for the slaying of
one Edith Tumayao. Upon learning that they would be â
salvaged
,â
 
they
refused to leave their cell and started a riot when the police came to transfer
them to the Cebu Provincial Jail.  For
allegedly bashing the head of his 67-year old father, Sotero CaÃ±ete, with the
wooden leg of a prison bunk during the ensuing melee, which resulted in the
latterâs death, Sergio CaÃ±ete was charged with Parricide in Criminal Case No.
DU-6233 in an Information
[1]
 which alleges:


That on the 1
st
 day of
June 1997, at about 9:30 oâclock in the morning, at Liloan Police Station Jail,
Municipality of Liloan, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to
kill, and by means of treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there,
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously strike the head of Sotero CaÃ±ete, his own
father, with the use of a piece of wood, which caused the death of the victim.


CONTRARY TO LAW.


Upon
arraignment, accused, assisted by counsel, pleaded âNot Guiltyâ to the charge.
[2]
 After trial, the court 
a quo
[3]
 
rendered judgment finding accused guilty as charged,
thus:


WHEREFORE, foregoing premises
considered, Judgment is hereby rendered finding the herein accused Sergio
CaÃ±ete guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of Parricide, the said
accused is hereby sentenced to undergo the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua 
and
to pay the costs.


Accused being a detention prisoner
shall be credited in the service of his sentence [the] full time during which
he has undergone preventive imprisonment.


SO ORDERED.
[4]


On appeal to
this Court, accused-appellant faults the trial court with the lone assigned
error that â


THE COURT 
A
QUO 
ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT
OF THE CRIME OF PARRICIDE.


Culled from the
testimonies of its witnesses, the prosecutionâs version of what transpired is
summed thus by the Solicitor General in the Peopleâs brief:


Accused-appellant
Sergio CaÃ±ete, his three (3) brothers Alfredo, Ruben and Trinidad, and their
father Sotero CaÃ±ete, were detained at the municipal jail of Liloan, Cebu, in
connection with the murder of a certain Edith Tumayao of which they were being
accused.  On June 1, 1997 at about 9:30
a.m., they staged a riot inside the municipal jail to prevent their transfer to
the provincial jail.  They threw stones
at the policemen outside the jail. The police had to use tear gas and water
cannons to flush them out.  Alfredo,
Ruben and Trinidad were forced to come out of the detention cell, while Sergio
and Sotero CaÃ±ete remained inside.  PO3
Ricardo Cabalda Enriquez then entered the jail followed by SPO2 Eleazar Salomon
and SPO1 Danilo Latoza.  Enriquez was
struck by accused-appellant with a piece of concrete on the right side of his
face. After he was hit, his companions Salomon and Latoza dragged him out of
the detention cell and brought him to a clinic.
[5]


Thereafter,
accused-appellant went amuck and started throwing broken pieces of concrete
from inside the jail. This compelled the firemen outside to fire their water
cannon at him to immobilize him.  The
policemen were then able to handcuff accused-appellant and pull him out of his
cell. The police then loaded the CaÃ±etes aboard the municipal service vehicle
and brought Sotero to the hospital while delivering the rest to the provincial
jail. Upon arrival at the hospital, Sotero CaÃ±ete was still conscious, but he
later expired.
[6]


Dr. Jose Dacudao
of the Don Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City conducted the
autopsy on the body of the victim.  He
testified that the victim suffered severe head injury due to a skull
fracture.  He also testified that the
victimâs chances of survival even with medical intervention was practically nil
and that he would have died owing to the severity of the injury sustained.
[7]


Accused-appellant
had a different version of the incident.


In a nutshell,
he claims that it was actually PO3 Ricardo â
Eking
â Enriquez who
bludgeoned his father to death.
[8]
 He narrates that he, his
victim-father and his brothers were the only prisoners remaining in detention
at the time because the others had already been transferred.
[9]
 They were ordered to come out of
their cell preparatory for transfer but they refused to leave because they
overheard Enriquez saying at the time they were incarcerated that they would be
â
salvaged
.â
[10]
 
They pleaded with their captors not to transfer them
to the provincial jail because it was a Sunday but their entreaties fell on
deaf ears.
[11]
 Thus, they refused to come out of
their cell, prompting the police and firemen to fire tear gas and water cannons
at them.
[12]
 Accused-appellant and his father
covered their faces to protect themselves from the tear gas and lay on the
floor when the water cannon was fired at them. As accused-appellant and his
father lay prostrate side by side on the ground, the police entered.  It was at that time that PO3 Enriquez
clubbed the deceased.
[13]
 Accused-appellant pleaded with
Enriquez to stop, but he was punched by another policeman named â
Toto
.â
[14]


Accused-appellantâs
account was corroborated by his sister-in-law, Charito CaÃ±ete, who was there at
that time.  She testified that shortly
after, tear gas and water cannons were fired into the cell, Alfredo, Ruben and
Trinidad called that they be let out.  Sotero
and Sergio, however, remained defiant and refused to leave. She overheard
Sotero say, âWhich of my children will come with me to the end?â and it was
Sergio who replied, âPa, I will be with you.â Water hoses were then fired at
the two (2) remaining prisoners. A commotion ensued and she saw someone with a
club enter the cell. She did not know what happened after that because they
were taken to a vehicle and padlocked inside for about thirty (30)
minutes.  After that, the vehicle was
opened and Sergio, who had several wounds on his face, was thrown inside. She
then stepped out of the vehicle and proceeded to the cell where she saw an
unconscious Sotero with broken wrists being carried by the police.
[15]


Accused-appellantâs
mother and widow of the victim, Florentina CaÃ±ete, confirmed Charitoâs account
of what happened. She testified that she was at the plaza on June 1, 1998 when
she noticed that people were converging towards the municipal hall. She went
there to find out what the commotion was all about and saw her husband and her
sons being fired upon with tear gas. She saw Charito waving at the police to
open the door of the prison cell because the inmates wanted to get out. Shortly
thereafter, three of her sons emerge from the cell but her husband and Sergio
remained.
[16]
 She was able to enter the municipal
hall but was prevented from going any further, was dragged out and locked
inside a truck.
[17]
 Later, she saw her husband and
accused-appellant being brought out. Accused-appellant, who was badly injured
and unconscious, was thrown inside the vehicle. She went with accused-appellant
when the latter was brought to the Southern Islands Hospital where her husband
was also admitted for treatment. On the 21
st
, they went to the hospital to secure a copy of the medical
records but they were not able to.
[18]


Generally,
findings of the trial court are entitled to respect, considering that it was in
a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves
and having observed their deportment and manner of testifying during trial.
[19]
 Nonetheless, this rule is circumscribed
by well-established exceptions.
[20]
 Thus, the factual findings of the
trial court may be reversed if by the evidence or lack of it, it appears that
the trial court erred.
[21]
 In other words, a trial courtâs
evaluation of the credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed on appeal
unless it is shown that it overlooked certain facts and circumstances of
substance that, if taken into account, could have materially affected the
outcome of the case.
[22]


In the case at
bar, we find several material circumstances which were overlooked by the court 
a
quo
, to wit:


First
, PO3 Ricardo â
Eking
â
 
Enriquez
claimed he was pounced upon and assaulted by accused-appellant who hit him on
right side of the head when he entered the cell. The severity of the alleged
attack which purportedly drew blood from the wound,
[23]
 coming as it does from a supposedly
desperate assailant, was such that he had to be brought to a clinic for
treatment by his co-policemen.  
However,
no medical certificate to prove the alleged attack on his person was
presented.  Neither was the supposed
weapon used in the assault produced to substantiate this claim. 
Indeed,
other than the prosecution witnessesâ bare avowals on this point, the wooden
post of the bunk or the piece of cement allegedly used in fatally bludgeoning
the victim was 
never 
presented in court. On the contrary, there is
evidence on record which shows that it was one of the responding policemen who
entered the cell where accused-appellant and his victim-father held out who 
carried
a club
.
[24]


Second
, the alleged assault imputed on the
accused-appellant and his father becomes even more questionable considering
that they both were forced to lay flat on the ground at the time Enriquez,
Salomon and Latoza entered because of the tear gas and water cannon fired into
their cell. In fact, the physical evidence tends to support the claim of the
defense that it was 
accused-appellant and his victim-father who were
actually assaulted and beaten up by the police. 
  The record discloses that a severely injured accused-appellant who
sustained many wounds on his face
[25]
 was taken out of the cell and
thrown into the truck.
[26]
 He was unconscious with 
broken
wrists
.
[27]
 Needless to state, such physical
condition renders impossible the prosecutionâs claim that he attacked the policemen
who came to take them out.


Third
, the prosecution witnesses, all of
them police officers who claim to have been at the scene of the incident, were
one in declaring that accused-appellant assaulted PO3 Enriquez.
[28]
 Curiously for all their supposedly
eyewitness declarations of what transpired inside the cell, they were totally 
silent

on the injuries sustained by accused-appellant, notably his broken wrists
and the wounds on his face. Interestingly too, the medical certificate
[29]
 issued by examining physician Dr.
Dacudao but signed by Dr. Lemuel Lecciones
[30]
 detailed only the head injuries of
the victim but made 
no 
mention of the other wounds he sustained and
described by Charito CaÃ±ete when he and accused-appellant were both thrown
unconscious into the truck.


Fourth
, even assuming 
arguendo
 that
accused-appellant and his father were dangerous inmates with a predisposition
for violence, as the prosecution pictured them to be, they practically had 
no

opportunity to perpetrate the acts imputed on them on account of the extreme
measures adopted by the police to subdue them.  It appears that tear gas was first fired at them causing them to cover
their faces to protect their eyes thus effectively limiting their movements.
They were next blasted with water cannon forcing them to lie prone on the floor
effectively immobilizing them. It was at this juncture, as they lay helpless
and vulnerable on the ground, blinded by tear gas and dazed from the pounding
they sustained from a high pressure water cannon, that PO3 Enriquez, SPO2
Salomon and SPO1 Latoza entered the cell.


Fifth
, the conveniently dovetailing
accounts of the prosecution eyewitnesses, all of them police officers belonging
to the Liloan police unit, with regard to the alleged assault on their
co-officer SPO3 Enriquez and the victim engenders doubt as to their
credibility. Identical features in the testimony of witnesses cannot but
generate the suspicion that the material circumstances testified to by them
were integral parts of a well thought-out and prefabricated story.
[31]
 It was in fact held in one case
that because of the close camaraderie that developed between the
witnesses-members of the same police force to which an accused belonged, they
could not be expected to testify truthfully.
[32]
 Furthermore, a circumspect scrutiny
of their testimonies shows that having testified uniformly only to material
facts, they have been forgetful or non-committal with particulars and details
having relation with the principal facts. Worth remembering in this regard is 
People
v. Alviar
,
[33]
 
where we said that:


. . .
â[i]t often happens with fabricated stories that minute particulars have not
been thought of.â
[34]
 It has also been said that
âan honest witness, who has sufficient memory to state one fact, and that fact
a material one, cannot be safely relied upon as such weakness of memory not
only leaves the case incomplete, but throws doubt upon the accuracy of the
statements made. Such a witness may be honest, but his testimony is not
reliable.â
[35]


Sixth
, the deportment of SPO2 Salomon on
the witness stand as he testified on the particulars of a serious crime which
claimed the life of the victim only deepens the suspicion of the prosecution
witnessesâ claims on the alleged culpability of the accused-appellant. He was 
smiling

even as he recounted the details of the supposed deadly assault by
accused-appellant on SPO3 Enriquez.
[36]
 It has been pointedly stated in 
People
v. Ganan, Jr.
[37]
 citing the old case of 
U.S.
v. Burns
[38]
 that:


The experience of courts and the
general observation of humanity teach us that the natural limitations of our
inventive faculties are such that if a witness undertakes to fabricate and
deliver in court a false narrative containing numerous details, he is almost
certain to fall into fatal inconsistencies, to make statements which can be
readily refuted, 
or to expose in his demeanor the falsity of his message
.


Seventh
, going by the account of the
prosecution witnesses that the accused-appellant and his father were desperate
and dangerous men with a propensity for violence, it stands to reason that they
should have properly armed and protected themselves against a possible assault
before entering the cell where the accused-appellant and his father defiantly
held out. SPO1 Latoza, however, declared they went inside 
barehanded
:


Q
     
So
that when you and your companions allegedly got inside the cell you were
already aware that there might be some untoward incidents that may happen and
you may sustain injuries and you were risking your lives and limbs?


A.
     
Yes.


Q.
    
Being
aware with that what precaution[s] have you made in order to avoid any untoward
incident that would happen to your lives?


A.
     
First
the door was sprayed with water and that is why we were able to have chance to
go inside.


Q.
    
What
do you want to impress [to] this Honorable Court is that while you were in a
single file going inside there were hoses which were directed to that area?


A.
     
Yes.


x x x
                                                
x
x x
                                        
x
x x


Q.
    
By
the
 
way, being aware of the risk that you faced at that time, of course
you did get inside the cell with some arms?


A.
     
No  sir.


Q.
    
Do
you mean to say you entered with bare hands?


A.
     
Yes.


Q.
    
Do
you want to impress [upon] this Honorable Court that you wanted to save people
who were very brave at that time and who threw stones at you as you said with
only your bare hands?


A.
     
Yes.
Because at that time there were only few stones left with them because (sic)
the others were already thrown outside.


Q.
    
While
you cannot see how many few stones left?


A.
     
That
is the work of the policeman and we are all indispensable.
[39]


Eighth
, the Court notes that the measures
the police adopted to get the inmates out of their cell were far too excessive
and unwarranted by the occasion.  Tear
gas was fired at accused-appellant and his father. They were later sprayed with
water cannon purportedly to immobilize them. The excessiveness of the means
employed by the police in fact conforms to the theory of the defense that it
was accused-appellant and his father who were mauled by the police to punish
them for their recalcitrance.  In the
process, the victim was fatally injured on account of the severe beating they
were subjected to.


Ninth
, accused-appellant, his
victim-father and his brothers could hardly be faulted for their fears that
they would be rubbed out because, aside from the declaration of SPO3 Enriquez
that they would be â
salvaged
,â
[40]
 
the record discloses that 
they were the only
prisoners left in the jail
[41]
 and there has been no satisfactory
reason given why they should be left behind instead of being transferred
together along with the other prisoners
.


The foregoing
circumstances, seemingly trivial when taken singly but decisive when considered
together, were glossed over by the trial court with the presumption that the
prosecution witnesses were in the regular performance of their bounden duties
at the time of the incident.  However,
it should be stressed that â[W]hile the Court is mindful that the law enforcers
enjoy the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties, this
presumption cannot prevail over the constitutional right of the accused to be
presumed innocent
[42]
 and it cannot, by itself constitute
proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.â
[43]
 The presumption of regularity in
the performance of official duty cannot be used as basis for affirming
accused-appellantâs conviction because âFirst, the presumption is precisely
just that â a mere presumption.
[44]
 Once challenged by evidence, as in
this case, xxx [it] cannot be regarded as binding truth. Second, the
presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot preponderate
over the presumption of innocence that prevails if not overthrown by proof
beyond reasonable doubt.â
[45]
 The presumption also cannot prevail
over positive averments concerning violations of the constitutional rights of
the accused.
[46]
 In short, the presumption of
regularity in the performance of official duty cannot by itself overcome the
presumption of innocence nor constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt.
[47]


The attendant
circumstances enumerated above, negate the presumption accorded to the prosecution
witnesses. Where inculpatory facts and circumstances are susceptible of two or
more interpretations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the
accused, while the others may be compatible with a finding of guilt, the court
must acquit the accused because the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral
certainty required for conviction.
[48]
 Viewed 
vis-Ã -vis 
the
peculiar factual milieu of this case, it is worth repeating what we previously
stated in 
People v. Ratunil
[49]
 that courts are mandated to put the
prosecution evidence through the crucible of a âsevere testingâ and that the
presumption of innocence requires them to take âa more than 
casual 
consideration
of every circumstance or doubt favoring the innocence of the accused.â
[50]
 It is a well-entrenched rule in
criminal law that the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its
own weight
[51]
 and cannot be allowed to draw
strength from the weakness of the defense.
[52]


In view of the
foregoing considerations, the evidence adduced by the prosecution failed to
overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence of accused-appellant. What
is required is that there be proof of beyond reasonable doubt that the crime
was committed and that the accused-appellant committed the crime.
[53]
 It is only when the conscience is
satisfied that the crime has been committed by the person on trial that the
judgment be for conviction.
[54]


All told, we are
not satisfied that the constitutional presumption of innocence accorded
accused-appellant has been overcome. Corollarily, we find it unnecessary to
examine the other corroborative evidence presented by the prosecution. Where
the principal and basic evidence upon which the prosecution rests its case
fails, all evidence intended to corroborate or support it must likewise fail.
[55]


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the
Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Mandaue City, Cebu, in Criminal Case
No. DU-6233, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  Accused-appellant Sergio CaÃ±ete is hereby ACQUITTED of the crime charged
on the ground of reasonable doubt.  He
is ordered RELEASED unless held for other lawful causes
