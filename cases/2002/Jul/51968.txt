CYNTHIA RESNGIT-MARQUEZ, SHIELAH J. RAMOS, ROSALINDA L. ROQUILLAS AND VICKY F. RAMOS, COMPLAINANTS, VS. JUDGE VICTOR T. LLAMAS, JR., REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 56, SAN CARLOS CITY, PANGASINAN, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




PER CURIAM:




A magistrate has to live by the example of his precepts. He 
cannot judge the 
conduct of others when his own needs judgment. It should not be âdo as I
 say and 
not what I do.â For then the court over which he is called to preside 
will be a 
mockery, one devoid of respect.
[1]
 


We are called upon to reiterate this dictum in the 
administrative matter 
before us. 


In an affidavit-complaint
[2]
 dated 
March 27, 1998, complainantsâ court employees Cynthia Resngit-Marquez, 
Shielah 
J. Ramos, Rosalinda L. Roquillas and Vicky F. Ramos charged respondent 
Victor T. 
Llamas, Jr., Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 56, San
 Carlos 
City, Pangasinan, with immorality and gross misconduct. They alleged 
that 
respondent judge, though married, maintains an illicit relationship with
 a 
married woman, Lourdes MuÃ±oz-Garcia, and both are living together as 
husband and 
wife under one roof; that the court sala of respondent Judge, as well as
 the 
office of his personnel, have been utilized as dancing halls and 
drinking wine 
rooms on office hours; that respondent Judge is drunk almost everyday; 
that 
respondent Judge is living a highly immoral and disgraceful life, and 
this is of 
open and public knowledge, and his mistress fondly calls him âDaddyâ, 
thereby 
trumpeting their affair in open view; that the complainant have been 
subjected 
to the intimidation and harassment by respondent Judge. 


In his Answer
[3]
, dated July 30, 1998, 
respondent Judge emphatically denied the accusations against him. 



In a Resolution dated June 16, 1999, the affidavit-complaint 
was referred to 
Associate Justice Romeo A. Brawner of the Court of Appeals for 
investigation, 
report and recommendation. 


Justice Brawner, after conducting the necessary investigation, 
submitted his 
Report and Recommendation dated September 14, 2001. Lengthy hearings 
were 
conducted on the case. Complainants Cynthia Resngit Marquez and Shielah 
J. Ramos 
and their witnesses Angelito Dixon Dispo, Engr. Librado C. Moises, 
Manuel 
Marquez, Atty. Leopoldo C. Tulagan, Sr., Atty. Omega Lacandola Moises 
and Mario 
Resultan testified in support of the complaint. On the other hand, 
respondent 
Judge himself testified as well as Lourdes Garcia, Angelica MuÃ±oz, 
Joseph MuÃ±oz, 
Gaudencio Sabangan, Benigno Abalos, Jr., Dolores Daligdig, Maura 
Doctolera, 
Andrew Mapanao and Rica Cabaccan. 


We reproduce the following findings of fact and conclusions of 
the 
Investigating Justice: 




â
Complainant Cynthia 
Resngit-Marquez
 is the Court 
Interpreter of the Regional Trial Court of San Carlos City, Pangasinan, 
Branch 
57 until she requested for a transfer sometime in 1994. The presiding 
judge of 
Branch 56 at the time she was the Interpreter was respondent Judge. 
During that 
time, respondent Judge already had a drinking habit that started 
sometime in 
1991. 


âIn February 1997, after his assignment in Dagupan City 
respondent Judge went 
back to San Carlos City. In March 1997, she saw respondent Judge again 
resume 
his drinking habits and he was always seen with a glass of wine in his 
hands 
roaming the Justice Hall premises even during office hours. He usually 
drank 
with lawyers and litigants and he would force his staff to drink with 
them. 
Should his staff refuse to join him, he would harass them. He loved 
drinking 
Carlsberg beer as he claims that it made him feel his young urges again.
 


âWhen complainantâs husband was in Saudi Arabia, respondent 
Judge would 
insinuate that it was better for her to have an old car she could use 
everyday 
rather than a new car that she could not use. Aside from the drinking, 
respondent Judge would also engage in singing and dancing in the 
courtroom even 
during office hours. The complainant identified the pictures (Exhibits 
âDâ, âEâ, 
âFâ and âGâ) showing the recreation area behind the Justice Hall and the
 
corridor leading to the courtroom where respondent Judge conducted his 
drinking 
sessions. 


âAfter respondent Judgeâs return to San Carlos City, 
complainant saw Lourdes 
MuÃ±oz Garcia almost everyday, as respondent Judge would drop her at her 
place of 
work at City Hall every morning. Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia would usually 
appear again 
every lunchtime to join respondent Judge and would come back again in 
the 
afternoon after office hours and they would leave walking side by side 
with 
their arms sometimes touching each other. During the occasions that 
Lourdes 
MuÃ±oz Garcia was in the office of respondent Judge, she would address 
him as 
âDaddyâ or âMasikenâ (Pangasinense for old man). 


âAll the time that respondent Judge had been assigned in San 
Carlos City, he 
resided near the cemetery in Karaengan, San Carlos City then near the 
school in 
Bulingit, San Carlos City and after his stint in Dagupan City, he stayed
 at 
Gabon, Calasiao, Pangasinan. In all these places, respondent Judge lived
 with 
Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia. 


âDuring her cross-examination, she admitted that a previous 
case was filed 
against respondent Judge charging him for the same offenses as this 
present 
case. Although she states that she had nothing to do with the case it 
appears 
that the Motion to Dismiss said case (Exhibit â14â) was signed by her 
and her 
father, which motion paved the way for the dismissal of Administrative 
Matter 
No. 95-3-88 (Exhibit â15â). 


âAngelito Dixon Dispo
 is employed 
as Clerk III in the Office 
of the Clerk of the Regional Trial Court in San Carlos City, Pangasinan 
since 
October 3, 1993. Almost everyday, part of his duties included buying 
liquor for 
respondent Judge at the nearby grocery that the judge and some lawyers 
partook 
of in the courtroom. Aside from his drinking, there was singing with the
 use of 
the sing-along machine in the courtroom of RTC Branch 56 where the 
respondent 
Judge was presiding. Some private practitioners and prosecutors would 
join in 
the merrymaking that happened as often as thrice a week in the courtroom
 of 
respondent Judge. During these times, the noise emanating from his 
courtroom 
could be heard downstairs. 


âAt that time, respondent Judge was residing at Barangay 
Kariinan, San Carlos 
City. There was a time that the house of respondent Judge was flooded 
and 
Angelito Dispo was ordered to go there to pile sandbags. At respondent 
Judgeâs 
residence, he came upon Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia attired in shorts and 
undershirt 
(sando) supervising the piling of sandbags. 


âOn December 1, 1994, he was again at the house of respondent 
Judge 
butchering a goat in preparation for the birthday celebration of Lourdes
 MuÃ±oz 
Garcia the following day. That afternoon, while he was washing the 
dishes, 
respondent Judge and Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia were embracing and kissing 
each other 
on the lips. 


âIt was March 28, 1995 or a day before respondent Judgeâs 
birthday party that 
found Angelito Dispo again at his (Judge) residence where he was helping
 in the 
preparations for the birthday celebration. Again, Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia 
was 
present and again she was attired in her shorts and undershirt without 
anything 
beneath her shirt. He noticed that the respondent Judge and this woman 
were very 
sweet with one another. 


âHe would always see Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia in the office of 
respondent Judge 
at RTC Branch 56 almost four times every week and they would intimately 
refer to 
each other as âDaddyâ and âMommy.â 


âAt the time he testified in this investigation on September 
14, 1999, 
Angelito Dispo stated that respondent Judge lives in Barangay Gabon, 
Calasiao, 
Pangasinan with Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia and the latterâs daughter. 



âOn September 3, 1999, respondent Judge went to Angelito 
Dispoâs house and 
told him not to testify against him (Judge) in this case. Angelito had 
this 
incident recorded in the police blotter (Exhibit âBâ). 


â
Engr. Librado C. Moises
 took up 
the tale and testified that 
sometime in December 1997, he went to the house of respondent Judge in 
Gabon, 
Calasiao, Pangasinan to attend a party held there in honor of some 
sisters of 
respondent Judge who had just arrived from the United States. He was 
with some 
court personnel as Clerk of Court Atty. Omega Lacandola Moises is his 
wife. At 
the party, it was Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia, attired in a housedress, who was
 
attending to their needs and serving as hostess for respondent Judge. 
When they 
left, Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia stayed behind. 


â
Manuel Marquez 
testified that 
while he was in the employ of 
the Central Pangasinan Electric Company from 1995 to 1998, he would 
often visit 
his wife, complainant Cynthia Marquez, in the court where she was 
working and he 
would see respondent Judge singing and dancing with some of his female 
staff as 
early as 3:00 or 4:00 oâclock in the afternoon for as many as 4 times a 
month. 
Pointing to the picture marked Exhibit âAâ and Exhibit â1,â he described
 that 
the benches were moved towards the table of the Presiding Judge in the 
courtroom 
thus creating more space for their dancing. 


âAs stenographer of RTC Branch 57 in San Carlos City, 
complainant 

Shielah Ramos
 stated that she has known 
respondent Judge since 
1989 when she first entered the courtâs employ. Since 1996 she has seen 
respondent Judge and Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia together both in the old 
building 
housing the courtrooms as well as in the new Justice Hall. She would see
 them 
eat their meals together at lunchtime and go home together after office 
hours. 
During the singing and dancing sessions conducted by respondent Judge in
 the 
courtrooms almost everyday and during special occasions, Lourdes Garcia 
would 
always be with respondent Judge. 


âSometime in January 1998, she saw them together at respondent 
Judgeâs rented 
house in Gabon, Calasiao, Pangasinan. Respondent Judge was with his dog 
while 
Lourdes Garcia was dusting his car. Confronted with pictures of the 
rented 
house, the two cars and the dog (Exhibits â3-Aâ to â3-Câ), Shielah Ramos
 pointed 
to the new car as the one being dusted by Lourdes Garcia when she 
happened to 
pass by. 


â
Atty. Leopoldo C. Tulagan, Sr.
 
took the witness stand and 
manifested that as law practitioner with an office in San Carlos City, 
he knows 
respondent Judge ever since he came to preside over RTC Branch 56. 
Sometime in 
1995, there was what he called a âhappy hourâ every Thursday in the 
courtroom of 
respondent Judge. Proceedings would be suspended and all lawyers then 
appearing 
would be invited to a drinking spree right in the courtroom. The lawyers
 would 
contribute to buy wine and finger food. There would be singing with even
 the 
court personnel participating. This practice stopped when respondent 
Judge was 
transferred to Dagupan City. However, when he returned to San Carlos 
City in 
1997, the drinking and singing sessions resumed. This time there was 
even 
dancing and these all happened sometimes once or twice a week. 



âOn one birthday occasion of respondent Judge, a Vice-Governor 
Llamas of 
Tarlac was present. Two ladies were requested to give a number and they 
were 
both introduced as Mrs. Llamas and Mrs. Llamas, one of them was the lady
 
companion of Vice-Governor Llamas and the other was Lourdes Garcia. 

âWhen 
respondent Judge went back to San Carlos City in 1997, Atty. Tulagan 
often saw 
Lourdes Garcia going to his courtroom for as many as five or six times a
 week. 
Further, on several occasions, he saw them together in respondent 
Judgeâs car as 
the Judge would bring her to City Hall where she was employed and fetch 
her 
again in the afternoon. 


âIn an earlier case filed by Atty. Antonio Resngit and 
complainant Cynthia 
Marquez, Atty. Tulagan executed an affidavit (Exhibit âCâ) before the 
National 
Bureau of Investigation supporting the allegations of the complainants. 



âA
tty. Omega Lacandola Moises
, 
another witness for the 
complainants testified that sometime in November 1993, Lourdes MuÃ±oz 
Garcia 
fetched her and together they went to respondent Judgeâs house in 
Karaenan, San 
Carlos City. Again, during an office day in May 1994, she went to 
respondent 
Judgeâs rented house as there was a celebration of some sort and that 
was where 
she had lunch. Respondent Judge had just arrived from the United States 
and 
Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia who was also there gave her âpasalubong.â 



âOn December 2, 1994, she again went to respondent Judgeâs 
house and had 
lunch there, as it was the birthday celebration of Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia.
 Present 
during the occasion were the relatives of Lourdes Garcia as well as her 
officemates and wife of former San Carlos City Mayor Douglas Soriano. 
Sometime 
in June 1997, she, her husband and her brother went to respondent 
Judgeâs house 
in Gabon, Calasiao as the latter had just arrived from another trip to 
the 
United States and Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia was again at the house. 



âIn December 1997, she was invited to respondent Judgeâs house,
 as it was the 
birthday celebration of Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia as well as a welcome for 
respondent 
Judgeâs brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces who had just arrived from 
the 
United States for a visit. As they arrived early, Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia 
was still 
in her housedress but she eventually changed into something suitable for
 the 
occasion. Pictures (Exhibits âNâ and âOâ also âExhibits â18â and â19â) 
of the 
persons present at the occasion were presented to her and she identified
 them. 



âAnother birthday party for Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia took place in 
an apartment 
rented by respondent Judge and Lourdes Garcia in Bonoan, Dagupan City. 
Atty. 
Moises together with Atty. Geraldine Baniqued and Geraldineâs husband 
were in 
attendance but as it was a workday, they only stayed long enough to 
finish their 
lunch. 


âOn the occasion of respondent Judgeâs birthday on March 29, 
Lourdes MuÃ±oz 
Garcia fetched her at lunchtime and brought her to that same rented 
apartment in 
Bonoan. She soon left after lunch but she went âback alone, Lourdes 
remaining 
behind to attend to the guests of respondent Judge. 


â
Mario Resultan
 testified that as 
sheriff of RTC Branch 56 
at San Carlos City presided by respondent Judge, he is aware and knows 
that 
Judge Llamas and Lourdes Garcia have been living together as husband and
 wife 
since 1990 up to the present. They first stayed at Valerio Hall, Mabini 
Street 
then they transferred to Balingit Street, followed by Kareanan Street, 
all in 
San Carlos City. They also stayed together in Calasiao, Pangasinan and 
Dagupan 
City. 


âIn all these places of residence, Mario Resultan was usually 
invited by 
respondent Judge and they would drink and sing. During these sessions, 
Lourdes 
Garcia would always attend to their needs, sometimes in her street 
clothes but 
oftentimes in her house clothes. 


âOn February 19, 1994, Mario Resultan went along with 
respondent Judge to 
Manila to confirm his flight as Judge Llamas was leaving for the United 
States 
the following day. With them on this trip were Lourdes Garcia and 
respondent 
Judgeâs sister, Evelyn Llamas. They spent the night in the house of the 
brother 
of respondent Judgeâs sister-in-law. He slept in the living room while 
respondent Judge and Lourdes Garcia shared one room. 


âAs he would be out of the country, respondent Judge executed a
 Special Power 
of Attorney in favor of Mario Resultan authorizing him to receive all 
his checks 
covering his salaries and allowances, encashing these and delivering the
 money 
to Lourdes Garcia. He did what was asked of him and each time he would 
deliver 
the money to Lourdes Garcia, he would indicate the dates and the amounts
 in his 
diary (Exhibit âPâ). 


âAgainst all these evidence, respondent Judge denies the 
charge. 


âJudge Llamas claims that complainant Cynthia Resngit Marquez 
has an ax to 
grind against him for objecting to her application as Legal Researcher 
of his 
court, RTC Branch 56, and instead endorsing Aldrin Lee who was 
eventually 
appointed to the position. Because he did not accede to her request, 
complainant 
and his father filed several charges against him ranging from immorality
 to 
harassment of court employees to high-handedness and arrogance. However,
 these 
cases were eventually dismissed by the Supreme Court (Exhibit â15â) on 
motion of 
complainant Cynthia Marquez and her father, Atty. Antonio Resngit 
(Exhibit 
â14â). But the trouble between respondent Judge and complainant did not 
stop 
there as could be seen in several cases filed by complainant against him
 before 
the Office of the Ombudsman. These cases were again dismissed (Exhibit 
â20-Aâ). 
He therefore considers this present charge as another form of harassment
 
employed by complainant in her avid desire to oust him from his present 
position. 


âFurther, he denies ever drinking and dancing in his courtroom 
as he claims 
there are several restaurants outside the office equipped with the 
necessary 
facilities for his pleasure. Besides if ever he drinks with a visitor, 
it was 
part of his hospitable nature and it was always done after office hours.
 


âAs to the charge of immorality, he emphatically denied that he
 has an 
amorous relationship with Lourdes Garcia. He is a married man and his 
family 
lives in Dagupan City. However, he is estranged from his wife due to 
irreconcilable differences in the rearing of their children. This does 
not mean 
however that he maintains an illicit relationship with Lourdes Garcia. 
He does 
admit that he knows the woman as she is an employee at the City Legal 
Office and 
it is her responsibility to look into the status of cases filed by San 
Carlos 
City pending in the courts. 


âRespondent Judge claims that all the testimonies of the 
complainants and 
their witnesses in so far as they saw him and Lourdes Garcia always 
together on 
several occasions, either walking side by side or riding in his car 
together or 
him dropping and fetching her at her place of work are all impossible 
and 
figments of their fertile imagination. They did not live together in all
 the 
places mentioned and definitely he would not be celebrating Lourdes 
Garciaâs 
birthdays for her in his own residence. If ever he was seen in the 
company of 
the woman, it was on social occasions when they would either be guests 
or she 
was a guest at a party he tenders. 


âHis emphatic denial is supported by his witnesses, Lourdes 
Garcia, Angelica 
MuÃ±oz, Joseph MuÃ±oz, Gaudencio Sabangan, Benigno Abalos, Jr., Dolores 
Daligdig, 
Maura Doctolera, Andrew Mapanao and Rica Cabaccan. 


â
Lourdes Garcia 
states that she 
first knew respondent Judge 
when she was detailed at the City Prosecutorâs Office and it was her 
responsibility to get the court calendars for the guidance of the Court 
Prosecutors. 


âIt was Gaudencio Sabangan who introduced respondent Judge to 
her formally on 
November 30, 1990 during the occasion of the birthday of Normida 
Sabangan, 
Lourdesâs niece and Gaudencio Sabanganâs granddaughter. They were both 
guests at 
the party and from then on whenever they would see each other they would
 engage 
in casual conversations. 


âAside from this, it was respondent Judge who helped her get 
her permanent 
appointment as Administrative Officer in the City Legal Office at San 
Carlos 
City. Respondent Judge being close with then Mayor Soriano, he paved the
 way for 
her being detailed at that office where she was given a permanent 
position.


âIn 1993 respondent Judge asked her whether she could recommend
 somebody to 
do his laundry. She volunteered her mother and thus the relationship 
between her 
family and respondent Judge became closer. When her mother became sick 
and could 
not do the laundry anymore, her younger sister and brother stayed with 
respondent Judge and did the household chores for him in exchange for 
allowances 
and tuition fee.


âLourdes Garcia further stated that she is a married woman who 
has stayed all 
her life in Barangay Roxas, San Carlos City except for that year in 1982
 when 
she went to live in Victoria, Tarlac, her husbandâs place but when she 
was about 
to give birth, she went back to San Carlos âCity and has remained there.
 She 
absolutely denies living with respondent Judge and states that the only 
time she 
went to respondent Judgeâs place was when she tagged along with her 
superior to 
attend the party given by the Judge in honor of his nephews and nieces 
who 
arrived from the United States.


âAs for her presence at the Justice Hall, she admits going 
there but her 
visits are all in connection with her work and since she has a lot of 
friends 
there, she drops on them for a chat before going back to the City Hall 
where she 
has her office.


âShe states that she was likewise charged with immorality at 
the Civil 
Service Commission in May 1998 but the case was dismissed in April 1999.
 


âHer mother 
Angelica MuÃ±oz 

confirms her story and states 
that she did the laundry of respondent Judge but subsequently turned it 
over to 
her younger daughter. Also, she says that indeed her daughter Lourdes 
always 
stayed at their house and never lived with respondent Judge. She claims 
that her 
daughter is married to a soldier but admits that her son-in-law does not
 stay 
with his family as in fact she has not seen him for a long time now. 



âAmidst all these conflicting testimonies given by all those 
who took part in 
these very lengthy proceedings, it behooves upon the Investigating 
Justice to 
determine whether or not the complainants have been able to prove their 
charges 
against respondent Judge. 


âRespondent Judge is charged with Immorality and Gross 
Misconduct. According 
to the complainants and their witnesses, his misconduct consists in his 
drinking, singing and dancing with lawyers and court personnel in his 
courtroom 
during office hours almost everyday. 


âThe Investigating Justice believes that indeed respondent 
Judge used his 
court to indulge his drinking, singing and dancing habits to the 
detriment of 
the other courts within the building who were disturbed by all the noise
 coming 
from his courtroom. This conduct unbecoming of a Judge deserves a 
reprimand but 
this administrative misdemeanor may be relegated to the background in 
the face 
of the more serious charge of Immorality. 


âThe complainants and their witnesses all gave positive 
testimonies of how 
respondent Judge flaunted his mistress in the eyes of the public. 
Bringing and 
picking her up from work, dancing and singing with her in public, living
 with 
her in different places, celebrating her birthdays with parties in her 
honor, 
authorizing her to receive his salaries and being seen around with her 
and 
behaving as if they were husband and wife are all manifestations of how 
respondent Judge acted towards Lourdes Garcia as seen in the eyes of the
 
complainants and their witnesses. 


âWhat more proof would one need to show an immoral relationship
 other than 
these straightforward statements of the complainants and their 
witnesses? Both 
respondent Judge and Lourdes Garcia admit being married to other persons
 but the 
way they behaved in front of the public is as if they were married to 
one 
another. 


âAgainst these positive testimonies is respondent Judgeâs 
denial. But it is 
axiomatic in the law of evidence that positive statements prevail over 
negative 
statements.


âA look at the denials of respondent Judge and his witnesses 
remain denials. 
Although they would attempt to explain that the presence of respondent 
Judge and 
Lourdes Garcia together on several occasions were due to circumstances 
or plain 
coincidences, it would appear to the Investigating Justice that these 
coincidences are one too many. 


âIn his Memorandum, respondent Judge questions the motives of 
the 
complainants and their witnesses stating that all of them had something 
against 
him and would lie through their teeth just to oust him out of his 
position. 


âRespondent Judge claims that the testimony of Atty. Omega 
Moises Lacandola 
is biased and fraught with exaggerations and distortions. He traces 
Atty. 
Lacandolaâs prejudice against him to the fact that she was getting back 
at him 
for his act of filing an administrative case against Judge Bienvenido R.
 
Estrada. 


âJudge Estrada was her Presiding Judge when she was a Branch 
Clerk of Court. 
Now that Atty. Lacandola is the Clerk of Court, Judge Estrada is the 
Executive 
Judge of the Regional Trial Court in San Carlos City. 


âRespondent Judge claims that as Judge Estrada and Atty. 
Lacandola have a 
very close working relationship, the latter would go to all lengths to 
destroy 
him (respondent Judge) including fabricating stories against him just 
because he 
filed an administrative case against Judge Estrada. 


âThis theory is too far-fetched to be believed. First, the case
 filed by 
respondent Judge against Judge Estrada came after this case had already 
been 
filed. If at all, it appears that respondent Judge in filing the case 
against 
Judge Estrada after this case was filed was the one who was trying to 
even the 
score between him and the latter. 


âSecond, the testimony of Atty. Lacandola does not appear to be
 improbable or 
impossible despite what respondent Judge believes. She testified on what
 she saw 
and observed and she may have been hostile and stubborn at times but 
this does 
not mean that she was making up a story. 


âAs far as the testimony of complainant Cynthia Marquez is 
concerned, 
respondent Judge in his Memorandum claims that it âwas polluted by hate,
 desire 
for revenge, and for personal gain.â 


âIt appears that respondent Judge filed an administrative case 
against her 
for dishonesty and falsification of daily time record in 1994 but he 
himself had 
it dismissed in 1995. Not only that. 


âRespondent Judge did not indorse Cynthia Marquez for the 
position of Legal 
Researcher of his court and instead recommended somebody else. Her 
displeasure 
at respondent Judgeâs actions and her desire to get back at him 
motivated 
Cynthia Marquez to weave an incredible story against him. 


âBut respondent Judgeâs conclusion seems to be illogical. Since
 respondent 
Judge himself had the case dismissed, why would Cynthia Marquez still be
 bent on 
getting back at him? 


âIn fact, it is respondent Judge himself who got back at 
Cynthia Marquez by 
filing another administrative case against her while this case was being
 heard. 
That case stemmed from the earlier case and this time respondent Judge 
was 
charging Cynthia Marquez with falsification of her personal data sheet 
and 
procuring her appointment as Interpreter under false pretenses. 



âAs far as her non-endorsement is concerned, the Investigating 
Justice 
believes that this is not sufficient ground to doubt the testimony of 
Cynthia 
Marquez. She gave her story replete with details and events that showed 
the 
immoral acts of respondent Judge. If her testimony were contrived, she 
would be 
one great storyteller. 


âRespondent Judge also states in his Memorandum that the reason
 why Atty. 
Leopoldo C. Tulagan testified against him is because said lawyer wanted 
his 
pound of flesh as he lost several cases in respondent Judgeâs court. 
This is 
incredible. Following this reasoning we will come to the conclusion that
 all 
lawyers who lost their cases before judges would readily testify against
 them at 
the expense of committing perjury. The Supreme Court would be clogged 
with 
administrative cases against judges filed by lawyers who take offense 
for the 
defeat of their cases. 


âAll told, respondent Judge attacks all the testimonies of the 
complainants 
and their witnesses as improbable and motivated by ill will and desire 
for 
revenge. He states that they could not have seen what they claim to have
 seen 
because it was impossible to see through a closed window, the parking 
spaces for 
jeeps was not located at a place where the Justice Hall or the City Hall
 could 
be seen, or that goats are not butchered nor fishes cleaned a day before
 
cooking. 


âBut if we look closely at what respondent Judge calls 
impossible stories, 
these are minor, even inconsequential details that do not detract from 
the truth 
of what the complainants and their witnesses saw and testified on. 



âNot contented with accusing complainants and their witnesses 
as telling 
improbable stories, respondent Judge states that all of them were 
prejudiced 
against him as they all had their respective reasons for wanting to get 
back at 
him. This encompassing conclusion is more imagined than real. Respondent
 Judge 
would like to portray that he is the victim of an âelaborate plot 
concocted by 
the complainants to get him out of office. But using as defense this 
âdelusion 
of persecutionâ is not enough to overthrow the persuasive and convincing
 
evidence mounted against respondent Judge. 


âRespondent Judge readily concludes the motives of complainants
 and their 
witnesses as suspect. But could not their motives also be the desire to 
tell the 
truth? Much as respondent Judge would like to portray them all as 
pathological 
liars, their âliesâ border more on the truth and appear to be more 
convincing 
than respondent Judgeâs bare-faced denials. 


âAs the Investigating Justice heard this case personally from 
the beginning 
to its conclusion, he has observed the demeanor of all those who swore 
to tell 
the truth and nothing but the whole truth. And while this oath may have 
appeared 
to be meaningless for some, it was clearly noticeable that the 
complainants and 
their witnesses were the ones who valued its meaning and honored their 
oath to 
tell the truth. 


âFrom the evidence presented, there can be no denying that 
indeed respondent 
Judge and Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia are maintaining an illicit relationship. 
The 
details of such relationship are clearly and unequivocally outlined by 
the 
complainants and their witnesses, who have nothing to gain by pitting 
themselves 
against a powerful figure. 


âMoreover, Lourdes Garcia admitted herself that she owes her 
present position 
to respondent Judge who helped her secure a permanent appointment at the
 City 
Legal Office in San Carlos City. Why would respondent Judge do that for 
her if 
according to both of them they were merely casual acquaintances? What 
motive 
would respondent Judge have in helping her get that position were it not
 for the 
fact that they had an intimate relationship? 


âAdmitting that he is estranged from his wife, respondent Judge
 himself has 
made possible the circumstances that could have led to his present 
situation. He 
may be a judge but he is still a man with the same feelings and urges as
 any 
other man. Lourdes Garcia is a married woman who appears to be also 
estranged 
from her husband as nowhere in her testimony can be seen what happened 
to her 
husband except for the testimony of her own mother who stated that she 
never saw 
her son-in-law for a long time now. 


âHence, we have here a man and a woman both living away from 
their respective 
spouses and being thrown together has brought out in them the 
fulfillment of 
their desires not to be alone. True it may be human nature to feel 
needed and 
not be alone but in this case the man happens to be a Judge. 


âA judge is expected to be above himself, to transcend basic 
human urges if 
it is in conflict with the responsibility he swore to uphold when he 
took his 
oath. 


âxxx xxx xxx 




âIn his Memorandum, respondent Judge states that he has been 
previously 
charged with Immorality by complainant Cynthia Marquez but she herself 
had it 
dismissed. Also, Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia had already been charged with 
immorality 
before the Civil Service Commission in 1998 but the charges were 
dismissed in 
1999. Citing the case of Felicisimo San Luis, et. al. vs. Court of 
Appeals, G.R. 
No. L-80160, June 26, 1989, respondent Judge now claims that the 
dismissal of 
the first case against him operated as a bar to this instant case 
because of res 
judicata and that he would be twice in jeopardy of being convicted of 
the same 
offense. 


âThe case cited by respondent Judge finds no application to his
 case. The 
fact that the previous charges were dismissed against both him and 
Lourdes 
Garcia should not be taken to mean that they have been exonerated 
entirely. 
Immorality is a continuing offense and the first charge should have at 
least 
warned him to mend his ways. But he failed to do so and now that there 
is 
another charge he labels it an act of persecution. Further, the 
complainants and 
their witnesses testified on acts of immorality of respondent Judge from
 1991 
until this present charge was filed in 1998. Angelito Dispo even went to
 the 
extent of stating that at the time he testified in this case on 
September 14, 
1999, respondent Judge and Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia were living together 
under one 
roof in Barangay Gabon, Calasiao, Pangasinan. 


âThus, granting that there was a previous charge of immorality 
in 1994 but 
was dismissed in 1995, this dismissal would only operate to absolve him 
of 
immoral acts until 1995. As this case was filed in 1998, it shows that 
despite 
the dismissal in 1995, respondent Judge continued his illicit relations 
with 
Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia for which he faces this present charge of 
Immorality. 



âxxx xxx xxx 




âRespondent Judge has shown that he is not worthy to don the 
robe of justice 
much less dispense justice when he himself transgresses the law which he
 has 
sworn to uphold. His blanket denial of the charges has not served to 
cause a 
dent in the positive evidence against him, neither has it portrayed him 
an 
innocent victim of malicious persecution, as he would want the 
Investigating 
Justice to believe. 


âAs the evidence presented definitely shows a lack of 
circumspection and 
delicadeza on the part of the respondent judge in displaying before the 
public 
his immoral relationship, the extreme penalty of dismissal is believed 
to be in 
order. 


âImmorality is a very serious charge that cannot be penalized 
by a mere fine 
or even suspension, as these light penalties would be tantamount to a 
tacit 
approval of the immoral act. 


âxxx xxx xxx 




âRespondent Judge has failed to live up to these exacting 
magnitude of how a 
judge should behave. His disregard for common decency and morality has 
made him 
unfit to discharge his present position âand thus his dismissal is in 
order. His 
retirement benefits should likewise be forfeited but his wife who has 
never 
appeared on the scene should now be his saving grace against such 
forfeiture. 



âIndeed it is the wife of Judge Llamas who is the aggrieved 
party in the 
infidelity of her husband but she was not the one who initiated this 
complaint 
nor did she participate in its prosecution. This factor should be 
considered in 
respondent Judgeâs favor and therefore he should be spared the 
forfeiture of his 
earned benefits.â
[4]
 [emphasis supplied] 



Justice Brawner thus recommended that respondent Judge be 
dismissed from 
service but without forfeiture of his earned benefits. 
In 
administrative 
proceedings, only substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant 
evidence 
that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,
 is 
required. We find no room to accommodate doubts on Justice Brawnerâs 
findings of 
facts, which we find to be a result of a meticulous and dispassionate 
analysis 
of the testimonies of the complainants and the respondent as well as 
their 
respective witnesses. Thus, we adopt Justice Brawnerâs recommendation of
 
dismissal. 


The Code of Judicial Conduct mandates that a judge should be 
the embodiment 
of competence, integrity, and independence.
[5]
 He should so behave at all times as 
to 
promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the 
judiciary,
[6]
 and 
avoid impropriety and 
the appearance of impropriety in all activities.
[7]
 His personal behavior, not only 
while in 
the performance of official duties but also outside the court, must be 
beyond 
reproach, for he is, as he so aptly is perceived to be, the visible 
personification of law and of justice.
[8]




Regrettably, respondent Judge failed to live up to these 
standards. He 
brazenly flouted judicial ethics and betrayed judicial standards by 
using âhis 
court to indulge his drinking, singing and dancing habits to the 
detriment of 
the other courts within the building who were disturbed by all the noise
 coming 
from his courtroomâ; and, especially, by maintaining an illicit 
relationship 
with Lourdes MuÃ±oz Garcia, a married woman. A judge suffers from moral 
obtuseness or has a weird notion of morality in public office when he 
labors 
under the delusion that he can be a judge and at the same time have a 
mistress 
in defiance of the mores and sense of morality of the community.
[9]
 


A judge traces a line around his official as well as personal 
conduct, a 
price one has to pay for occupying an exalted position in the judiciary,
 beyond 
which he may not freely venture.
[10]
 No 
position is more demanding as regards moral righteousness and 
uprightness of any 
individual than a seat on the Bench.
[11]
 
Thus, a judge ought to live up to the strictest standard of honesty, 
integrity 
and uprightness. Certainly, keeping a mistress is not an act one would 
expect of 
a judge who is expected to posses the highest standard of morality and 
decency.
[12]




Respondent Judge shamelessly mocked the dignity of his office 
and tainted the 
image of the entire judiciary to which he owes fealty and the obligation
 to keep 
it at all time unsullied and worthy of the peopleâs trust. Respondent 
Judge has 
shown himself unworthy of the judicial robe and the place of honor 
reserved for 
the guardian of justice in a civilized community. On this occasion, 
therefore, 
the Court metes upon respondent Judge the severest of administrative 
penalties. 
He is hereby stripped of his judicial robe. 


However, we are unable to agree with the reservation of Justice
 Brawner on 
the forfeiture of earned benefits due respondent Judge based on the fact
 that 
respondent Judgeâs wife was not the one who initiated this complaint nor
 did she 
participate in its prosecution. The non-participation or non-appearance 
of the 
wife in the administrative proceedings for immorality is not a factor in
 the 
imposition of penalty. Neither should it be beneficial to respondent 
Judge. 


Under Section 8 of A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC amending Rule 140 of the
 Rules of 
Court on the Discipline of Justices and Judges, which took effect on 
October 1, 
2001, gross misconduct and immorality are classified as serious charges,
 each of 
which carry with it a penalty of either (a) dismissal from the service, 
forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, 
and 
disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office,
 
including government-owned or controlled corporations. Provided, 
however, that 
the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave 
credits; (b) 
suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than 
three (3) 
but not exceeding six (6) months; or (c) a fine of more than P20,000.00 
but not 
exceeding P40,000.00. 


In 
Carina Agarao vs. Judge Jose J. Parentela, 
Jr.
, 
[13]
 we dismissed respondent judge on ground 
of immorality and we ordered the forfeiture of one-half of all the 
retirement 
benefits of respondent Judge, excluding the monthly equivalent of his 
accrued 
leave credits. 


WHEREFORE, 
finding respondent 
Judge Victor T. Llamas, Jr. 
guilty of the charge of immorality, he is hereby DISMISSED from the 
service with 
forfeiture of 50% of all his retirement benefits excluding any earned 
leave 
credits; and, with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or agency of
 the 
government, including government-owned and controlled corporations.
