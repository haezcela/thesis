[ G.R. No. 143136-37, July 11, 2002 ]


SAN MIGUEL CORPORATION, PETITIONER,
VS. ALFREDO B. LAO, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




VITUG, J.:


Petitioner
assails in the instant petition, the decision and the resolution, dated 31
January 2000 and the 14 April 2000, respectively, of the Court of Appeals,
affirming the judgment of the National Labor Relations Commission (âNLRCâ)
which has awarded retirements benefits to respondent under âthe companyâs
retirement plan if any or, if none, separation pay at the rate of one half
(1/2) month salary for every year of service.â


The factual
antecedents were synthesized by the Court of Appeals in its decision.


âAs borne out by the records, the
following facts given credence by the labor arbiter reveal that Alfredo B. Lao
had worked as Materials Planner for San Miguel Corporation, Inc. (SMC for
brevity) whose responsibility includes procurement of cullets (âbubogâ), raw
materials used by the company for its glass plant. On December 10, 1995,
Rogerio Ibanes, Security Detachment Commander of the Sentinel Watchman and
Protective Agency, received information that some deliveries of cullets were
being misdeclared. Acting on this tip, Mr. Ibanes conducted surveillance work
on deliveries of cullets made by Four Sisters, the Companyâs biggest supplier
of cullets. Mr. Ibanes and Larry Ventura, a store staff of the company,
personally witnessed the attempt by the employees of Four Sisters to divert
three (3) truck loads of unwashed cullets earlier delivered to the company but
were backloaded and brought to Marilao, Bulacan for washing purposes.


âOn January 19, 1996, Mr. Ibanes
recounted that at about 9:30 oâclock in the evening, three (3) trucks owned by
Four Sisters and loaded with cullets, arrived at the SMCâs Manila Glass Plant
in Binondo, Manila. Covered by corresponding delivery receipts, these cullets
after being weighed were sent off to Marilao, Bulacan for washing purposes.
However, these cullets were brought to Cabuyao, Laguna which prodded Mr. Ibanes
to report the matter to the Cabuyao Police who immediately apprehended the
delivery truck drivers as they neared the plant of Asia Brewery located in that
area. While the drivers were undergoing investigation at the Cabuyao Police
Station, Alfredo B. Lao and Henry Ordinanza, owner of Four Sisters Bottle
dealer arrived. Upon their arrival, Alfredo Lao confronted Ibanes and asked him
what made him apprehend the cullets belonging to Mr. Ordinanza. Ibanes
immediately answered that the cullet delivery is slated at Marilao, Bulacan for
washing purposes but to his surprise, it went to Cabuyao, Laguna.


âUpon intercession of Alfredo Lao,
the three trucks and its drivers and crew were released from the police custody
the next day.


âIn the administrative
investigation that ensued, SMC required Alfredo B. Lao to submit a written
explanation why he interceded for the release of the drivers, helpers and the
three (3) truck loads of unwashed cullets from police custody.


âFinding unsatisfactory the
explanation given by Lao, he was terminated (sic) by SMC on May 15, 1996, for
violation of the rule prohibiting âremoval of any company property without
proper authorization.ââ
[1]


Aggrieved,
respondent Alfredo B. Lao filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. In the
proceedings below, Lao admitted that he did intercede for the release of the
cullets to Mr. Henry Ordinanza but, he said, only after having been assured by
the latter that he (Ordinanza) would personally take the matter up with
petitioner San Miguel Corporation (SMC) the next business day. Lao claimed that
the company did not incur any loss because of his action considering that the
cullets did not as yet belong to SMC and the supplier of the cullets still
retained control and possession of the items. SMC belittled the contention and
argued that when Lao made strong representations, under cloak of authority, to
the Cabuyao Police that the cullets belonged to Ordinanza and were intended for
delivery to a rival firm, he committed an act of disloyalty and willful breach
of trust.


The labor
arbiter dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal and ruled that Lao
deviated from his responsibility to ensure adequate inventory and supply of
cullets to the glass plant of SMC. The labor arbiter concluded that the act of
Lao in causing the delivery of the cullets into the hands of a competitor was
an act of disloyalty that justified the termination of his employment. On
appeal to it, the NLRC, in its resolution of 05 June 1998, affirmed the
decision of the labor arbiter but, taking into account his track record of
twenty-seven (27) years of employment and the fact that it was the first time
that he had committed an act adverse to SMC, the commission ordered the latter
to pay Lao his retirement benefits under its retirement plan if any, or, if
none, to pay him separation pay at the rate of one-half (1/2) month salary for
every year of service. Dissatisfied, SMC appealed the decision to the Court of
Appeals. The appellate court, in its now assailed decision and resolution,
dismissed the petition and affirmed the ruling of the NLRC.


The Court of
Appeals debunked SMCâs argument that the directive to pay respondent retirement
benefits could not be legally carried out because of the provision in the
retirement plan prohibiting the award of retirement benefits to any member
dismissed for cause attributable to his own fault, negligence, misconduct or
fraud. Relying on the case of 
Razon, Jr. vs. NLRC,
[2]
 
the
appellate court held that management discretion with regard to the
implementation of the retirement plan could not be exercised arbitrarily or
capriciously on the premise that, upon acceptance of employment, a contractual
relationship was established that gave employees an enforceable vested interest
in the retirement fund.


In its petition,
SMC argues that the offense committed by Lao constitutes serious misconduct and
an act of betrayal against his employer, and he does not deserve to be rewarded
with an immense and sizable financial benefit after his culpability has been
established in two decisions of competent labor tribunals. If it were to be
held otherwise, even in the name of compassion, it would be, SMC submits, to
send a wrong signal that one can unjustly derive benefit at the expense of
another in the name of social justice. In his comment, Lao has stressed that
the Court of Appeals did not commit serious error by ordering payment of
retirement benefits in his favor on the basis of social and compassionate
justice as so ruled in a number of cases.


The central
issue before the Court thus focuses on the propriety of the award of either
retirement benefits or separation pay to Alfredo B. Lao.


To begin with,
the award of separation pay is authorized in the situations dealt with in
Article 283
[3]
 and
Article 284
[4]
 of the
Labor Code and in cases where there is illegal dismissal but reinstatement
would no longer be feasible under Section 4(b), Rule I, Book VI, of the
Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code.
[5]
 When an
employee is dismissed for any of the 
just causes
 enumerated in Article
282 of the Labor Code, the rule is that he would not be entitled to the payment
of separation pay. Article 282 of the Labor Code reads:


"Art
. 
282. Termination
by employer - An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following
causes:


âa.
  
 
Serious
misconduct
 or 
willful disobedience
 by the employee of the lawful
orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work;


âb.  
Gross
and habitual neglect
 by the employee of his duties;


âc.
  
 Fraud or 
willful
breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly
authorized representative
;


âd. 
Commission of a crime or offense by the
employee against the person of his employer or any immediate member of his
family or his duly authorized representative
; and


âe.  
Other causes analogous to the foregoing
.â


Section 7, Rule I, Book VI, of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor
Code, similarly provides:


âSec. 7- Termination of employment
by employer. - The just causes for terminating the services of an employee
shall be those provided in Article 282 of the Code. The separation from work of
an employee for a just cause does not entitle him to the termination pay
provided in the Code, without prejudice, however, to whatever rights, benefits
and privileges he may have under the applicable individual or collective bargaining
agreement with the employer or voluntary employer policy or practice.â


Exceptionally,
however, separation pay is granted to stand as a âmeasure of social justiceâ
even when the employee is validly dismissed for cause so long as it is not for
serious misconduct or those other causes that reflect on his moral character.


In 
Soco vs.
Mercantile Corporation of Davao,
[6]
 
separation
pay was granted to an employee who had been dismissed for using the company
vehicle for a private purpose. In 
Tanala vs. National Labor Relations
Commission
[7]
 
the
payment of separation pay to an employee who had been dismissed for quarreling
with a fellow worker outside the company premises was sustained. Likewise, in 
Filipro,
Inc. vs. NLRC,
[8]
 
an award
of separation pay was decreed in favor of an employee who had been validly
dismissed for preferring certain dealers in violation of company policy. The
Court, however, disallowed the grant of separation pay to employees dismissed
for serious misconduct or for some other causes reflecting on his moral
character.
[9]
 
In the
case of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT) vs. NLRC and Abucay,
[10]
 
the Court
clarified a perceived incongruence in its several pronouncements by stating
thusly:


âWe hold that
 henceforth
separation pay shall be allowed as a measure of social justice only in those
instances where the employee is validly dismissed for causes other than serious
misconduct or those reflecting on his moral character. 
Where the reason for
the valid dismissal is, for example, habitual intoxication or an offense
involving moral turpitude, like theft or illicit sexual relations with a fellow
worker, the employer may not be required to give the dismissed employee
separation pay, or financial assistance, or whatever other name it is called,
on the ground of social justice.


âx x x
                                        
x
x x
                                  
x x x


â
The policy of social justice is
not intended to countenance wrongdoing simply because it is committed by the
underprivileged
. At best it may mitigate the penalty but it certainly will
not condone the offense.â
[11]


The 
dictum 
was followed in 
Philippine National Construction
Corporation vs. NLRC,
[12]
 
where the
Court deleted an award of separation pay to an employee who had been found
guilty of dishonesty for having stolen company property. 
Cosmopolitan
Funeral Homes, Inc., vs. Maalat
[13]
 
disallowed
the grant of separation pay to an employee who was dismissed for dishonesty for
an understatement of reported contract price against the actual contract price
charged to and paid by the customers and for misappropriation of funds or
collections. A similar holding was reached in 
Zenco Sales, Inc., vs. NLRC,
[14]
 
where the
dismissed employee was found guilty of gross misconduct for having used his
employerâs property, equipment and personnel in his personal business. The
Court reversed the decision of the NLRC in 
San Miguel Corporation vs. NLRC,
[15]
 
granting
an employee, dismissed for dishonesty, the privilege to retire from the company
with a right to avail himself of 100% of the benefits the company had offered
to retiring employees. Quite recently, in 
Edge Apparel, inc. vs. NLRC,
[16]
 
the Court,
categorizing the two causes for the dismissal of an employee - âjust causesâ
under Article 282 of the Labor Code and âauthorized causesâ under Article 283
and 284 of the same code -reiterated that an employee whose employment was
terminated for a just cause would not be so entitled as a matter of right to
the payment of separation benefits.


While it would
be compassionate to give separation pay to a salesman if he were dismissed for
his inability to fill his quota, surely, however, he does not deserve such
generosity if his offense is the misappropriation of the receipts of his sales.
[17]
 Where the
cause for the termination of employment cannot be considered as one of mere
inefficiency or incompetence but an act that constitutes an utter disregard for
the interest of the employer or a palpable breach of trust reposed in him, the
grant by the Court of separation benefits is hardly justifiable.


In the case at
bar, respondent is found by the labor arbiter and the NLRC to have been
properly dismissed for his willful breach of trust and confidence. These
findings, which have been affirmed by the Court of Appeals, cannot simply be
ignored; indeed, such findings possess a degree of conclusiveness on, or at the
very least must be accorded respect by, this Court.
[18]


Unfortunately
for respondent, neither can he claim benefits due from the employer under the
companyâs retirement plan which concededly prohibits the award of retirement
benefits to an employee dismissed for a just cause, a proscription that binds
the parties to it. The appellate courtâs reliance on 
Razon, Jr. vs. NLRC
[19]
 
is
misplaced. In 
Razon, 
the employerâs refusal to give the employee his
retirement benefits is based on the provision of the retirement plan giving
management wide discretion to grant or not to grant retirement benefits, a
prerogative that obviously cannot be exercised arbitrarily or whimsically.


The Court,
nevertheless, understands and shares the plight of respondent who has spent the
best years of his useful life with petitioner. The Court commiserates with him
but it can do no more than to appeal to an act of compassion by SMC and to ask
it to see its way clear to affording some form of financial assistance to
respondent who has served it for almost three decades with no previous
blemished record.


WHEREFORE
, the petition is GRANTED, and the
assailed decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals insofar as it decrees
the payment of retirement benefits or separation pay to respondent Lao, affirming
that of the National Labor Relations Commission, is hereby REVERSED and SET
ASIDE. It is hoped, however, that petitioner will heed the Courtâs call for
compassion. No costs.

ART. 283. Closure of establishment and reduction of
personnel. - The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due
to the installation of labor saving devices, redundancy, retrenchment to
prevent losses or the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or
undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the

of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the intended date
thereof. In case of termination due to the installation of labor saving devices
or redundancy, the worker affected thereby shall be entitled to a separation
pay equivalent to at least his one (1)month pay or to at least one (1) month
pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. In case of retrenchment to
prevent losses and in cases of closures or cessation of operations of
establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial
reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or to at
least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.
A fraction of at least six(6) months shall be considered one (1)
 
whole
year.






[4]
 
ART. 284. Disease as ground for termination. - An

Provided, That he is paid separation pay equivalent to at least one (1) month
salary or to one-half month salary for every year of service, whichever is
greater, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one (1)
whole year.

operations or where his former position no longer exists at the time of
reinstatement for reasons not attributable to the fault of the employer, the
employee shall be entitled to separation pay equivalent at least to one month
salary or to one month salary for every year of service, whichever is higher, a
fraction of at least six months being considered as one whole year.
