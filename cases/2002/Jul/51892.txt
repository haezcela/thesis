[4]
 


When arraigned, the accused, assisted by counsel, pled ânot 
guiltyâ to all 
the charges.
[5]
 
Trial ensued.


The prosecution presented as its sole witness the private 
complainant, Lea 
Arevalo.


At the time the rapes were committed in May 1997, the private 
complainant was 
thirteen (13) years old.
[6]
 She was born 
on January 11, 1984, as evidenced by the certification issued by the 
Office of 
the Local Civil Registrar of Tarlac.
[7]
 
The accused is an older brother of her mother, Teresita Arevalo. She was
 then 
residing with her aunt, Cristina Mase, sister of her mother and of the 
accused, 
at Barangay Langgam, San Pedro, Laguna.
[8]
 


The accused was residing in the same 
barangay, 

but in another house 
quite far from the house of his sister Cristina. He has two children 
with his 
estranged wife, but they were not living with him.
[9]
 


In May 1997, the house of Cristina Mase was under construction.
 The room 
where the private complainant used to sleep had no door panel. Cristina 
would 
sleep in the 
sala
 and her son and daughter-in-law, 
in the other room. 
The house had three doors: the main door in front, the second, at the 
side, and 
the third, at the back. The backdoor did not have a door panel 
then.
[10]




The private complainant recalled that the first rape took place
 in the first 
week of May 1997, at nighttime. She testified that at about 10:00 p.m, 
she went 
to bed. The accused entered her room and woke her up. He covered her 
mouth with 
his left hand and poked a knife at her. He dragged her out of the house 
and 
brought her to his house. She went with him because she feared he would 
maul her 
just like what he used to do to his children.
[11]
 


Upon reaching his house, the accused closed the door and led 
the private 
complainant to his room. He made her lie down on a bed. When he removed 
her 
clothes, she fought back by kicking and striking him with her 
hands.
[12]




The accused ordered her not to shout. Afraid that he would hurt
 her, she 
obeyed.
[13]
 After 
removing her clothes, 
he disrobed himself. He mounted her and had sexual intercourse with her.
 During 
the sexual assault, he held her hands but she managed to kick his legs. 
He 
stayed on top of her for about twenty (20) minutes. Thereafter, he told 
her to 
put on her clothes. He let her walk back to her auntâs house 
alone.
[14]




The next incident occurred the following week. The accused 
barged in his 
sisterâs house at nighttime while the private complainant and her 
companions 
were sleeping. He woke up the private complainant. His eyes were red and
 he 
smelled of liquor. Again, he poked a knife at her and brought her to his
 house. 
She pleaded with him not to rape her again. He ignored her. Once inside 
his 
house, the accused took her to his room. He tried to remove her clothes 
but she 
warded off his hands. Her efforts were futile. He succeeded in taking 
off her 
sando and T-shirt as well as her shorts and panty. Next, he undressed 
and made 
her lie down on the same bed where he first abused her. He went on top 
of her 
and had carnal knowledge of her. She felt pain when he went inside her. 
He was 
on top of her for about twenty (20) minutes. After the rape, he 
instructed her 
to get dressed.
[15]
 He warned her not to 
report the incident to her mother because he could get incarcerated. 
Again, she 
went home alone.
[16]
 


The private complainant kept silent about the two (2) rape 
incidents because 
the accused threatened he would kill her mother.
[17]
 After each rape, she returned to 
her room 
and went back to sleep as her companions in the house were still 
asleep.
[18]




About one and one-half weeks after the second rape, the private
 complainant 
was again roused from her sleep when the accused suddenly covered her 
mouth with 
his hand. He ordered her not to shout. He seemed inebriated. He poked a 
knife at 
her and, as in the previous occasions, he dragged her toward his house. 
Once 
they were in his room, he undressed her and himself, mounted her and had
 sexual 
intercourse with her. He stayed on top of her for twenty (20) minutes. 
Thereafter, he instructed her to go home and she did. Again, he 
threatened her 
not to report the incident to her mother. Unknown to her, the 17-year 
old son of 
the accused, Meliton Abala, saw her in the house of the accused.
[19]
 


The last rape was committed on May 31, 1997. Again, the accused
 entered the 
room of the private complainant when she and her companions in the house
 were in 
deep slumber. He poked a knife at her neck. He told her to be quiet, 
covered her 
mouth with his left hand and dragged her out of the house through the 
backdoor 
and brought her to his house.
[20]
 


When they were inside the room, the accused told her to sit 
down on his bed. 
She kicked him and tried to escape. Her attempts were unsuccessful 
because he 
was poking a knife at her. While pulling down her shorts and panty, he 
warned 
her not to reveal the incident to anyone. He did not remove her T-shirt.
 
Instead, he completely disrobed himself. He forcibly made her lie down 
on the 
bed and went on top of her. She struggled but he held her hands. 
Overpowered, he 
succeeded in his evil desire. As he thrust his private part into hers, 
she cried 
and pleaded with him to stop. He did not listen. He was on top of her 
for a long 
time. After his lust was satisfied, he told her to go home.
[21]
 


After the fourth rape, Cristina confronted the private 
complainant with the 
report she got from Meliton Abala that he saw the private complainant in
 the 
house of the accused on the night she was abused for the third time. 
Cristina 
asked her what she was doing there at such a late hour of the night. She
 did not 
reply. She was afraid of the accused because of his threats that he 
would kill 
her mother.
[22]




Eventually, the report reached the private complainantâs 
mother, Teresita 
Arevalo, through the private complainantâs first cousin, Marites. 
Apparently, 
Cristina informed Marites what had happened to the private complainant 
and the 
latter relayed it to Teresita. When Teresita confronted the private 
complainant 
if her Ate Marites was telling the truth, she finally confessed to her 
mother 
that she was molested by the accused. Her mother was furious and she 
helped her 
lodge the four (4) complaints for rape against the accused.
[23]
 


On June 7, 1997, the private complainant underwent a medical 
examination at 
the National Bureau of Investigation in Manila. The examining doctor, 
Medico-Legal Officer Valentin T. Bernales, found a âdeep healed 
lacerationâ on 
private complainantâs hymen âat 4:00 oâclock and completed at 6:00 
oâclock 
position, corresponding to the face of the watch.â
[24]
 


The sole witness for the defense was the accused.


The accused interposed the defense of denial and alibi. He 
claimed that his 
son, Meliton Abala, and daughter, Gladys Abala, 15 years old, were 
living with 
him in his house at 
Barangay
 Langgam, San Pedro, 
Laguna. His wife, Ma. 
Elena Moran, stayed some place else and would just pay him a visit once 
in a 
while. His other companions in the house were his brother, Dominador 
Abala, and 
his wife and their children. They occupied the other half of the 
house.


His story was that he did not see the private complainant the 
whole month of 
May 1997. He did not know why the private complainant accused him of 
violating 
her on several occasions. He surmised that she filed the cases because 
he and 
his brother, Dominador, had a feud over their house. The house belonged 
to their 
late mother. Allegedly, he wanted to sell the house to buy a tricycle, 
but his 
siblings, namely, Lydia, Cristina, Teresita and Dominador were against 
his 
plan.


In its Decision, dated August 19, 1998, the trial court found 
the accused 
guilty of four (4) counts of rape. For each rape committed, he was 
sentenced to 
suffer the death penalty and ordered to pay the private complainant the 
sums of 
P100,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages, and to 
pay the 
costs.
[25]




The cases are with us on automatic review.


The appellant raises the following assignment of errors:
[26]
 


âI




THE TRIAL COURT MANIFESTLY ERRED IN RENDERING A VERDICT OF 
CONVICTION IN 
CRIMINAL CASE NOS. 0709 TO 0712 DESPITE (THE) FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION
 TO 
PROVE (THE) ACCUSED-APPELLANTâS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.


II


THE TRIAL COURT MANIFESTLY ERRED IN CONVICTING (THE) 
ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF 
FOUR (4) COUNTS OF RAPE IN CRIMINAL CASE NOS. 0709 TO 0712 
NOTWITHSTANDING THE 
FACT THAT THE SPECIAL QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANTâS 
RELATIONSHIP TO THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT WAS NOT ALLEGED IN THE SUBJECT 
INFORMATIONS THEREBY VIOLATING HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS 
AND TO 
BE INFORMED OF THE NATURE AND THE CAUSE OF THE ACCUSATION AGAINST 
HIM.â


We affirm the convictions but with modifications as to the 
penalties 
imposed.


The first assigned error boils down to the alleged lack of 
credibility of the 
private complainant. He cites several reasons why the Court should 
reject her 
story, to wit:


First. The appellant claims that he could not have dragged her 
out of her 
auntâs house four (4) times without being noticed by its occupants. The 
private 
complainant could also shout to attract the attention of the residents 
in the 
vicinity. He also points out that he could not have brought her to his 
house and 
raped her because his children were living with him.


Second. The appellant claims that he would have been 
discouraged from going 
to where the private complainant stayed on those four (4) occasions 
considering 
that there was a light coming from outside the house, near the room of 
the 
private complainant.


Third. It is not credible that he used the same method in 
taking the private 
complainant from her auntâs house, bring her to his house and rape her 
there 
because in doing so, he could have been easily identified. It is also 
doubtful 
that he used the same knife in forcing her to go with him to his 
house.


Fourth. The private complainant gave a âtailor-fitâ answer 
regarding his 
physical condition during the second and third incidents, i.e., his eyes
 were 
red and he smelled of liquor.


Fifth. It is also incredible for him to spend the same length 
of time, about 
(20) minutes, in raping the private complainant on all the four (4) 
occasions.


The first assigned error lacks merit.


We find no reason to doubt the credibility of the private 
complainant. We 
quote with approval the following observations of the trial court as 
regards her 
credibility, thus:




âConsidering the evidence on hand, the Court finds that the 
prosecution has 
fully established and proven that herein accused had sexually abused his
 own 
niece, 13-year old private complainant Lea, not only on one, but (also) 
on four 
(4) occasions in May 1997. Leaâs â¦ positive identification of (the) 
accused as 
the one who ravished her bespeaks of her spontaneity and veracity. 
Moreover, her 
answers to questions propounded to her during the trial on the identity 
of (the) 
accused were straightforward and coherent which simply strengthen her 
credibility. As oftentimes stated by the Supreme Court in rape cases, it
 is 
difficult to believe that young unmarried women would tell a story of 
defloration, allow the examination of their private parts and 
thereafter, permit 
themselves to be the subject of a public trial, if they were not 
instigated by 
an honest desire to seek justiceâ¦. In the case at bar, it is really hard
 to 
conceive that a young and immature girl would reveal that she was raped 
and 
allow an embarrassing examination of her private part if her motive is 
not to 
bring to justice her uncle who had done her wrong. In fact, no young and
 decent 
Filipina would publicly admit that she was ravished and her honor 
tainted unless 
such was true, for it would be instinctive for her to protect her 
honorâ¦. The 
mere fact that the accused wanted to sell the house owned by his late 
mother 
while his sisters and brother had made their protests is not sufficient 
motive 
for Lea to take (sic) a false imputation against her own uncle and 
charge him 
with the serious crime of rape. Admittedly, there was no sign of any 
physical 
injury noted on Leaâs body at the time of her examination, but it does 
not 
necessarily mean that the element of force which is essential to the 
crime of 
rape is lacking. While physical resistance need not be established in 
rape when 
threats and intimidation are employed and the victim submits herself to 
her 
rapist against her will because of fear for life and personal safety, 
still it 
is important to note that Lea clearly testified that she yielded to the 
carnal 
desires of her uncle accused for fear that he might kill or injure her 
since he 
was poking a knife at her on those 4 occasions. Despite the presence of 
the 
knife, she still managed to put up even a mild fight by kicking (the) 
accused 
and striking him with her bare hands thereby showing tenacity or vigor 
in her 
resistance. Moreover, the assertion of authority and moral ascendancy of
 the 
accused over Lea is already sufficient intimidation. In fact, when (the)
 accused 
warned her not to tell her mother about what he had done to her or else 
her 
mother (would) be killed, she followed him. On the other hand, the 
accusation of 
Lea was reinforced by the medical certificate entitled Living Case No. 
MG-97-812 
(Exhibit E) of NBI Medico-Legal Officer Valentin Bernales who found a 
healed 
laceration on her hymen.â
[27]




The records support the foregoing findings of the trial court. 
The private 
complainantâs accounts of the rape incidents were straightforward, clear
 and 
concise, indicating that she was telling the truth when she testified in
 court. 
She recalled the first incident as follows:
[28]

As regards the May 31, 1997 rape incident, the private 
complainant testified 
as follows:
[31]




âPROS. LOMARDA:


Q: Upon (your) arrived (sic) at the house of your uncle you 
were brought to 
one of his room(s), what happened inside the room?
A: He asked 
me to sit down 
on the bed and I tried to fight back, sir.


Q: How did you put up a fight back (sic) with your Uncle 
Tony?
A: I kicked 
him, sir.


Q: Aside from kicking your Uncle Tony, what else did you do if 
you did 
anything?
A: I am (sic) trying to escape, sir.


Q: While you were kicking and trying to escape from your Uncle 
Tony, where 
was the knife that you said he was holding?
A: He was still 
holding it, 
sir.


Q: After kicking and you said you are trying to escape from 
him, what else 
happened?
A: I was not able to escape and he continued poking 
the knife at 
me, sir.


Q: And what did he do when he poked the knife at 
you?
A: He told me not to 
report and while he was saying that he was pulling my dress, 
sir.


Q: To which direction did he pull your dress?
A: He is
 pulling down my 
short(s), sir.


Q: Was he able to pull down your short(s)?
A: Yes, 
sir.


Q: Were you wearing panty at that time?
A: Yes, 
sir.


Q: What did he do with you?
A: The panty was pulled 
down together with my 
short(s), sir.


Q: What were you wearing on the waist up?
A: T-shirt, 
sir.


Q: What happened to that t-shirt?
A: It was not 
removed, sir.


Q: After your short(s) was pulled down, what did he do if he 
did 
anything?
A: He removed his clothes, sir.


x x x x x x x x x


Q: When he was already naked, what did he do if he did 
anything?
A: He 
forcibly caused me to lie (down), sir.


Q: And what did he do when you were lying on the 
bed?
A: He put himself on 
top of me, sir.


Q: What happened next?
A: I was struggling but he held
 my hands, sir.


Q: What happened next?
A: He forcibly inserted his 
penis to my vagina, 
sir.


Q: Was he able to insert his penis to your vagina?
A: 
Yes, sir.


Q: While at that time when he inserted his penis to your 
private part, what 
did you do?
A: I was crying and I told him not to do that to 
me, sir.


Q: Did he listen to you?
A: No, sir.


Q: How long did he remain on top of you?
A: Long time 
sir.


Q: After that what happened?
A: After that he told me 
to go home, 
sir.â


There was nothing unusual with the fact that the appellant 
followed the same 
method in molesting the private complainant. Repeatedly, he waited until
 the 
private complainant and her companions in the house had gone to bed 
before he 
would surreptitiously enter her room. He avoided the 

sala
 where his 
sister, Cristina Mase, was sleeping, by exiting through the backdoor. He
 would 
then poke a knife at her and drag her to his house where he would 
eventually 
satisfy his lust. The scheme worked for him perfectly. It was not, 
therefore, 
strange that the appellant did not vary his strategy in raping the 
private 
complainant.


The fact that the private complainant did not shout to attract 
attention 
while she was being taken forcibly from her auntâs house did not make 
her less 
credible. It must be noted that when she was roused from her sleep, the 
appellant immediately covered her mouth with his hand, thus preventing 
her from 
calling for help. She was also threatened with a knife poked at her 
neck. We 
also consider that, at that time, she was only thirteen (13) years old, 
her 
height was no more than 143 cms. and her weight was merely 79 
lbs.
[32]
 It could 
hardly be expected that such a 
frail girl would put up a prolonged fight against the obviously stronger
 and 
armed appellant. Moreover, the appellant exercised moral ascendancy over
 the 
private complainant.
[33]
 


We reject the appellantâs allegation that it was impossible for
 him to commit 
the rapes in his house because his children were staying with him. Lust 
is not a 
respecter of place or time.
[34]
 It has 
been committed inside a room in a thickly populated area during a 
wake.
[35]
 It has 
been committed in a room adjacent 
to where other members of the family stay or in a room which the victim 
shared 
with others.
[36]




The appellant further questions the behavior of the private 
complainant after 
the rapesâshe put on her clothes without protestation, headed back home 
alone 
and slept as if nothing unusual had happened to her. It is also 
contended that 
she did not report the sexual abuses to the authorities.


We are not persuaded. It is well established that the appellant
 had instilled 
fear upon the private complainantâs young mind during the sexual 
assaults. He 
threatened to kill her mother if she would report the incidents to 
anyone. She 
was seized by fear even as she was allowed to go home by the appellant. 
The 
private complainant satisfactorily explained her silence, thus:
[37]
 




â(PROS. LOMARDA):


Q: The first and the second incident, did you not report this 
to anybody in 
your family?
A: No, sir.


Q: Could you give us the reason why you failed to report these 
first and 
second incidents?
A: I was afraid, sir.


Q: Afraid of whom?
A: Of my Uncle Tony, sir.


COURT:


Q: Why?
A: Because he told me that if I report to my 
mother, he will kill 
my mother, Maâam.


PROS. LOMARDA:


Q: When did he utter this threat, during the first or the 
second 
incident?
A: Both, sir.


Q: After each sexual intercourse or before each sexual 
intercourse?
A: 
After, sir.â


His threats
[38]
 continued to cow her 
to silence even after the fourth incident.
[39]
 She would have kept her ordeals in 
secret, except that her mother learned of the incidents from other 
sources. She 
testified as follows:
[40]
 


âPROS. LOMARDA:


Q: How long after the third incident did your Auntie Cristina 
confront you 
about the incident?
A: She asked me after the fourth incident, 
sir.


COURT:


Q: Why did you not tell your Auntie Cristina about the incident
 when she 
asked you?
A: I was afraid, maâam.


Q: Afraid of whom?
A: My Uncle Tony, maâam.


Q: Why were you afraid?
A: Because of his threat to 
kill my mother, 
maâam.


Q: What prompted you to lodge this complaint against your Uncle
 Tony?
A: 
When my mother learned about the incident from my Ate Marites, my mother
 
immediately brought me to the barangay hall, 
maâam.â


The appellant furthermore claims that the private complainant 
charged him 
with four (4) counts of rape because of an alleged quarrel between him 
and his 
siblings concerning his plan to sell the house of their late mother. The
 claim 
deserves little attention. The private complainant had nothing to do 
with the 
said feud and it is inconceivable that her mother would subject her to 
the 
humiliation, not to mention the inconvenience, trauma and scandal of a 
public 
trial had not her intention been to bring the appellant to justice. We 
repeat 
that it is highly unnatural for a parent to use her own offspring as an 
engine 
of malice, especially if it will further expose her to shame and 
dishonor.
[41]




In sum, we hold that the prosecution has established beyond 
reasonable doubt 
that the appellant had carnal knowledge of the private complainant on 
those four 
(4) occasions, against her will, through force and 
intimidation.


The appellant assails the Informations in Criminal Case Nos. 
0710-SPL to 
0712-SPL which merely alleged that the rapes were committed âsometime in
 May 
1997.â He claims it was unfair that, during the trial, the private 
complainant 
was allowed to testify that the first three (3) rapes occurred on the 
first 
week, the second week and sometime in the fourth week of May 1997. The 
appellant 
invokes our ruling in U.S. vs. Dichao (27 Phil. 422) and insists that 
the 
âprivate complainantâs failure to recall the exact dates of the subject 
incidents penetrates deeply into the core of her credibility.â
[42]
 


The failure to allege in the Informations the exact dates when 
the rapes were 
committed is not fatal. In rape cases, the exact dates are not material 
elements 
of the offense. Nor can the appellant claim that he was prejudiced by 
the 
testimony of the private complainant. His counsel extensively 
cross-examined the 
private complainant on the dates she was abused by the appellant. 
Besides, the 
defense of the appellant is a general denial that he never encountered 
the 
private complainant in the whole month of May 1997.


The appellantâs reliance in 
US vs. 
Dichao
 is misplaced 
because the information therein was insufficient on its face for being 
vague 
because it merely charged that the rape was committed âon or about and 
during 
the interval between October, 1910, to August, 1912â¦.â In the cases at 
bar, the 
Informations allege that the rapes were committed in May 1997. The dates
 cannot 
be condemned as too vague especially when the private complainant 
testified as 
to the specific week of May when the sexual assaults were committed 
against 
her.


We now review the penalties imposed by the trial 
court.


To impose the death penalty in qualified rape, the information 
must allege 
the special qualifying circumstances of relationship between the accused
 and the 
victim and the victimâs minority.
[43]
 In 
the cases at bar, the age of the victim was alleged and proved through 
her birth 
certificate.
[44]
 
The special circumstance 
of relationship, i.e, that the appellant is an uncle of the victim, was 
not 
alleged in the Informations. The fact that it was proved will not 
justify the 
imposition of the death penalty. Hence, the appellant can not be 
convicted of 
qualified rape and can only penalized be by
 reclusion 
perpetua.
[45]
 


We now come to the aggravating circumstance that the rapes were
 committed 
with the âuse of a deadly weapon.â Again, this circumstance was not 
alleged in 
the Informations. Thus, even if it was proven at the trial, it cannot 
qualify 
the crime and the trial court erred in using this circumstance to impose
 the 
death penalty against the appellant.
[46]




As regards the civil liabilities of the appellant, the 
prevailing 
jurisprudence calls for an award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity in 
favor of 
the victim. In addition, the victim should be given an award of moral 
damages, 
without need of proof other than the fact of the rape itself.
[47]
 


IN VIEW WHEREOF, 
the judgment of 
the Regional Trial Court of 
San Pedro, Laguna, Branch 31, finding the appellant, ANTONIO ABALA y 
LACANARIA, 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of four (4) counts of rape in Criminal 
Case Nos. 
0709-SPL, 0710-SPL, 0711-SPL and 0712-SPL, is AFFIRMED, with 
MODIFICATION that 
the appellant should be held liable of simple rapes and suffer the 
penalty of 
reclusion perpetua for each count of rape. Further, appellant is ordered
 to pay 
the private complainant the reduced amount of P50,000.00 as civil 
indemnity and 
P50,000.00 as moral damages for each count of rape. No pronouncement as 
to 
costs.
