private respondent Estrella V. Martinez, along with others, was reassigned 
from Assistant Revenue District Officer of Revenue District Office (RDO) No. 34 
- Paco - Pandacan - San Andres -Sta. Ana area - to Assistant Division Chief, 
Collection Programs Division, National Office in Quezon City, and assigned in 
her place, as Assistant Regional District Officer of RDO No. 34 was Jacinto T. 
Marcelo, erroneously referred to as Juanito T. Marcelo in RTAO 8-95.


On account of such reassignment, private respondent filed on April 4, 1995, 
with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, a petition for injunction docketed 
as Civil Case No. 95-23498 with prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary 
injunction and temporary restraining order, to restrain petitioner Marcelo from 
assuming the post of Assistant Regional District Officer of RDO No. 34.


In that petition, private respondent alleged that prior to the questioned 
RTAO 8-95, the retiring Revenue Officer of RDO No. 34, Jose T. Jacalan, wrote 
the BIR Commissioner endorsing and strongly recommending private respondents' 
promotion as Revenue Officer of RDO 34.
[2]
 Notwithstanding such recommendation, 
another BIR employee Isidro Tecson Jr., was assigned by the Commissioner in 
place of Jose T. Jacalan. This prompted private respondent to file with the 
Grievance Committee of the Department of Finance a complaint for violation of 
Merit Promotion Plan under BIR Memorandum Order No. 39-93. On July 10, 1995 the 
Grievance Committee issued a resolution enjoining the BIR to strictly adhere to 
the established and CSC-approved merit promotion plan in making the appointment 
to create equal opportunities for advancement to all qualified and competent 
employees of the BIR. According to private respondent, instead of complying with 
the said resolution, petitioner Chato, in a clear act of spite, whim, and 
vindictiveness against a subordinate employee who dared to question petitioners' 
unlawful acts, issued the now questioned RTAO 8-95. Private respondent now 
claims that the questioned RTAO 8-95, is tantamount to a demotion since the 
position she was transferred to - Assistant Division Chief, Collections Program 
Division Chief, National Office - does not involve assessment and is totally 
alien to the past experience and skills of private respondent as an Assistant 
Revenue District Officer of RDO 34. Besides private respondent asserts that she 
will be dislocated since she has no experience in the collection service, in 
violation of Executive Order No. 132 dated October 26, 1993 which prohibits the 
transfer of personnel resulting in dislocation. 


Acting on the petition, the trial court issued a temporary restraining order 
in an Order dated April 28, 1995. Thereafter, in an Order dated May 18, 1995, 
respondent Judge granted the writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the 
implementation of RTAO 8-95. The full text of the Order is quoted as follows: 





"For resolution is the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary 
injunction contained in the instant verified petition as well as the comment 
thereon filed by defendants [herein petitioners], through counsel, on May 5, 
1995, and the reply with prayer to restore parties to the status quo filed by 
plaintiff [herein private respondent], through counsel, on May 17, 1995.


"Plaintiff alleges that a certain Isidro Tecson Jr. was designated as Revenue 
District Officer of RDO 34 by herein defendant [petitioner] Commissioner despite 
the recommendation of the retiring RDO of RDO 34, Jose T. Jacalan, for plaintiff 
[Martinez] to be assigned in his place; that on the belief that she had superior 
qualifications than Tecson and being the next-in-rank, she lodged a complaint 
with the Selection Board of the BIR; that considering the length of time during 
which defendant Commissioner failed to act on her complaint, she subsequently 
filed a protest with the Grievance Committee of the Department of Finance which 
resolved that herein defendant Commissioner appoint a permanent RDO for RDO 34 
and adhere to the established and CSC approved merit promotion plan in making 
the appointment; that instead of complying with said resolution, herein 
defendant Commissioner issued Revenue Travel Assignment Order No. 8-95 wherein 
plaintiff [Martinez] was assigned from Assistant RDO of RDO 34 to Assistant 
Division Chief, Collection Programs Division, National Office and assigning in 
her place as Assistant RDO of RDO 34 (Paco - Pandacan - Sta. Ana - San Andres) 
defendant Jacinto Marcelo. She argues that her reassignment puts her in a 
freezer position tantamount to a demotion and dislocation; that defendant 
Commissioner's act of issuing the questioned Revenue Travel Assignment Order No. 
8-95 was made in clear bad faith intended to harass her in violation of Revenue 
Memorandum Order No. 32-93; and that this court has jurisdiction to issue a 
preliminary injunction in this case. 


"As prayed for, this Court in its Order dated April 28, 1995, issued a 
temporary restraining order enjoining defendant Commissioner or her subordinates 
from enforcing Revenue Travel Assignment Order No. 8-95 as it pertains to 
plaintiff [Martinez] and defendant Jacinto Marcelo. 


"Defendants, in their comment, qualified the material allegations in the 
petition arguing among others that plaintiff brought her complaint to the 
Grievance Committee of the DOF without waiting for the BIR's final action on her 
complaint pending receipt of Tecson's scholastic records from the Far Eastern 
University; that the (sic) February 9, 1995, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) 
issued Resolution No. 95-0785 dismissing plaintiff's protest against Tecson's 
designation; that in view of the said CSC's ruling, defendant Commissioner found 
no basis for taking further action on the resolution of the Grievance Committee 
of the Department of Finance; that it was in pursuance of her authority to 
transfer and assign BIR personnel in the exigency of the service that defendant 
Commissioner issued Revenue Travel Assignment Order No. 8-95; that Tecson's 
designation was not violative of the BIR's merit promotion plan as said Tecson 
was merely designated and not issued an appointment; that defendant 
Commissioner's exercise of her prerogative to assign/reassign personnel to meet 
exigencies of the service is beyond judicial interference. 


"After weighing the arguments raised by the parties in support of their 
respective claims, this Court determines that the grounds set forth in Rule 58, 
Section 3 of the Revised Rules of Court are present, hence, the issuance of a 
writ of preliminary injunction is warranted under the premises. 


"It appears that plaintiff [Martinez] was reassigned by defendant 
Commissioner by virtue of Revenue Travel Assignment Order No. 8-95 after she 
filed a complaint with the Selection Board of the BIR over the designation of 
one Isidro Tecson, Jr. as Revenue District Officer of Revenue District Office 
No. 34 (Paco - Pandacan - San Andres - Sta. Ana), a position which plaintiff 
[Martinez] sought to be appointed to. The issue of whether or not said Revenue 
Travel Assignment Order is valid and legal would still be threshed out during 
the trial on the merits. Thus, unless defendant Commissioner or her subordinates 
are enjoined from implementing Revenue Travel Assignment No. 8-95 as it pertains 
to plaintiff [Martinez] and defendant Marcelo, plaintiff [Martinez] would 
thereby suffer great and irreparable injury if it is determined that her 
assignment is irregular and illegal. 


"This Court resolves to grant the issuance of a writ of preliminary 
injunction upon the posting of a bond in the amount of P50,000.00 which bond 
shall answer for damages which may be sustained by reason of the issuance of a 
writ of preliminary injunction, if it turns out that the plaintiff [Martinez] is 
not entitled thereto.


SO ORDERED."
[3]
 


Hence, on June 28, 1995, petitioners filed the present petition for 
certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court assailing the above Order. 


Petitioners argue that the reassignment of revenue district officers was made 
pursuant to Executive Order No. 132 for the purpose of improving revenue 
collection. The writ hampers the serious efforts of the Government to 
re-organize the BIR to meet the urgent need for increased and efficient tax 
collection to support the economic development and growth of the Philippines, as 
embodied in Executive Order No. 132 (October 26, 1993). Besides, private 
respondent allegedly failed to show any legal or vested right to her position as 
Assistant Revenue District Officer of RDO No. 34 since she was merely assigned 
thereto and neither did private respondent show any right to be exempted from 
the reorganization. Private respondent holds the appointment of Chief Revenue 
Officer II and, whether she be assigned to another revenue district, revenue 
region or to the national office, she remains Chief Revenue Officer II, the 
position she was appointed to. Thus, there was no demotion in the reassignment 
since there was no reduction in duties, responsibilities, status, rank or 
salary.


On July 31, 1995, this Court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) 
enjoining the respondents from implementing the questioned Order of May 18, 1995 
issued by the respondent court in Civil Case No. Q-95-23498. Meanwhile, on 
August 11, 1995, private respondent Martinez wrote a letter to the Regional 
Director of Revenue Region No. 6, Manila as follows:




"Please be informed that the undersigned through her counsel received a copy 
of the Supreme Court Resolution dated July 31, 1995 on August 1, 1995. Court 
Orders takes effect fifteen (15) days after issuance should there be no motion 
for reconsideration filed of such order. 


"Since the fifteen (15) day period has not yet elapsed, the said Supreme 
Court Resolution is not yet final and executory. Please be informed likewise 
that within the said fifteen day period, I will be taking the appropriate legal 
remedies available to me by law."
[4]




Thereupon, private respondent Martinez went on leave of absence on August 21, 
1995. 


By reason of petitioner's failure to comply with RTAO 8-95, the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue (BIR) rendered a Decision dated May 9, 1996 suspending private 
respondent Martinez for one (1) month on the ground of gross insubordination in 
accordance with Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and 
Regulations. It was likewise ruled that private respondent need not to go on 
leave of absence because she is 
ipso facto
 considered on leave of absence 
upon her failure to comply within ten (10) days from the receipt of RTAO 8-95, 
citing BIR Field Circular No. V-75 dated October 21, 1953. 


Because of the suspension, on July 9, 1996, private respondent filed a motion 
to cite Chato in contempt of Court alleging therein that the suspension order 
issued by petitioner Chato pre-empts any decision of this Court on the validity 
and legality of RTAO 8-95. On October 16, 1996, this motion of private 
respondent to cite petitioner Chato in contempt of court was denied for lack of 
merit,
[5]
 which denial became final after 
the motion for reconsideration filed by respondent Martinez was denied by this 
Court on January 13, 1997. 
[6]
 


In the third urgent motion for early resolution filed by private respondent 
on November 10, 1998, she claims that she was compelled to use her accumulated 
leave credits amounting to over 350 working days in order to resist the order of 
petitioner Chato. Thus, she prays for the nullification of the unlawful orders 
of Petitioner Chato so that private respondent's accumulated leave credits will 
be restored. 


The petition is meritorious. 


The Commissioner of Internal Revenue is authorized to assign or reassign 
internal revenue officers and employees of the BIR as the exigencies of service 
may require, without demotion in rank and salary in accordance with Civil 
Service Rules and Regulation. The primary reason why private respondent refuses 
to comply with RTAO 8-95 was because she took it as an act of vindictiveness and 
reprisal on the part of the Commissioner, consequent to her filing a complaint 
against the assigned RDO of RDO No. 34 Isidoro Tecson, Jr. (now deceased), on 
the basis of a prior assignment order issued by the Commissioner. Nowhere in the 
assignment order, RTAO 8-95, can it be gleaned that the reassignment was for the 
purpose of harassing private respondent. In fact, private respondent was not the 
only one reassigned to a new post. 


Private respondent holds the appointment of Chief Revenue Officer II and such 
appointment will not be altered by her subsequent reassignment as Assistant 
Division Chief of the Collection Programs Division, National Office. Such 
reassignment is not a demotion for there is no diminution of rank, salary, 
status and responsibilities. Private respondent was merely assigned as Assistant 
Revenue District Officer of BIR Revenue District Office No. 34 and the 
Commissioner may assign or reassign revenue officers, as the exigencies of the 
service may require. Such reassignment of revenue officers entails the 
prevention of familiarity and patronage between BIR officers and taxpayers of a 
particular area. Accordingly, the injunction issued against the implementation 
of RTAO 8-95 was unwarranted because private respondent failed to establish a 
valid claim or a vested right to the post of Assistant Revenue District Officer 
of RDO No. 34. Therefore, the respondent judge committed grave abuse of 
discretion in granting the writ of preliminary injunction because private 
respondent has no actual existing right which is infringed upon by RTAO No. 
8-95. 


There is no merit in the argument of private respondent that she will be 
demoted by her transfer to the National Office, Collection Programs Division 
because she was reassigned to a position totally alien to her proven area of 
expertise in assessment. The authority of the BIR Commissioner to issue 
reassignment order has been upheld by this Court in an En Banc Decision dated 
June 2, 1995, in the case of 
Hon. Liwayway Vinzons-Chato vs. Hon. Eli G. 
C. Natividad
,
[7]
 where we held 
that: 




"Private respondent failed to show patent illegality in the action of the 
Commissioner constituting violation of his right to security of tenure. 
To 
sustain his contention that his transfer constitutes a demotion simply because 
the new assignment is not to his liking would be to subordinate government 
projects, along with the great resources and efforts they entail, to the 
individual preferences and opinions of civil service employees. Such contention 
would negate the principle that a public office is a public trust and that it is 
not the private preserve of any person."
 (Emphasis Supplied) 



In line with the said Decision, this Court cannot sustain the contention of 
private respondent that she was forced to use more than three hundred fifty 
(350) days of her accumulated leave credits in order to resist the assailed RTAO 
8-95, and prays that her leave credits be restored. The writ of preliminary 
injunction issued by the trial court, which enjoined the transfer of private 
respondent, was countermanded by the temporary restraining order subsequently 
issued by this Court, with the result that petitioner's transfer became 
effective again. We therefore find that the trial court committed a grave abuse 
of discretion in issuing the assailed writ of preliminary injunction.
