RUPERTO A. AMBIL, JR., PETITIONER, VS. THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS (FIRST DIVISION, FORMERLY SECOND DIVISION) AND JOSE T. RAMIREZ, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, ACTING CJ.:


The case before the Court is a special civil action for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order seeking to nullify the order dated June 15, 2000 of the Commission on Elections (Comelec), First Division,
[1]
 giving 
notice 
to the parties of the promulgation of the 
resolution on the case 
entitled Jose T. Ramirez, Protestee, versus Ruperto A. Ambil, Jr., Election Protest Case No. 98-29, on June 20, 2000, at 2:00 in the afternoon and to prohibit the respondent Commission on Election from promulgating the so called "Guiani 
ponencia."
[2]
 
 
The facts are as follows:
 
Petitioner Ruperto A. Ambil, Jr. and respondent Jose T. Ramirez were candidates for the position of Governor, Eastern Samar, during the May 11, 1998 elections.
[3]
 On May 16, 1998, the Provincial Board of Canvassers proclaimed Ruperto A. Ambil, Jr. as the duly elected Governor, Eastern Samar, having obtained 46,547 votes, the highest number of votes in the election returns.
 
On June 4, 1998, respondent Ramirez who obtained 45,934 votes, the second highest number of votes, filed with the Comelec, an election protest
[4]
 challenging the results in a total of 201 precincts.
[5]
 The case was assigned to the First Division (formerly Second), Commission on Elections.
[6]
 
 
On January 27, 2000, Commissioner Japal M. Guiani prepared and signed a proposed resolution in the case. To such proposed 
ponencia
, Commissioner Julio F. Desamito dissented. Commissioner Luzviminda G. Tancangco at first did not indicate her vote but said that she would "wish to see both positions, if any, to make her (my) final decision."
[7]
 
 
In the meantime, on February 15, 2000, Commissioner Guiani retired from the service. On March 3, 2000, the President of the Philippines appointed Commissioner Rufino S. Javier to the seat vacated by Commissioner Guiani. Commissioner Javier assumed office on April 4, 2000.
 
On or about February 24, 2000, petitioner Ambil and respondent Ramirez received a purported resolution promulgated on February 14, 2000, signed by Commissioner Guiani and Tancangco, with Commissioner Desamito dissenting. The result was in favor of respondent Ramirez who was declared winner by a margin of 1,176 votes.
[8]
 On February 28, 2000, the Comelec, First Division, declared that the thirteen-page resolution "is a useless scrap of paper which should be ignored by the parties in this case there being no promulgation of the Resolution in the instant case." 
[9]
 
 
On March 31, 2000, the Comelec, First Division, issued an order setting the promulgation of the resolution in the case (EPC Case No. 98-29) on April 6, 2000, at 2:00 in the afternoon.
[10]
 However, on April 6, 2000, petitioner Ambil filed a motion to cancel promulgation challenging the validity of the purported Guiani resolution. The Comelec, First Division, acting on the motion, on the same date, postponed the promulgation until this matter is resolved.
[11]
 
On June 14, 2000, two members of the First Division, namely, Commissioners Luzviminda G. Tancangco and Rufino S. Javier, sent a joint memorandum to Commissioner Julio F. Desamito, presiding Commissioner, stating: 
 
 
"Pursuant to your recommendation in your April 18, 2000 Memorandum to the Commission En Banc 
that this case be submitted for a reconsultation by the members of the First Division,
 it is our position that we promulgate as soon as possible the 
Guiani Resolution 
of the case. This is notwithstanding the 
Jamil vs. Comelec (283 SCRA 349), Solidbank vs. IAC (G. R. No. 73777)
 and other doctrinal cases on the issue. After all, this Commission stood pat on its policy that what is controlling is the date the 
ponente
 signed the questioned Resolution as what we did in promulgating the case of 
Dumayas vs. Bernal (SPC 98-137).
 
"In view of the foregoing, we recommend that we proceed with the promulgation of the subject resolution and let the aggrieved party challenge it through a Motion for Reconsideration before the Commission 
en banc
 or through a certiorari case before the Supreme Court.
[12]
 
 
On June 15, 2000, the Comelec, First Division, through Commissioner Julio F. Desamito, issued an order setting the promulgation of the resolution in the case on June 20, 2000, at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon.
[13]
 
 
Without waiting for the promulgation of the resolution, on June 19, 2000, petitioner interposed the instant petition.
[14]
 
 
Petitioner Ambil seeks to annul the order dated June 15, 2000 setting the promulgation of the resolution of the case (EPC Case No. 98-29) on June 20, 2000 at 2:00 in the afternoon, and prohibiting the Comelec, First Division, from promulgating the purported Guiani resolution and directing the Comelec, First Division, to deliberate anew on the case and to promulgate the resolution reached in the case after such deliberation.
[15]
 
On June 20, 2000, we issued a temporary restraining order enjoining respondent Comelec from implementing the June 15, 2000 order for the promulgation of the resolution set on June 20, 2000 at 2:00 in the afternoon. At the same time, the Court directed the respondents to comment on the petition within ten (10) days from notice. 
[16]
 
 
On July 10, 2000, respondent Ramirez filed his comment.
[17]
 Respondent Ramirez admitted that the proposed resolution of Commissioner Guiani was no longer valid after his retirement on February 15, 2000.
[18]
 He submitted that Comelec, First Division, its membership still constituting a majority, must elevate the protest case to the Comelec 
en banc
 until resolved with finality.
[19]
 
In his comment filed on August 29, 2000, the Solicitor General interposed no objection to the petition.
[20]
 
 
At issue in this petition is whether Comelec, First Division, in scheduling the promulgation of the resolution in the case (EPC Case No. 98-29) acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.
 
We find the petition without merit.
 
To begin with, the power of the Supreme Court to review decisions of the Comelec is prescribed in the Constitution, as follows:
 
 
"Section 7. Each commission shall decide by a majority vote of all its members any case or matter brought before it within sixty days from the date of its submission for decision or resolution. A case or matter is deemed submitted for decision or resolution upon the filing of the last pleading, brief, or memorandum required by the rules of the commission or by the commission itself. Unless otherwise provided by
 
this constitution
 
or by law,
 any decision, order, or ruling of each 
commission
 may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party within thirty days from receipt of a copy thereof."
[21]
 [emphasis supplied]
 
"We have interpreted this provision to mean 
final orders, rulings and decisions
 of the COMELEC rendered in the exercise of its adjudicatory or quasi-judicial powers."
[22]
 This decision must be a 
final decision or resolution
 of the Comelec 
en banc
,
[23]
 
not of a division
,
[24]
 certainly not an interlocutory order 
of a division.
[25]
 The Supreme Court has no power to review 
via certiorari,
 an interlocutory order or even a final resolution of a Division of the Commission on Elections.
[26]
 
 
The mode by which a decision, order or ruling of the Comelec en banc may be elevated to the Supreme Court is by the special civil action of 
certiorari
 under Rule 65 of the 1964 Revised Rules of Court, now expressly provided in Rule 64, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended.
[27]
 
 
Rule 65, Section 1, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, requires that there be no 
appeal
, 
or any plain, speedy
 and 
adequate remedy 
in the ordinary course of law. A motion for reconsideration 
is a plain 
and 
adequate remedy provided by law.
[28]
 
Failure to abide
 by this procedural requirement 
constitutes a ground for dismissal of the petition.
[29]
 
 
In like manner, a decision, order or resolution of a division of the Comelec must be reviewed by the Comelec 
en banc via
 a motion for reconsideration before the final 
en banc
 decision may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari. The pre-requisite filing of a motion for reconsideration is mandatory.
[30]
 Article IX-C, Section 3, 1987 Constitution provides as follows: 
 
 
"Section 3. The Commission on Elections may sit 
en banc
 or in two divisions, and shall promulgate its rules of procedure in order to expedite disposition of election cases, including pre-proclamation controversies. All such election cases shall be heard and decided in division, 
provided that motions for reconsideration of decisions shall be decided by the Commission 
en banc.
 
[emphasis supplied]
 
Similarly, the Rules of Procedure of the Comelec provide that a decision of a division may be raised to the 
en banc
 
via
 a motion for reconsideration.
[31]
 
 
The case at bar is an election protest involving the position of Governor, Eastern Samar.
[32]
Â  It is within the original jurisdiction of the Commission on Elections in division.
[33]
 Admittedly, petitioner did not ask for a reconsideration of the division's resolution or final decision
.
[34]
 
In fact, there was really no resolution or decision to speak of 
[35]
 because there was yet no promulgation, which was still scheduled on June 20, 2000 at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon. Petitioner went directly to the Supreme Court from an order of "promulgation of the Resolution of this case" by the First Division of the Comelec.
[36]
 
Under the existing Constitutional scheme, a party to an election case within the jurisdiction of the Comelec in division can not dispense with the filing of a motion for reconsideration of a decision, resolution or final order of the Division of the Commission on Elections because the case would not reach the Comelec 
en banc
 without such motion for reconsideration having been filed and resolved by the Division.
 
The instant case does not fall under any of the recognized exceptions to the rule in certiorari cases dispensing with a motion for reconsideration prior to the filing of a petition.
[37]
 In truth, the exceptions do 
not apply to election cases 
where a motion for reconsideration is 
mandatory 
by Constitutional fiat 
to elevate the case to the Comelec 
en banc,
 
whose final decision is what is reviewable 
via
 certiorari before the Supreme Court.
[38]
 
 
We are aware of the ruling in Kho v. Commission on Elections,
[39]
 that "in a situation such as this where the Commission on Elections in division committed grave abuse of discretion or acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in issuing interlocutory orders relative to an action pending before it and the controversy did not fall under any of the instances mentioned in Section 2, Rule 3 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, the remedy of the aggrieved party is not to refer the controversy to the Commission en banc as this is not permissible under its present rules but to elevate it to this Court via a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court." This is the case relied upon by the dissenting justice to support the proposition that resort to the Supreme Court from a resolution of a Comelec Division is allowed.
[40]
 Unfortunately, the Kho case has no application to the case at bar. The issue therein is, may the Commission on Elections in division
 admit an answer with counter-protest after the period to file the same has expired?
[41]
 The Comelec First Division admitted the answer with counter-protest of the respondent. The Supreme Court declared such order void for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.
[42]
 However, an important 
moiety
 in the Kho case 
was not mentioned
 in the dissent. It is that the Comelec, First Division, 
denied
 the prayer of petitioner for the 
elevation of the case to 
en banc
 
because the orders of admission were mere 
interlocutory orders.
[43]
 Hence, the aggrieved party 
had no choice 
but to seek recourse in the Supreme Court. Such important fact is
 not present 
in the case at bar.
 
We must emphasize that what is questioned here is the order dated June 15, 2000, which is a mere 
notice 
of the promulgation of the resolution in EPC Case No. 98-29. We quote the order in question in full, to wit: 
 
 
"Pursuant to Section 5 of Rule 18 of the COMELEC RULES OF PROCEDURE, and the Joint Memorandum of Commissioners Luzviminda G. Tancangco and Rufino S. Javier to the Presiding Commissioner of the First Division dated 14 June 2000 paragraph 5 of which states:
 
 
`
In view of the foregoing, we recommend that we proceed with the promulgation of the subject resolution and let the aggrieved party challenge it through a Motion for Reconsideration before the Commission en banc or through a certiorari case before the Supreme Court.'
 
 
the promulgation of the 
Resolution
 in this case is hereby set on 
Tuesday, June 20, 2000 
at
 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon 
at the Comelec Session Hall, Intramuros, Manila.
 
No further motion for postponement of the promulgation shall be entertained.
 
The Clerk of the Commission is directed to give the parties, through their Attorneys, notice of this Order through telegram and by registered mail or personal delivery. 
 
"SO ORDERED.
 
 
"Given this 15th day of June, 2000 in the City of Manila, Philippines.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FOR THE DIVISION: 
 
 
 
 
 
[Sgd.] JULIO F. DESAMITO 
 
 
 
 
 
Presiding Commissioner"
[44]
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is nothing irregular about the order of promulgation of the resolution in the case, except in the mind of suspicious parties. Perhaps what was wrong in the order was the reference to the memorandum of the two commissioners that was not necessary and was a superfluity, or 
excessus
 in linguae
. All the members of the Division were incumbent Commissioners of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) and had authority to decide the case in the Division. What appears to be patently 
null and void 
is the so-called Guiani resolution if it is the one to be promulgated. We cannot assume that the Comelec will promulgate a void resolution and violate the Constitution and the law. We must assume that the members of the Commission in Division or 
en banc
 are sworn to uphold and will obey the Constitution.
 
Consequently, the Guiani 
resolution is not at issue 
in the case at bar. No one knows the contents of the sealed envelope containing the resolution to be promulgated on June 20, 2000, simply because it has not been promulgated!
 
It may be true that the parties received a copy of what purports to be the Guiani resolution,
[45]
 
declaring respondent Jose T. Ramirez the victor in the case.
 
Such Guiani resolution is admitted by the parties and considered by the Commission on Elections 
as void. 
The Solicitor General submitted an advice that the same resolution is deemed vacated by the retirement of Commissioner Guiani on February 15, 2000.
[46]
 It can not be promulgated anymore for all legal intents and purposes.
 
We rule that the so-called Guiani resolution is void for the following reasons:
 
First: 
A final decision or resolution becomes binding only after it is promulgated and not before. Accordingly, one who is no longer a member of the Commission at the time the final decision or resolution is promulgated cannot validly take part in that resolution or decision.
[47]
 Much more could he be the 
ponente
 of the resolution or decision. The resolution or decision of the Division must be 
signed
 by a majority of its members 
and duly promulgated.
 
Commissioner Guiani might have signed a draft 
ponencia
 prior to his retirement from office, but when he vacated his office without the final decision or resolution having been promulgated, his vote was automatically invalidated.
[48]
 Before that resolution or decision is so 
signed and promulgated, 
there is no valid resolution or decision to speak of.
[49]
 
Second: 
Atty. Zacarias C. Zaragoza, Jr., Clerk of the First Division, Commission on Elections, denied the release or promulgation of the Guiani resolution. He disowned the initials on the face of the first page of the resolution showing its promulgation on February 14, 2000, and said that it was a forgery. There is no record in the Electoral Contests and Adjudication Department (ECAD) of the Commission on Election that a "resolution on the main merits of the case was promulgated."
[50]
 
 
Third: 
By an order dated 
February 28, 2000
, the Comelec, First Division, 
disclaimed the "alleged 
thirteen (13) page 
resolution" 
for being "a 
useless scrap of paper 
which should be 
ignored by the parties" 
there being 
no promulgation of the resolution in the case.
[51]
 
Fourth: 
It is unlikely that Commissioner Tancangco affixed her signature on the Guiani resolution. On the date that it was purportedly promulgated, which was February 14, 2000, the Division issued an order where Commissioner Tancangco expressed her reservations and stated that she wished 
to see 
both 
positions, 
if any, before 
she made her final decision.
[52]
 
 
A final decision or resolution of the Comelec, in Division or 
en banc 
is promulgated on a date previously fixed, of which 
notice shall be served in advance upon the parties or their attorneys personally or by registered mail or by telegram.
[53]
 
It is jurisprudentially recognized that at any time before promulgation of a decision or resolution, the ponente may change his mind.
[54]
 Moreover, in this case, before a final decision or resolution could be promulgated, the ponente retired and a new commissioner appointed. And the incoming commissioner has decided to take part in the resolution of the case. It is presumed that he had taken the position of his predecessor because he co-signed the request for the promulgation of the Guiani resolution.
[55]
 
If petitioner were afraid that what would be promulgated by the Division was the Guiani resolution, a copy of which he received by mail, which, as heretofore stated, was not promulgated and the signature thereon of the clerk of court was a forgery, petitioner could seek reconsideration of such patently void resolution and thereby the case would be elevated to the Commission 
en banc
.
[56]
 
 
Considering the factual circumstances, we speculated 
ex mero motu
 that the Comelec would promulgate a void resolution. 
 
"The sea of suspicion has no shore, and the court that embarks upon it is without rudder or compass."
[57]
 We must not speculate that the Comelec would still promulgate a void resolution despite knowledge that it is invalid or void
 ab initio
.
 
Consequently, the filing of the instant petition before this Court was premature. Petitioner failed to exhaust adequate administrative remedies available before the COMELEC.
 
In a long line of cases, this Court has held consistently that "before a party is allowed to seek the intervention of the court, it is a pre-condition that he should have availed of all the means of administrative processes afforded him. Hence, if a remedy within the administrative machinery can still be resorted to by giving the administrative officer concerned every opportunity to decide on a matter that comes within his jurisdiction, then such remedy should be exhausted first before the court's judicial power can be sought. The premature invocation of court's intervention 
is fatal
 
to one's cause of action."
[58]
 
"This is the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies. A motion for reconsideration then is a pre-requisite to the viability of a special civil action for 
certiorari
, unless the party who avails of the latter can convincingly show that his case falls under any of the following exceptions to the rule: (1) when the question is purely legal, (2) where judicial intervention is urgent, (3) where its application may cause great and irreparable damage, (4) where the controverted acts violate due process, (5) failure of a high government official from whom relief is sought to act on the matter, and seeks when the issue for non-exhaustion of administrative remedies has been rendered moot."
[59]
 
"This doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies was not without its practical and legal reasons, for one thing, availment of administrative remedy entails lesser expenses and provides for a speedier disposition of controversies. It is no less true to state that the courts of justice for reasons of comity and convenience will shy away from a dispute until the system of administrative redress has been completed and complied with so as to give the administrative agency concerned every opportunity to correct its error and to dispose of the case. However, we are not amiss to reiterate that the principal of exhaustion of administrative remedies as tested by a battery of cases is not an ironclad rule. This doctrine is a relative one and its flexibility is called upon by the peculiarity and uniqueness of the factual and circumstantial settings of a case. Hence, it is disregarded (1) when there is a violation of due process, (2) when the issue involved is purely a legal question, (3) when the administrative action is patently illegal amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, (4) when there is estoppel on the part of the administrative agency concerned, (5) when there is irreparable injury, (6) when the respondent is a department secretary whose acts as an alter ego of the president bears the implied and assumed approval of the latter, (7) when to require exhaustion of administrative remedies would be unreasonable, (8) when it would amount to a nullification of a claim, (9) when the subject matter is a private land in land case proceedings, (10) when the rule does not provide a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, and (11) when there are circumstances indicating the urgency of judicial intervention."
[60]
 The administrative authorities must be given an opportunity to act and correct the errors committed in the administrative forum.
[61]
 Only after administrative remedies are exhausted may judicial recourse be allowed.
[62]
 
 
This case does not fall under any of the exceptions and indeed, as heretofore stated, the exceptions do not apply to an election case within the jurisdiction of the Comelec in Division.
 
Hence, the petition at bar must be dismissed for prematurity. "Failure to exhaust administrative remedies is fatal to a party's cause of action and a dismissal based on that ground is tantamount to a dismissal based on lack of cause of action."
[63]
 
 
WHEREFORE
, the Court hereby DISMISSES the petition for prematurity.
 
The Court orders the Commission on Elections, First Division, to resolve with all deliberate dispatch Election Protest Case No. 98-29 and to promulgate its resolution thereon adopted by majority vote within thirty (30) days from notice hereof.
 
The temporary restraining order issued on June 20, 2000, is hereby lifted and dissolved, effective immediately.
 
No costs.
