KAPUNAN, J.:


On June 30, 1993, the Olongapo City Council enacted Ordinance 
No. 14 (Series of 1993), fixing the monthly rental fees for the different stalls 
in the new public market. Respondents questioned the validity of said ordinance 
by filing an appeal to the Secretary of Justice. The appeal was made pursuant to 
Section 187 of the Local Government Code,
[1] 

which states:




SEC. 187. 
Procedure for Approval and Effectivity of Tax 
Ordinances and Revenue Measures; Mandatory Public Hearings
. - The procedure 
for approval of local tax ordinances and revenue measures shall be in accordance 
with the provisions of this Code: 
Provided
, That public hearings shall be 
conducted for the purpose prior to the enactment thereof: 
Provided, 
further
, That 
any question on the constitutionality or legality of tax 
ordinances or revenue measures may be raised on appeal within thirty (30) days 
from the effectivity thereof to the Secretary of Justice who shall render a 
decision within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the appeal:


Provided, however
, That such appeal shall not have the effect of 
suspending the effectivity of the ordinance and the accrual and payment of the 
tax, fee, or charge levied therein: 
Provided, finally
, That within thirty 
(30) days after receipt of the decision or the lapse of the sixty-day period 
without the Secretary of Justice acting upon the appeal, the aggrieved party may 
file appropriate proceedings with a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Underscoring supplied.)


As grounds for their appeal, respondents alleged that the 
ordinance: (1) violated Sections 130
[2]
 
and 186
[3]
 of the Local Government Code 
as the rates fixed therein are unjust, excessive, oppressive, confiscatory, not 
equitable, not based as far as practicable on the market vendors' ability to 
pay, and contrary to declared national policy; (2) was sought to be implemented 
despite lack of publication; and (3) did not comply with "the essence and spirit 
of the public hearings."
[4]
 


In a Resolution dated September 29, 1993, the Secretary of 
Justice upheld the validity of Ordinance No. 14 (Series of 1993). 


Respondents moved for a reconsideration of the Justice 
Secretary's Resolution. The Secretary of Justice, however, refrained from taking 
action on respondents' motion for reconsideration apparently in view of the 
pendency of a case
[5]
 filed in this Court 
questioning the validity of said Section 187. In a Letter dated November 23, 
1993 and addressed to counsel for respondents, Chief State Counsel Elmer T. 
Bautista wrote: 




With reference to your Motion for Reconsideration on the 
Resolution of this Office dated September 29, 1993, upholding the 
constitutionality and legality of Ordinance No. 14, s. 1993 of the City of 
Olongapo, please be informed that in view of the adverse ruling of the Regional 
Trial Court of Manila (Branch 33) dated October 26, 1993, and pending final 
determination by the Supreme Court on the constitutionality of Section 187 of 
Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991), the Secretary of Justice 
deemed it appropriate to refrain from taking action thereon in the meantime. 



Per the Secretary's Memorandum dated November 5, 1993, copy 
attached, you are, however, advised to file your appeal with the court of 
competent jurisdiction.
[6]




The contents of the "Secretary's Memorandum" referred to in the 
above letter is reproduced below: 




In view of the adverse ruling of the Regional Trial Court of 
Manila (Branch 33) dated October 26, 1993, and pending final determination by 
the Supreme Court of the constitutionality of Section 187 of Republic Act No. 
7160 (Local Government Code of 1991) which empowers the Secretary of Justice to 
pass upon on appeal, the legality and/or constitutionality of tax ordinances or 
revenue measures adopted by local government units, you are hereby directed to 
refrain from taking action on and/or accepting petitions/appeals filed in 
accordance with said legal mandate, and inform the appellants thereto to file 
their appeal directly with the courts.
[7]




On December 22, 1993, respondents filed before the Regional 
Trial Court (RTC) of Olongapo City an "action to declare void Olongapo City 
Ordinance No. 14, s. of 1992 and for writ of prohibition." 


The City of Olongapo moved for the dismissal of the petition on 
the ground that it did not state a cause of action. The RTC, however, held in 
abeyance the resolution of this motion until after trial on the merits shall 
have been terminated, the ground relied upon by the City being "not 
indubitable."
[8


]
 At the pre-trial, the 
parties agreed to limit themselves to the following issues: (1) whether the 
ordinance was void; and (2) whether the proposed fees are equitable, justifiable 
and affordable.
[9]


Thereafter, the City of Olongapo filed a Motion for Summary 
Judgment. Finding there were no genuine issues as to any material fact, the RTC 
granted the motion in an Order dated October 20, 1995. On January 30, 1996, the 
RTC, without trial, rendered a decision sustaining the validity of Ordinance No. 
14 (Series of 1993). The dispositive portion of the decision reads: 




WHEREFORE, and the foregoing premises considered, the legality 
or constitutionality of Ordinance No. 14, Series of 1993, enacted by the City 
Council of Olongapo City on June 30, 1993 and which took effect on July 7, 1993, 
is UPHELD. 


The Complaint is DISMISSED. 


SO ORDERED.
[10]




Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals, assigning the 
following errors: 




(A.) THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED GRAVE AND REVERSIBLE ERROR IN 
DECIDING THE CASE ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT UNDER RULE 34 OF THE RULES OF COURT. 


(B.) THE LOWER COURT DID NOT ACCORD DUE PROCESS TO THE 
APPELLANTS. 


(C.) THE DECISION IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE.
[11]
 


In its Decision dated August 31, 1998, the Court of Appeals 
held that the issue of the ordinance's publication did not require any trial and 
that the City had complied with the requirements of publication. It declared: 





As to the issue [of] whether or not the enactment of Ordinance 
No. 14, Series of 1993 is void insofar as the procedural requirements of the 
Local Government Code or R.A. 7160 on the approval of revenue measures under 
Rules 187 and 188 thereof is concerned, we find that the trial court did not err 
in finding that no genuine triable issue exists that requires trial on the 
merits..


Exhibits "4", "4-A", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9" and "10" attached 
to the Answer undisputedly show that proper publication, posting in public 
places, and public hearings were complied with in accordance with the 
requirements of the Local Government Code of 1991. We find no genuine triable 
issue on this matter and therefore the trial court committed no reversible error 
in rendering summary judgment thereon. We agree with the RTC that the procedural 
requirements have been met by the City Council of defendant Olongapo City in the 
enactment of the subject ordinance. There were publications, posting and public 
hearings as shown by the aforementioned exhibits of defendants. The fact that 
appellants' views were not considered by the City Council does not render the 
enactment of the ordinance invalid.
[12]


However, as regards the question of whether the market rental 
rates were unjust, excessive, confiscatory and inequitable, the Court of Appeals 
held that the same was a factual issue that required the presentation of 
evidence. Consequently, it remanded the case to the RTC for trial on this issue. 



Aggrieved by the decision of the Court of Appeals, the City of 
Olongapo brought the instant petition for review. 


The nature of the proceedings conducted before the RTC is at 
issue in this case. 


Petitioner City of Olongapo submits that the RTC merely 
reviewed the decision of the Secretary of Justice upholding the validity of 
Ordinance No. 14 (Series of 1993). As such, the review by the RTC was confined 
to the evidence presented in the administrative proceedings. Petitioner, citing 
the cases of 
Santos vs. Moreno
[13]
and 
Taleon vs. Secretary of Public 
Works and Communications
,
[14]
 argues 
that evidence not presented before the Secretary of Justice should not be 
admitted and considered by the reviewing court. The RTC's function, according to 
petitioner, is limited to determining whether there is evidence in the 
administrative record substantial enough to support the findings therein; hence, 
the CA erred in ordering the remand of the case for trial. 


Respondents, on the other hand, contend that the petition filed 
in the RTC was an original action. The Court of Appeals agreed with respondents, 
holding that, based on the allegations of the complaint, the case brought by 
respondents was an original case. 


We find no error in this ruling for it is elementary that the 
nature of the action is determined by the allegations of the complaint or 
petition.
[15]
 Respondents explicitly 
alleged in their petition that: 


This is a petition to declare void the rates for market stalls at the 
Pag-asa Public Market imposed under Ordinance No. 14 s. of 1992 of the City of 
Olongapo for being unjust, excessive, oppressive, confiscatory, and, contrary to 
declared national policy.
[16]
 


The petition alleged the same grounds for declaring the 
ordinance void as those raised in the appeal to the Secretary of Justice, thus: 



III. Grounds For Voiding Ordinance
No. 46 s. of 1992 


Ordinance No. 14, s. of 1993 violates Section 130, and, 186 of the Local 
Government Code of 1991, because the rates therein fixed are unjust, excessive, 
oppressive, confiscatory, not equitable and based as far as practicable on the 
market vendors['] ability to pay, and, contrary to declared national policy. 



Ordinance No. 14, s. of 1993 is sought to be implemented already, yet, as 
far as known to the appellants, it has not yet been published in full for three 
(3) consecutive days in a newspaper of local circulation. 


The essence and spirit of the public hearing was not complied with.
[17]
 


Consider, too, the circumstances under which respondents sought 
relief from the RTC. Perhaps doubting his jurisdiction to entertain respondents' 
appeal as a result of the filing of 
Drilon vs. Lim, supra
, the Justice 
Secretary issued a Memorandum directing the Chief State Counsel to refrain from 
acting on or accepting appeals filed under Section 187 of the Local Government 
Code and to "inform the appellants (herein petitioners) to file their appeal 
directly with the courts." The Chief State Counsel, complying with the 
Memorandum, advised in his letter to respondents to "file their
 appeal
 
with the court of competent jurisdiction," the "appeal" referring to an action 
to question the validity of the subject ordinance. The Memorandum and the 
accompanying letter thus amounted to an abdication by the Secretary of Justice 
of his jurisdiction over the appeal, as conferred by Section 187. 


Accordingly, the action before the RTC cannot be deemed to be 
anything but an original action, and the function of the trial court cannot be 
limited to reviewing the evidence adduced before the Secretary of Justice. 


Nevertheless, petitioner maintains that trial is unnecessary in 
any case because all the court had to do was determine whether the rates fixed 
in the assailed ordinance conform to Department of Interior and Local Government 
Memorandum Circular No. 93-63, specifically the provision limiting the return of 
investment to 12 to 15% and that requiring a cost recovery scheme. Presumably, 
this determination can be made, as both the Secretary of Justice and the RTC 
did, by a mere examination of the documents submitted by petitioner.


However, it is precisely the accuracy of these documents that 
respondents are disputing. Consequently, respondents may examine the officials 
who executed said documents. They may present their own evidence, both 
documentary and testimonial, to prove that the figures in the documents are 
inaccurate. All these require a trial so that the parties may properly ventilate 
their respective causes. Thus, the CA correctly ruled that: 




The lower court based its conclusion that the market rates are 
just and equitable in accordance with the Local Government Code on the 
affidavits of one Loreto P. Azores, the City Treasurer of defendant and member 
of the Local Finance Committee 
(p. 204, Original Records)
; and Johnny B. 
Choa, City Budget Officer of defendant and the Officer in Charge of the City 
Accountant's Office as well as a member of the Local Finance Committee 
(p. 
207, id.). 
In view of the complaint of plaintiffs-appellants as to the 
equitableness, justifiability and affordability of the market rates imposed, it 
behooved the trial court to conduct trial on the merits which would involve, 
among others, the cross-examination of said affiants so as to determine whether 
or not the computation of the Local Finance Committee is based on facts or mere 
estimates. Fundamental issues as to the details concerning the issue of 
expenditures in constructing a public market place; the claim of 
plaintiffs-appellants that the construction of the new public market came from 
the Mt. Pinatubo Calamity Fund, at no cost to the City 
(p. 20, Brief for the 
Plaintiffs-Appellants)
; the actual cost of operations and basis of computed 
revenue; the validity of the schedule of personal services; the actual 
maintenance and operating expenses, and others, that would be necessary in the 
determination of the justness of the market rates, would require trial on the 
merits if proper judgment is to be resolved by the court a quo.
