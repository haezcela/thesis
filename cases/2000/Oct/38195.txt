RESPONDENTS.

MENDOZA, J.:


This is a petition for review on 
certiorari
 of the decision of the 
Court of Appeals
[1]
 dated September 26, 
1997 which reversed and set aside the decision of the Regional Trial Court, 
Branch 20, Cauayan, Isabela dismissing the complaint filed by respondents 
against petitioner. The facts are as follows:


The late Nieves Tolentino-Rivera (Nieves for short) and her husband, Pablo 
Rivera, were married in 1921. The couple resided at Cauayan, Isabela and begot 
13 children. On October 20, 1934, Nieves, still using her maiden name, filed an 
application for a sales patent over a 13.5267-hectare land in Cauayan, Isabela. 
Her application was approved and, after payment of the purchase price, Nieves 
was issued Sales Patent No. V-119 on March 24, 1948.
[2]
 Thereafter, on March 29, 1948, OCT No. 
P-216 was issued in the name of "Nieves Tolentino, married to Pablo Rivera."


On August 15, 1949, Pablo Rivera and Nieves Tolentino sold to petitioner 
Isabela Colleges, then newly-founded, four hectares of the land covered by OCT 
No. P-216. The sale is evidenced by a deed of sale (Exh. 1) signed by both 
Nieves Tolentino and Pablo Rivera, with Francisca R. Reyes, a member of 
petitioner's board of trustees, and Cecilia L. Ramos, its librarian, as 
witnesses. The deed was notarized by Justice of the Peace Gaudencio R. Litao, 
but it was not registered with the Register of Deeds.


Petitioner Isabela Colleges immediately occupied the land and used the same 
as its new campus. One hectare was used for school buildings, two for an 
athletics field, and the remainder was reserved for future projects. Starting 
1950, the Isabela Colleges declared the land for tax purposes, but it did not 
immediately secure a separate title to the property. Its president, Dr. Pura 
Toledo, explained that the school did not then have enough money to have the 
land surveyed. The Isabela Colleges secured title to the land only on January 
13, 1970 when TCT No. 45890 was issued in its name.


After the death of Pablo Rivera on December 2, 1955, Nieves filed a petition 
in the Court of First Instance of Isabela for the amendment of OCT No. P-216 to 
reflect the change in her civil status from "married to Pablo Rivera" to 
"widow." Her petition was granted and OCT No. P-216 was accordingly amended.


In December 1976, the Office of the Register of Deeds of Isabela was burned. 
Among the titles destroyed was TCT No. 45890 in the name of the Isabela 
Colleges. The title was administratively reconstituted in 1978.


In 1980, Nieves went to the United States. Upon her return to the Philippines 
in 1988, she filed a petition for the reconstitution of OCT No. P-216 and the 
annulment of an illegally reconstituted original of OCT No. P-216 obtained by a 
certain Paulino while Nieves was abroad. Both petitions were granted by the 
trial court. The Register of Deeds of Isabela was ordered to reconstitute the 
original OCT No. P-216 in the name of Nieves. The decision of trial court was 
affirmed by the Court of Appeals in 1993.


In January 1988, Pablo Rivera Jr., George Lucero, Danilo de la Cruz, Alex 
Cortez, Proceso Cortez, Olga R. Bunag, Corazon Menor, and Carlos Calderon, some 
of whom are the respondents in this case, entered the property bought by Isabela 
Colleges, prompting the latter to bring an action for forcible entry against 
them. In February 1991, the Municipal Trial Court of Cauayan, Isabela rendered a 
decision ordering the intruders to vacate the land in question. This decision 
became final and executory.


In 1991, Nieves brought the present suit against the Isabela Colleges for 
"Nullity of Titles, Deeds of Sale, Recovery of Ownership and Possession, 
Cancellation of Titles, Damages with Preliminary Injunction." Nieves alleged: 
(1) that she was the exclusive owner of a parcel of land which had an area of 
13.5267 hectares and was covered by OCT No. P-216 issued in her name by the 
Register of Deeds of Isabela; (2) that sometime in 1950, petitioner Isabela 
Colleges occupied four hectares of her land, allegedly by virtue of a sale 
between petitioner and her husband Pablo Rivera; (3) that the deed of sale 
between the Isabela Colleges and Pablo Rivera was void because the land sold was 
her paraphernal property and the sale was made without her knowledge and 
consent; and (4) that TCT No. T-45890, which was issued on August 29, 1978 in 
the name of the Isabela Colleges, was fake and spurious. Nieves prayed that the 
sale be declared void, that the title of the Isabela Colleges be cancelled, and 
that she be placed in possession of the subject property.


In its Answer,
[3]
 the Isabela Colleges 
asserted that the property in question had been sold to it with the knowledge 
and consent of Nieves Tolentino who in fact signed the deed of sale. The 
issuance of TCT No. T-45890 in its name enjoys the presumption of regularity. 
Noting that Nieves' complaint in 1991 was filed 42 years after the questioned 
sale took place in 1949, the Isabela Colleges contended that the complaint was 
barred by prescription and/or laches.


At the pre-trial conference, the parties agreed to limit the issues to the 
following:


Is the land in question consisting of four hectares paraphernal or 
not?


Is the signature of Nieves Tolentino in the Deed of Sale dated August 15, 
1949 forged or not?


Is the cause of action of the plaintiff barred by prescription and/or 
laches; and


The losing party will pay to the prevailing party damages by way of 
attorney's fees and costs in the amount of P10,000.00.
[4]
 


Two complaints-in-intervention were allowed by the trial court. One was filed 
by Proceso Cortez,
[5]
 and the other was 
by the group of Danilo de la Cruz, George Lucero, Alexander Cortez, Corazon 
Menor, Olga R. Bunag, and Carlos Calderon. The intervenors claimed to be either 
buyers in good faith or lessees of Nieves as to certain portions of the subject 
land. These parties were the defendants in the ejectment case filed by 
petitioner in 1988.


In March 1992, alleging that her signature in the questioned deed of sale had 
been forged, Nieves filed a motion asking that the deed be submitted to the 
National Bureau of Investigation for a determination of the authenticity of her 
signature. The motion was granted by the trial court, but examination of the 
document was not made as Nieves subsequently withdrew her motion.


Nieves' deposition was ordered taken as she was then already 88 years old and 
unable to walk. In fact, before petitioner's counsel could finish her 
cross-examination, Nieves died on January 15, 1993. She was substituted by her 
heirs, herein respondents Pablo Rivera, Jr., Felicula R. Perez, Dolores R. 
Querido, Olga R. Bunag, Lolita A. Rivera, Lucia R. Flores, Manuel T. Rivera, 
Andres T. Rivera, Camilo T. Rivera, Emma R. Alfonso, and Antonia R. Perez.


On September 30, 1994, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive 
portion of which reads:




WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the defendant Isabela 
Colleges and against the plaintiffs heirs of Nieves Tolentino, namely, Pablo 
Rivera, Jr., Felicula R. Perez, Dolores R. Querido, Olga R. Bunag, Lolita A. 
Rivera, Lucia R. Flores, Manuel T. Rivera, Andres T. Rivera, Camilo T. Rivera, 
Emma R. Alfonso and Antonia R. Perez, (1) dismissing the complaint; (2) 
declaring the deed of sale dated August 15, 1949 and the titles of the defendant 
Isabela Colleges valid; (3) declaring the defendant Isabela Colleges owner of 
the land in question which is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 
T-45890 and the titles of the land as subdivided (Exhs. "9" to "34"); (4) 
ordering the plaintiffs Heirs of Nieves Tolentino to pay to the defendant 
P10,000.00; (5) ordering the plaintiffs Heirs of Nieves Tolentino to pay to the 
Intervenor and cross-claimant Proceso J. Cortez, Sixty Seven Thousand 
(P67,000.00) representing the purchase price of the lots he purchased from 
Nieves Tolentino; and (6) ordering all the plaintiffs and intervenors to vacate 
the land in question and remove all their buildings and other improvements 
thereon it being understood that this decision will not in any way interfere 
with the execution of the decision of the Municipal Trial Court of Cauayan, 
Isabela, in 
Civil Case No. 1469, entitled, Isabela Colleges vs. Pablo Rivera, 
Jr., et al.
 Let a copy of this decision be annotated at the back of Original 
Certificate of Title No. P-216. Costs against the plaintiffs and 
intervenors.


SO ORDERED.
[6]
 


On appeal, its decision was reversed. In its decision rendered on September 
26, 1997, the Court of Appeals ruled:


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed 
from is hereby 
REVERSED
 and
 SET ASIDE,
 and a 
new one rendered, to wit:


Declaring the plaintiffs-appellants as the lawful owners of the property in 
question;


Declaring null and void and canceling Transfer Certificate of Title No. 
45890 as well as the subsequent Transfer Certificates of Titles proceeding 
therefrom, of the Register of Deeds of Isabela, covering the real property 
described therein in the name of defendant-appellee Isabela Colleges, 
Inc.;


Ordering defendant-appellee Isabela Colleges to execute the necessary deed 
of reconveyance of the aforesaid real property to the plaintiffs;


Ordering defendant-appellee Isabela Colleges to indemnify plaintiffs in the 
sum of P50,000.00 as and for attorney's fees;


Appellant intervenor and cross-claimant Proceso J. Cortez is hereby declared 
owner and entitled to the possession of an aggregate area of three hundred 
seventy (370) square meters, covered by Exhibits "E", "F" and "G"; and


Ordering defendant-appellee Isabela Colleges to pay the costs of the suit. 





SO ORDERED.
[7]
 


Hence, this petition. Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals erred in 
ruling that: (1) the subject property is paraphernal despite Nieves' admission 
that it was purchased from the government during her marriage with Pablo Rivera 
out of conjugal funds; (2) Nieves' signature in the questioned deed of sale is 
forged; and (3) laches cannot defeat the claim of a registered property owner 
despite the long delay of 41 years.
[8]




First
. The Court of Appeals ruled that the four-hectare land subject 
of the 1949 sale is paraphernal property based on Nieves Tolentino's deposition 
that she occupied the 13-hectare land (which eventually was covered by OCT No. 
P-216 in her name) and applied for a sales patent thereon when she was single. 
However, her deposition shows that while Nieves initially claimed that she 
applied for a sales patent when she was still single, she later admitted that 
she filed her application for a sales patent in 1934, more than ten years after 
her marriage to Pablo Rivera in 1921. Thus, she stated:








Q: 




Why did you place in your application that you were 
single?




A: 




Yes, sir. 




Q: 




Why did you place in your application that you were single 
when in fact you were already married? 




A: 




Yes, sir, because when I applied I was still single. 





Q:




Why, what year was it when you applied for the sales 
patent of this parcel of land? 




A: 




I could not remember anymore, sir. 




Q: 




According to your Exhibit V here dated February 2, 1947, in 
your letter to the Honorable Director of Lands, sub-paragraph 1 and I read, 
"That the undersigned petitioner for the application of Sales Application 19281 
covering a piece of land consisting of 14.2800 hectares" filed on October 20, 
1934 and acknowledged by the Bureau of Lands on November 2, 1934.
 It appears 
that you filed this sales application on October 20, 1934, is this correct? 





 


 




ATTY. ALBANO: 




 


May we ask that the document be presented to the deponent, in your Honor, 
for referral. 




 


 




DEPOSITION OFFICER: 




 




The deponent may read the document for referral purposes, to 
refresh her memory.




 


 




NIEVES RIVERA: 




 


Yes, sir, that is correct. 




 


 




ATTY. RAMIREZ: 




Q: 


And so you filed this application more than ten years after you were 
married to Pablo Rivera, Sr.? 




A:


That is correct, sir.
[9]




In any case, the date of the sales patent application is irrelevant for that 
fact alone would not vest in her ownership over the subject land. 


Neither is Nieves Tolentino's allegation that she was already in possession 
of the land even before her marriage to Pablo Rivera in 1921 material. The land 
was acquired through sales patent under Commonwealth Act No. 141,
[10]
 and not through prescription or any other 
mode of acquiring ownership.


Under C.A. No. 141, her application must be approved and the purchase price 
paid before Nieves Tolentino could be granted a sales patent and issued a 
certificate of title. It is undisputed that Nieves Tolentino was issued a sales 
patent only on March 24, 1948, after she had complied with the foregoing 
requirements. The land in question was thus acquired during her marriage to 
Pablo Rivera.


Both the acquisition of the 13-hectare land and the sale of a portion thereof 
to petitioner in 1949 took place when the Spanish Civil Code was still in 
effect. Under Article 1407 of that Code, the property of the spouses are deemed 
conjugal partnership property in the absence of proof that it belongs 
exclusively to one or the other spouse. This presumption arises with respect to 
property acquired during the marriage. It is not necessary to prove that the 
property was acquired with conjugal funds.
[11]
 


To overthrow this presumption, the evidence to the contrary must be strong, 
clear, and convincing. The registration alone of the subject land in the name of 
Nieves Tolentino is insufficient to rebut the presumption. Nor is there clear 
and convincing proof that the funds used in purchasing the four-hectare land 
subject of the sale belonged exclusively to her. Nieves' own deposition on this 
question is vague and contradictory. Although she claimed that she used her 
exclusive funds to pay for the land, she also said that the funds used came from 
the proceeds of the sale of 
palay
 which they produced from the subject 
land. Thus, in her deposition, Nieves stated:








Q: 




My question now is who paid for the purchase consideration of 
your sales application on this land? 




A:


I was the one, sir. 




Q: 


Where did you get the money that you paid? 




A: 


From the proceeds of the palay that I sold, sir. 




Q:


Where did you produce the palay? 




A:


We were tilling that land, sir. 




Q: 


What land did you till? 




A: 


This land, sir.
[12]


It thus appears that the land was cultivated and tilled by the family, and 
that the funds used in buying the land had been derived out of the proceeds of 
this joint industry. Under Art. 1401 (2) of the Spanish Civil Code, property 
obtained by the industry, wages or work of the spouses or either of them, among 
others, belong to the conjugal partnership.


Indeed, other than its finding that Nieves Tolentino was already in 
possession of the land and applied for a sales patent before she married Pablo 
Rivera, the Court of Appeals cited no other evidence to prove that the land was 
her paraphernal property. On the contrary, the evidence clearly shows that the 
land was acquired during the marriage of Nieves Tolentino and Pablo Rivera. It 
is thus presumed to be conjugal property and respondents' evidence fails to 
rebut this presumption.


Second
. Having established that the land covered by OCT No. P-216 from 
which had come the four-hectare portion purchased by petitioner is conjugal 
property, we shall now consider the validity of the sale.


In contending that the sale is void, Nieves Tolentino argued that the land 
sold was her paraphernal property and that the sale was done without her consent 
because her signature in the deed of sale is a forgery. We are convinced that 
Nieves Tolentino's signature in the deed of sale was forged. We quote with 
approval the following findings of the Court of Appeals, to wit:




Apart from the foregoing circumstances, it appears in the questioned document 
itself a convincing piece of physical evidence which establishes beyond any 
doubt that the signature therein purporting to be that of Nieves Tolentino was 
not written by the latter but by a different hand. A closer look at the 
questioned signature would show that it is merely copied from the original 
signature of the late Nieves Tolentino. The difference is discernible to the 
naked eye. In the questioned signature, there is a loop stroke that started at 
letter "O" and looping further or whirling further to letter "T" and extended in 
between letter "I" and letter "N" in the family name Tolentino. Likewise, all 
the specimen signatures of the late Nieves Tolentino which she identified during 
the deposition to be hers, consisting of several documents executed by her 
during her lifetime, were written in a slanting position: whereas, the 
questioned signature was entirely written in a straight manner. . . . .


The trial court likewise erred in disregarding the testimony of Attorney 
Romulo Gines. The said lawyer testified that the signature "NIEVES TOLENTINO" in 
the questioned Deed of Sale is not the signature of Nieves Tolentino because of 
the flourish in the "T" and "O" which are absent in the other signatures of 
Nieves Tolentino. That he is familiar with the signature of Nieves Tolentino as 
he has seen her sign documents for at least fifty (50) times. The trial court 
rejected his testimony on account that he did not present sufficient number of 
documents to prove his claim and that the documents he saw which Nieves 
Tolentino allegedly signed were executed long after 1949. Moreover, he is 
disqualified to testify since he is not a handwriting expert.


Again, we disagree. The court 
a quo
 failed to consider that what Atty. 
Romulo testified to is that he was familiar with the signature of Nieves 
Tolentino as he saw her signed several documents in his presence, he being the 
lawyer of the said Nieves Tolentino for a long time. Such testimony is more than 
enough to establish the signature as a forgery.


Section 23, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court, provides:




Sec. 23. Handwriting, how proved. - The handwriting of a person 
may be 
proved by any witness who believes it to be the handwriting of such person, and 
has seen the person write, or has seen writing purporting to be his upon which 
the witness has acted or has been charged, and has thus acquired knowledge of 
the handwriting of such person.
 Evidence respecting the handwriting may also 
be given by a comparison made by the witness or the court with writings admitted 
or treated as genuine by the party against whom the evidence is offered, or 
proved to be genuine to the satisfaction of the judge." (Emphasis 
supplied)


In the case at bar, Atty. Gines acquired familiarity of the signature of the 
deceased, Nieves Tolentino, since he has been the lawyer of Nieves Tolentino for 
a long time and he has seen her sign several documents in his presence.
[13]
 


The fact that Nieves Tolentino's signature in the deed of sale is a forgery 
does not, however, render the deed of sale void. For the land was conjugal 
property and, under the Spanish Civil Code, the wife's consent to the sale is 
not required. Therefore, that her signature is a forgery is determinative only 
of Nieves Tolentino's lack of consent but not of the validity of the sale. Art. 
1413 of the Spanish Civil Code provides:




In addition to his powers as manager the husband may for valuable 
consideration alienate and encumber the property of the conjugal partnership 
without the consent of the wife.


Nevertheless, no alienation or agreement which the husband may make with 
respect to such property in contravention of this Code or in fraud of the wife 
shall prejudice her or her heirs.


As the husband may validly sell or dispose of conjugal property even without 
the wife's consent, the absence of the wife's consent alone does not make the 
sale "in fraud" of her. 


Third
. The Court of Appeals ruled that, notwithstanding the lapse of 
42 years, respondents' action was not barred by prescription and/or laches. The 
Court of Appeals held that since the subject land is registered, the title 
covering the same is indefeasible and imprescriptible. On the other hand, laches 
is inapplicable because the same cannot be used to perpetrate a fraud.
[14]
 


We disagree. The law provides that no title to registered land in derogation 
of that of the registered owner can be acquired by prescription or adverse 
possession.
[15]
 Nonetheless, while it is 
true that a Torrens title is indefeasible and imprescriptible,
[16]
 the registered landowner may lose his 
right to recover the possession of his registered property by reason of 
laches.
[17]
 


Laches means the failure or neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained 
length of time to do that which, by observance of due diligence, could or should 
have been done earlier. It is negligence or omission to assert a right within a 
reasonable time, warranting the presumption that the party entitled to assert 
his right either has abandoned or declined to assert it.
[18]
 Laches thus operates as a bar in 
equity.
[19]
 


Thus, in 
Catholic Bishop of Balanga v. Court of Appeals
,
[20]
 a parcel of registered land was donated 
by its owner in 1936. After the donee had been in possession of the land, 
adversely, continuously, publicly, and peacefully for 49 years, the registered 
owner filed an action to recover the property on the ground that the donation 
was invalid. The trial court ruled in favor of the registered owner and ordered 
the donee to vacate the land. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial 
court and ruled that the complaint for recovery of possession was barred by 
laches. We affirmed the Court of Appeals as follows:




The time-honored rule anchored on public policy is that relief will be denied 
to a litigant whose claim or demand has become "stale," or who has acquiesced 
for an unreasonable length of time, or who has not been vigilant or who has 
slept on his rights either by negligence, folly or inattention. In other words, 
public policy requires, for peace of society, the discouragement of claims grown 
stale for non-assertion; thus laches is an impediment to the assertion or 
enforcement of a right which has become, under the circumstances, inequitable or 
unfair to permit.


. . . .


In applying the doctrine of laches, we had ruled that where a party allows 
the following number of years to lapse from the emergence of his cause of 
action, before instituting court action to enforce his claim, such action would 
be barred by the equitable defense of laches: 36 years, 12 years, 50 years, 34 
years, 37 years. 32 years, 20 years, 47 years, 11 years, 25 years, 40 years, 19 
years, 27 years, 7 years, 44 years, 4 years, and 67 years.


. . . .


In this case, petitioner filed its complaint in court only after forty-nine 
(49) years had lapsed since the donation in its behalf of the subject property 
to private respondent's predecessor-in-interest. There is nary an explanation 
for the long delay in the filing by petitioner of the complaint in the case at 
bench, and that inaction for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time 
constitutes laches. 
As such, petitioner cannot claim nullity of the donation 
as an excuse to avoid the consequences of its own unjustified inaction and as a 
basis for the assertion of a right on which they had slept for so long
.
[21]


So it is in the present case where the complaint questioning the validity of 
the sale to petitioner Isabela Colleges was filed only after 42 years had 
lapsed. Respondents could not feign ignorance of the sale because petitioner had 
been in open, public, and continuous possession of the land which it had used as 
its school campus since 1949. Nieves Tolentino claimed in her deposition that 
she and her husband Pablo Rivera intended to donate the land to the Isabela 
Colleges in exchange for their children's free education, and that she started 
suspecting that her husband had broken their agreement when the Isabela Colleges 
charged them tuition fees. She further claimed that, after some investigation, 
she discovered that Pablo Rivera had sold the land to the Isabela Colleges. Yet, 
despite her discovery, she did not bring her action against petitioner until 
1991, taking her 42 years before finally doing so. No reason had been given to 
explain her delay.


Indeed, even if the sale to petitioner was made in bad faith, laches would 
nonetheless apply. In 
Claveria v. Quingco,
[22]
 
notwithstanding the fact that the 
buyer had acted in bad faith because he knew that the vendor was not the 
registered owner, it was held that the registered owner's inaction for 36 years 
had definitely foreclosed his right to recover the property. 


Fourth
. Proceso Cortez filed a complaint-in-intervention claiming 
ownership over two parcels of land with an aggregate area of 370 square meters 
by virtue of a sale between him and Nieves Tolentino in 1988. He initially 
alleged that the lots were included in the four-hectare land covered by TCT No. 
45890 of petitioner Isabela Colleges. On appeal, however, he asserted that these 
lots were located outside petitioner's land. He claimed to be a buyer in good 
faith.


Even assuming that Cortez was not guilty of bad faith when he bought the land 
in question, the fact remains that the Isabela Colleges was first in possession. 
Art. 1544 of the Civil Code on double sales provides:




If the same thing should have been sold to different vendees, the ownership 
shall be transferred to the person who may have first taken possession thereof 
in good faith, if it should be movable property.


Should it be immovable property, the ownership shall belong to the person 
acquiring it who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of 
Property.


Should there be no inscription, the ownership shall pertain to the person who 
in good faith was first in the possession; and, in the absence thereof, to the 
person who presents the oldest title, provided there is good 
faith.


Indeed, petitioner has been in possession of the land since 1949. Between 
petitioner and Cortez, therefore, the former had a better right for the latter
