QUISUMBING, J.:


This petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeks 
the reversal of the Decision dated December 15, 1994 and the Resolution dated 
July 21, 1995 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 28171 which reversed the 
decision of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Branch 12, in Sp. Proc. No. 
417-CEB.


In its decision, the appellate court decreed as follows: 




"WHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari is GRANTED. The orders dated November 
15, 1991, January 13, 1992 and February 25, 1992 are declared null and void. The 
Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of private respondents Felix Uy Chua, Robert 
Iping Chua and Richard Uy Chua are declared null and void. The Deed of Absolute 
Sale dated April 15, 1991 executed by the Administratrix in favor of petitioner 
Sofia O. Sanchez is declared valid and binding upon the parties. The order dated 
May 3, 1991 approving the Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 15, 1991 is AFFIRMED 
AND REINSTATED.


SO ORDERED."
[1]
 


The facts of the case, based on the records, are as follows: Fernando B. 
Morada owned Lot 832-B-1-C-2 located in Cebu City. His only heirs were his wife, 
Aida N. Morada, and two minor children. After his death, the probate court 
presided by Judge Leoncio P. Abarquez appointed Aida as administratrix of her 
husband's estate. On July 20, 1984, the probate court allowed the sale of the 
lot for P200,000.00 to the spouses Precioso and Consolacion Enriquez. Later, the 
spouses and Aida agreed to rescind the said sale. On January 20, 1988, the 
probate court again issued an order allowing the re-sale of said lot, the 
proceeds of which shall be used to pay the P200,000.00 already paid by the 
Enriquez spouses. On April 15, 1991, a Deed of Absolute Sale thereof was 
executed in favor of Sofia Sanchez, herein private respondent, for one million 
pesos (P1,000,000.00) payable with a down payment of P500,000.00 and the balance 
to be paid after the lot was cleared of squatters.
[2]
 On May 7, 1991, the court, after approving 
the sale to Sanchez,
[3]
 directed Aida to 
submit an accounting within thirty days, deposit the proceeds of the sale in a 
reputable bank in Cebu, and then inform the court of the name of the bank where 
the money was deposited.


On July 16, 1991, after more than two months from the date of approval of the 
sale, Intervenor Sagrario Morelos, filed a motion for reconsideration opposing 
the sale alleging that the sale was prejudicial to the minor heirs of Fernando. 
He claimed that the lot could be sold for P1.5 million pesos. Judge Abarquez 
held a conference in chambers attended by Aida and her counsel Atty. Recto de 
Dios, Atty. Rodolfo M. Morelos, counsel of Sagrario Morelos, and Atty. Federico 
Cabilao, another intervenor who represented undisclosed clients interested to 
purchase the land. During the conference, Atty. Cabilao revealed that he offered 
P2 million pesos for the lot with the seller undertaking the eviction of the 
present occupants, or P1.5 million with the buyer shouldering the expenses to 
clear the lot of its present occupants. Aida objected to Atty. Cabilao's 
statement. She explained that the latter's offer was made only after the sale to 
Sanchez was already approved by the court.


On August 6, 1991 Atty. Cabilao, on instructions of Judge Abarquez, filed his 
Proposal to Purchase the Property. In her comment and opposition to the proposal 
of Atty. Cabilao, Aida Morada said that the court's order approving the sale to 
Sofia Sanchez had already become final and executory, and that she had bought 
the land from the administratrix in good faith and for value. She added that she 
should not suffer whatever missteps were committed by the administratrix. On 
November 15, 1991, Judge Abarquez issued an order revoking his approval of the 
sale and declared void and without effect the deed of absolute sale he had 
earlier approved. In his Order, he stated: 




"From the aforementioned facts, the Court finds that the Administratrix and 
Sanchez are both guilty of misrepresentation. On her part, the Administratrix 
deliberately concealed from the Court the fact that Sanchez had extended to her 
a loan of P300,000.00 before the execution of the Deed of Sale and that the said 
amount was already deducted by Sanchez from the down payment of P500,000.00. 
Likewise, she deliberately withheld from the Court the fact that she previously 
committed the lot in question as a guaranty for the payment of such loan of 
P300,000.00. As admitted by Sanchez in Court, she understood and was aware that 
in accordance with the terms of the Deed of Sale, she was supposed to deliver 
the P500,000.00 to the Estate thru the Administratrix on the date of the 
execution of the Deed of Sale. Under such knowledge of her corresponding 
obligation as vendee, she should have told the Court that she was to deliver 
only P200,000.00 for down payment and not P500,000.00, or she would have caused 
the insertion of a proviso to this effect in the Deed of Sale in order that the 
Court could have been properly apprised of the true circumstances of the sale. 
But she instead kept her silence obviously to eliminate any hindrance to the 
Court's approval of the Deed of Sale. Hence, Sanchez could not claim that she is 
a buyer in good faith.


From the foregoing circumstances, the conclusion is incapable that the 
Administratrix and Sanchez had a community of interest in misleading the Court, 
as a result of which, they were able to achieve the true purposes of sale which 
were, a) to surrender the lot as an indirect payment of previous loan; and b) so 
that the Administratrix could receive an additional amount of P150,000.00 which 
she planned to keep for herself. Ostensibly their consortium amounted to 
fraud.


Fraud has been defined, among others, as an inducement through insidious 
machination. Insidious machination refers to a deceitful scheme or plot with an 
evil or devious purpose. Deceit exists where the party, who obtains consent, 
does so by concealing or omitting to state MATERIAL FACTS which, with intent to 
deceive, by reason of such omission or concealment, the other party was induced 
to give his consent which he would otherwise have not given. (Strong v. 
Gutierres Repido, 213 U.S. 419; 41 Phil 947).


True it is that Sanchez had a valid credit in her favor. That such loan was 
legitimate would even be considered. But such loan, as a valid credit, should 
first be presented to the Court as an obligation of the Estate, either as an 
administration expense or as an expense for the preservation of the property. 
Only thereafter would it be paid by the Estate, according to any of the modes 
provided for by Rule 88 of the Rules of Court. The sale in question is 
apparently a contrivance availed of by the Administratrix and Sanchez as a 
surreptitious liquidation of the loan of the Administratrix, in the guise of an 
account of the Estate, taking a shortcut of the legal requirements provided for 
by the Rules of Court. It is a general rule that notwithstanding the presence of 
a valid consideration, a contract is considered to be stained with fraud if 
there is no bona fide intent. Both valid consideration and bona fide intent must 
exist. If lacking in any of these particulars the contract is voidable.


Moreover, the procedure jointly resorted to by the Administratrix and by 
Sanchez was tantamount to a foreclosure of their loose mortgage agreement, a 
procedure that is not allowed to take place in a probate court.


While it may be correct that the Intervenor, who is either an heir, devisee 
or legatee to the will, has no personality to intervene in probate proceedings, 
once the Court's attention is called upon to remedy a situation where the 
interest of justice is affected, the Court must institute just remedial 
measures, on its own accord. Its corresponding action thereto is well within its 
inherent power to amend its order so as to make it conformable to law and 
justice.


The Court finds no merit in the contention of Sanchez that the annulment of 
the sale would create an instability of probate proceedings. Since the Court's 
action in annulling the sale in question is impelled by its own duty to right a 
wrong, such action, on the contrary, would give more strength to the probate 
mechanism."
[4]
 .


Almost immediately after his order, Judge Abarquez also approved the proposal 
of Atty. Cabilao to purchase the property for P1.5 million. However, on December 
5, 1991, before Judge Abarquez inhibited himself and before the case was 
re-raffled to Branch 12, the Branch Clerk of Court, Branch 19, issued a 
certification that the Order dated November 15, 1991 of Judge Abarquez declaring 
the Deed of Sale dated April 15, 1991 executed by Aida Morada in favor of Sofia 
Sanchez was void and without effect; and that the Order dated November 15, 1991 
approving the sale to Atty. Cabilao issued by Judge Abarquez had become final 
and executory since there was no motion for reconsideration filed by the parties 
and no appeal was taken therefrom.
[5]
 
Atty. Cabilao then filed a motion for execution.


On January 13, 1992, Judge Portia AliÃ±o-Hormachuelos, presiding over Branch 
12 where the case was re-raffled, issued an Omnibus Order granting the motion 
for execution and dismissing the urgent motion of Sanchez. The Order stated:




"WHEREFORE, considering that the order sought to be executed has become final 
and executory, the offeror's urgent motion for execution dated December 18, 1991 
(p. 109, Ibid) is hereby granted. Atty. Federico Cabilao is hereby ordered to 
prepare, for the approval [of] the court, the corresponding Deed of Sale to be 
signed for and in behalf of the Estate by the Clerk of Court, Atty. Nicolas 
Jomuad, pursuant to sec. 10. Rule 39, Rules of Court, it appearing to be 
unlikely that the administratrix will appear before the court to execute the 
Deed of Sale having failed to comply with her promise to do so as contained in 
the Order dated December 12, 1991 (p. 115, Record).


The Manifestation and the Urgent Motion filed by Mrs. Sofia Sanchez is hereby 
dismissed.


SO ORDERED."
[6]
 


On January 29, 1992, Sanchez filed a motion for reconsideration and made a 
counter-offer of P1.6 million, a hundred thousand pesos more than the amount 
offered by Atty. Cabilao. The motion was denied in an order dated February 25, 
1992. The court said that the Order approving the sale to Atty. Cabilao had 
become final and executory and that the counter offer was not a compelling 
reason for the court to vacate its order. As it turned out, the property was 
bought by Felix Uy Chua, Roberto Iping Chua and Richard Uy Chua, the clients of 
Atty. Cabilao who are now petitioners before this Court.


Sanchez filed a petition for 
certiorari
 before the Court of Appeals 
alleging that respondent Judges Abarquez and AliÃ±o-Hormachelos abused their 
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when they issued the questioned 
orders dated November 15, 1991, January 13, 1992 and February 25, 1992.


As earlier stated, the appellate court granted the petition in favor of 
private respondent Sanchez and the Deed of Absolute Sale in her favor was 
affirmed and reinstated. Reconsideration was denied. Hence, the instant 
petition, alleging that the appellate court committed the following errors:




"1. THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT DEPARTED FROM THE ACCEPTED AND 
USUAL COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS WHEN IT GRANTED PRIVATE RESPONDENT'S 
PETITION FOR CERTIORARI FILED UNDER RULE 65 AFTER MORE THAN 6 MONTHS HAD ELAPSED 
SINCE HER RECEIPT OF THE ORDER COMPLAINED OF AND AFTER MORE THAN 5 MONTHS AFTER 
SAID ORDER WAS CERTIFIED AS FINAL AND EXECUTORY.


2. THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN NULLIFYING A FINAL AND EXECUTED 
ORDER OF A PROBATE COURT ISSUED AFTER SUMMARY HEARING AND EVIDENCE OF FRAUD WAS 
UNEARTHED AND AFTER PRIVATE RESPONDENT THRU NEGLIGENCE OR INDIFFERENCE LOST THE 
PRIVILEGE TO APPEAL WHERE SUCH AN APPEAL WAS THE ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE REMEDY 
IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LAW.


3. THE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED WITH MANIFEST PARTIALITY AND BEYOND THE BOUNDS 
OF SOUND DISCRETION WHEN IT RENDERED THE QUESTIONED JUDGMENT PREMISED ON 
MISAPPREHENSION OF FACTS, OR A SUPPOSED ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE BUT IS CONTRADICTED 
BY EVIDENCE OF RECORD."
[7]




First, petitioners challenge the appellate court's decision to reinstate the 
sale of Lot 832 in favor of Sanchez arguing that the November 15, 1991 order 
approving the sale to them had become final and executory. Ironically, it is the 
same argument private respondent used to plead her claim, that the much earlier 
May 3, 1991 order of Judge Abarquez approving the sale to her had become final 
and executory. Ironically too, both rely on the same doctrine enunciated in 

Pan Realty Corporation vs. Court of Appeals
[8]
 where we ruled, "




...[T]he order of the Probate Court authorizing, or subsequently approving, 
the absolute sale of property of the estate in favor of a specified buyer 
undoubtedly constitutes a final determination of the rights not only of the 
buyer and the estate but also of any heir or party claiming to be prejudiced by 
the sale. For obviously
, once the sale is consummated and approved by the 
Court, the buyer will acquire title to the property to the exclusion of the 
estate and the heirs or other party participating or otherwise involved in the 
proceedings for settlement of the estate, unless the authority to sell or the 
approval of the sale by the Court be reversed seasonably and by the proper 
adjective mode.
 After its approval of the sale, nothing is left to be done 
by the Probate Court with respect to the merits thereof; and it is thus in this 
sense, a final order `subject to appeal' pursuant to Sec. 2, Rule 41 of the 
Rules of Court."
[9]
 


It will be recalled that the probate court declared the sale to Sanchez, null 
and void due to fraud and misrepresentation, then it entertained the offer of 
Atty. Cabilao to purchase the property at a higher price. The Court of Appeals 
ruled that the sale of the property to Atty. Cabilao was void because 
the 
court was already without jurisdiction
 to enter the same after the sale to 
Sanchez, which was previously approved by the same court, was consummated and 
the intervenors failed to seasonably appeal therefrom.


Section 1, Rule 109 of the Rules of Court
[10]
 provides that an interested person may 
appeal from an order or judgment rendered by the probate court where such order 
constitutes the settlement of the estate of a deceased person. In the case 
before us, the probate court approved the Deed of Sale in favor of Sanchez on 
May 3, 1991. In special proceedings under Rule 109 of the Rules of Court and in 
other cases where multiple appeals are allowed, the period of appeal is thirty 
days. A record on appeal is required.
[11]
 
Recall that Atty. Rodolfo M. Morelos did not appeal but filed a motion for 
reconsideration only on July 16, 1991, while Atty. Cabilao intervened and 
offered to buy the property on August 6, 1991. By then, the sale of the property 
to Sanchez was already consummated and final. When the probate court allowed 
Atty. Cabilao to propose to buy the land and allowed the sale to the latter, the 
probate court, at this juncture, had clearly gravely abused its discretion. All 
other proceedings thereafter were conducted by the probate court without 
jurisdiction including the erroneous nullification of the sale to Sanchez and 
the subsequent sale to petitioners. The Court of Appeals, therefore did not err 
in its order nullifying and voiding the orders dated November 15, 1991, January 
13, 1992 and February 25, 1992.


Additionally, the belated proposal to buy the property was filed by an 
offeror, Atty. Federico Cabilao, who had no legal personality to impugn the 
validity of the sale between the administratrix and Sanchez. In 
CFI of Rizal, 
Br. IX vs. Court of Appeals
,
[12]


when an intervenor-offeror sought to annul a private sale duly authorized by 
the probate court, this Court said: "




. . . It is well settled that for a person to be able to intervene in an 
administration proceeding concerning the estate of a deceased person, 
it is 
necessary for him to have an interest in such estate. An interested party in the 
estate of a decedent has been defined as one who would be benefited by the 
estate, such as an heir, or one who has a claim against the estate, such as a 
creditor
 (Saguinsin vs. Lindayag, 116 Phil. 1193)."
[13]
 


Atty. Cabilao was neither a creditor nor an heir of the decedent. He had no 
right to intervene in the probate hearings nor in the settlement of the 
succession. As correctly observed by the Court of Appeals: 




"x x x In this case, the only heirs of the late Fernando B. Morada are his 
surviving spouse, Administratrix Aida N. Morada and their two (2) minor 
children. Intervenor Sagrario Morelos and Atty. Federico Cabilao are not heirs, 
devisees and legatees of the deceased Fernando B. Morada. Under Section 2 of 
Rule 89 of the Revised Rules of Court, both Morelos and Atty. Cabilao are not 
entitled to notice of the orders of the court on the sale of the subject 
property, not being heirs, devisees and legatees of the late Fernando Morada. 
The record of this case shows that Administratrix Aida Morada thru her counsel 
received the order of May 3, 1991 on May 7, 1991. . . . [T]he order dated May 3, 
1991 became final and executory. It was no longer subject to a motion for 
reconsideration nor an appeal therefrom. It is thus clear that respondent Judge 
Abarquez had no more jurisdiction to alter or annul the order of May 3, 1991 
when he entertained the motion for reconsideration that was filed by Intervenor 
Morelos on July 23, 1991 and the `Proposal to Purchase Property' that was filed 
by Atty. Federico Cabilao on August 6, 1991. These two (2) papers or `pleadings' 
were filed more than two (2) months after the order dated May 3, 1991 had become 
final and executory."
[14]


Second, petitioners contend the respondent court erred when it disregarded 
the finding of the trial court that there was fraud. The probate court, on its 
own, concluded there was connivance between Aida and Sanchez in not disclosing 
to the court that Aida owed money from Sanchez and that the loan was to be paid 
from the proceeds of the sale. On this matter, Section 5 of Rule 8 is pertinent. 
The rule states:




"Sec. 5. 
Fraud, mistake, condition of the mind -- In all 

averments
 of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or 
mistake 
must be stated with particularity.
 Malice, intent, knowledge or 
other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally."
[15]
 


Fraud must be both alleged and proven, it is never presumed.
[16]
 Fraud and mistake must be averred to 
enable the opposing party to controvert the particular facts allegedly 
constituting the same. Affidavits must show the fraud, accident, mistake or 
excusable negligence relied upon. The Court of Appeals noted that fraud was not 
stated specifically in the pleadings, either in the motion for reconsideration 
by Morelos or in the proposal to buy the property by Atty. Cabilao.


While a sale by an administrator of the personal property of the estate, 
without the authority of an order of court, or of a will, or under an order of 
court is void for want of jurisdiction, and does not confer on the purchaser a 
title,
[17]
 in this case, the probate 
court was not unaware of the loan from Sanchez and the agreement that part of 
the proceeds of the sale will be applied to the loan. In fact, the probate court 
had full knowledge that part of the proceeds of the sale to Sanchez was to be 
used to reimburse the Enriquez spouses for P200,000.00. In its order dated 
November 15, 1991 the probate court acknowledged that it issued an order dated 
January 20, 1988 allowing the re-sale so the Enriquez spouses could be 
reimbursed.
[18]
 In our view, this 
improperly alleged and unproved "fraud" cannot be the basis of the probate court 
for nullifying the sale to Sanchez after it had already become final and 
executory.


Petitioners argue that private respondent, by filing a motion for 
reconsideration and making a counter-offer of P1.6 million against petitioner's 
P1.5 million, waived whatever rights she had acquired under the deed of sale in 
her favor and had in effect consented to the re-opening of the sale. They aver 
that Sanchez by so doing is now estopped from raising the validity and finality 
of the sale to her. We need not delve on this disingenuous proposition. As we 
have discussed, all proceedings before the probate court after the sale to 
Sanchez became final and executory, and after said court had lost jurisdiction, 
were null and void. All subsequent events by legal contemplation were 
non-events, immaterial to this case.


Finally, was it error to bring the case before the Court of Appeals on 
certiorari under Rule 65? Petitioners allege that the proper remedy for 
respondent was to appeal under Rule 45 under which private respondent was 
already time-barred and the Court of Appeals should not have taken cognizance of 
the petition. Petitioners misread the applicable law, Rules and precedents. A 
special civil action for 
certiorari
 challenging the RTC with grave abuse 
of discretion may be instituted either in the Court of Appeals or the Supreme 
Court. Both have original concurrent jurisdiction.
[19]
 
Certiorari
 is an extraordinary 
remedy available only when there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy or adequate 
remedy in the ordinary course of law.
[20]
 
While ordinarily, 
certiorari
 is unavailing where the appeal period has 
lapsed, there are exceptions. Among them are (a) when public welfare and the 
advancement of public policy dictates; (b) when the broader interest of justice 
so requires;
[21]
 (c) when the writs 
issued are null and void; 
(d) or when the questioned order amounts to an 
oppressive exercise of judicial authority.
[22]
 As early as 
Crisostomo vs. 
Endencia,
[23]
 
we held: "


...The remedy by certiorari may be successfully invoked both in cases wherein 
an appeal does not lie and in those wherein the right to appeal having been lost 
with or without the appellant's negligence, the court has no jurisdiction to 
issue the order or decision which is the subject matter of the remedy."
[24]
 


The questioned orders of the probate court nullifying the sale to Sanchez 
after it approved the sale and after its order of approval had become final and 
executory amount to oppressive exercise of judicial authority, a grave abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction. Further orders stemming therefrom 
are also null and without effect. 


WHEREFORE
, the instant petition for certiorari is 

DENIED
. The assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of 
Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 28171, are both AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioners.
