[ G.R. No. 114028, October 18, 2000 ]


SALVADOR SEBASTIAN, SR., petitioner, vs. HON. FRANCIS E. GARCHITORENA, HON. JOSE S. BALAJADIA, and HON. NARCISO T. ATIENZA (SANDIGANBAYAN-First Division), respondents.

DE LEON, JR., J.:




Before us is a petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65
[1]
 in conjunction with Rule XIX of the 
Revised Rules of the Sandiganbayan, seeking to annul the Resolution
[2]
 dated August 24, 1993 of the 
Sandiganbayan, First Division which admitted the sworn statements of petitioner 
Salvador Sebastian, Sr. and his co-accused in Criminal Case No. 17904 as 
evidence for the prosecution, and the Resolution dated September 27, 1993 which 
denied the motion for reconsideration of the said Resolution. 


On July 28, 1992, Special Prosecution Officer III Teresita Diaz-Baldoz filed 
with the Sandiganbayan an Information for the crime of Malversation of Public 
Funds
[3]
, as defined and penalized under 
Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code, against Rosita C. Pada, Teresita B. 
Rodriquez, Rachel V. Torres, Lourdes A. Enriquez and Salvador C. Sebastian. It 
reads: 




That on or about the period comprised between January 1989 and June 21, 1990, 
in the City of Zamboanga, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, all public officers, ROSITA C. PADA, 
being then the Regional Postage Stamps Custodian, and as such is accountable for 
the custody of the postage stamps received and issued by her by reason of the 
duties of her office, TERESITA B. RODRIGUEZ, being then the Senior Clerk in the 
Postage Stamps Section, RACHEL V. TORRES, being then a Utility Man in the 
Postage Stamps Section, LOURDES A. ENRIQUEZ, being then a Senior Clerk in the 
Mail Delivery Section and SALVADOR C. SEBASTIAN, being then a Letter Carrier, 
all of the Postal Services Office, Region IX, Zamboanga City, while in the 
performance of their official functions, taking advantage of their position, 
committing the offense in relation to their office, and conspiring and 
confederating with one another, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, 
feloniously and with grave abuse of confidence, misappropriate, misapply, and 
embezzle and convert to their personal use and benefit the amount of SIX HUNDRED 
FORTY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY and 05/100 PESOS (P649,290.05), 
Philippine Currency, out of the postage stamps in the custody of accused Rosita 
C. Pada, to the damage and prejudice of the Government in the aforesaid sum.


Contrary to law.


Rosita C. Pada, Rachel V. Torres, and Salvador C. Sebastian entered separate 
pleas of "Not Guilty" on October 13, 1992.
[4]
 


On April 22, 1993, the marking of the documents to be testified on by the 
lone prosecution witness, Auditor Lilibeth Rugayan of the Commission on Audit, 
who conducted the audit examination, took place before the Deputy Clerk of Court 
of the First Division of the Sandiganbayan. The marking of the exhibits was with 
the conformity of all of the accused and their respective counsel. 


Upon the completion of the testimony of Auditor Rugayan, the prosecution 
rested its case
[5]
and formally offered 
its evidence on July 6, 1993.
[6]
 Among 
those offered as evidence were the sworn statements made by all the accused, 
including that of petitioner, and previously marked as exhibits "Q", "R", "S", 
"T", "U", and "U-1" for the prosecution. Said exhibits were offered as part of 
the testimony of Auditor Rugayan.


On August 19, 1993, all the accused (including petitioner) filed their "Joint 
Objections to Formal Offer of Evidence" on the principal ground that the sworn 
statements were "hearsay" evidence.
[7]




The Sandiganbayan in its Minute Resolution
[8]
 dated August 24, 1993, admitted said 
evidence, thus:




Acting upon the "FORMAL OFFER OF EVIDENCE" dated July 5, 1993, of the 
Prosecution and considering the "JOINT OBJECTIONS TO FORMAL OFFER OF EVIDENCE" 
dated August 19, 1993, of accused, the Court RESOLVES the same as follows: 


Exhibits A, B, and C are admitted, they being certified true copies of 
official documents; Exhibits D up to U and U-1 inclusive of submarkings are 
admitted as part of the testimony of Lilibeth Rugayan as examining auditor under 
the State Auditing Code (P.D. No. 1445). 


Dissatisfied, the three accused, on September 13, 1993, jointly filed a 
Motion for Reconsideration, but the same was denied by the respondent court in 
its Resolution
[9]
 dated September 27, 
1993. It ruled that:




Considering that under the Order of this Court dated April 22, 1993 (p. 85) 
the exhibits "off-court" was admitted by the accused through counsel, among 
which were exhibits "A", "B" and "C", the Motion for Reconsideration filed by 
the accused Pada, Torres and Sebastian with regard to the admission of said 
exhibits dated September 10, 1993 is denied. 


Hence, this petition. 


The only issue to be resolved in the present petition is whether or not the 
sworn statements of petitioner and his co-accused are admissible in evidence "as 
part of the testimony of the prosecution witness". 


Petitioner argues that the said issue should be resolved in the negative on 
the ground that the subject sworn statements are hearsay evidence. Petitioner 
contends that he and his co-accused were never presented as witnesses, thus, 
they were not given the opportunity to identify and authenticate their 
respective sworn statements and that Auditor Rugayan had no personal knowledge 
of the contents thereof. 


We disagree. 


As a general rule, hearsay evidence is inadmissible. Thus, the rule 
explicitly provides that a witness can testify only on those facts which he 
knows of his personal knowledge, that is, which are derived from his own 
perceptions.
[10]
 However, while the 
testimony of a witness regarding a statement made by another person, if intended 
to establish the truth of the fact asserted in the statement, is clearly hearsay 
evidence, it is otherwise if the purpose of placing the statement in the record 
is merely to establish the fact that the statement was made or the tenor of such 
statement.
[11]
 


In the present case, the sworn statements executed by the petitioner and 
co-accused were offered not to prove the truth or falsity of the facts stated 
therein but only to prove that such written statements were actually made and 
executed. As stated in the Resolution dated August 24, 1993 of the respondent 
court, Exhibits "D" up to "U" and "U-1" were admitted only as part of the 
testimony of Lilibeth Rugayan as Examining Auditor. Title II, Chapter I, Section 
55 of P.D. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code provides that 
"the auditor shall obtain through inspections, observation, inquiries, 
confirmation and other techniques, sufficient competent evidential matter to 
afford himself a reasonable basis for his opinions, judgments, conclusions and 
recommendations".


It is also the contention of petitioner that he never admitted the said sworn 
statements during the pre-trial conference; that he agreed merely to the 
"marking" of the said sworn statements as exhibits of the prosecution; and that 
"marking" is different from "admission". 


The main purpose of a pre-trial is to expedite the trial. Thus, the 
respondent court in its Order dated April 22, 1993 ruled that: 




By agreement of the parties, the sub-marking of the documents to be testified 
to by Auditor Lilibeth Rugayan has been completed and only the other 
sub-markings will take place during the proceedings. Additionally, the parties 
have informally agreed that all the documents marked today are deemed 
authenticated except for the alleged responses of the various postmasters as to 
the request for confirmation which the accused dispute both as to their 
authenticity as well as to their accuracy assuming that they are authentic. In 
view of this, subject to confirmation this afternoon, the direct examination 
will be waived and the cross-examination by the accused will take place 
primarily to dispute the statement above-mentioned. 


This Order of the Sandiganbayan reciting the actions taken, the facts 
stipulated, and evidence marked, binds the parties and limits the trial to 
matters not disposed of and shall control the course of the action during the 
trial, unless modified by the court to prevent manifest injustice.
[12]
 The record does not show that petitioner 
and his co-accused objected to the above-mentioned Order. In any event, any 
evidence presented during the pre-trial conference cannot be considered by the 
court if not formally offered. It has been held that any evidence which a party 
desiring to submit for the consideration of the court must be formally offered 
by him.
[13]
 Such a formal offer is 
necessary because it is the duty of the judge to rest his findings of facts and 
his judgment only upon the evidence offered by the parties at the trial. 


Petitioner in his supplemental pleading claims to have been deprived of his 
constitutional rights under Sections 12 and 17, Article III of the 1987 
Constitution. Petitioner alleges that nothing in his sworn statement shows 
compliance with the constitutional provisions on the right to counsel, the right 
to remain silent and the right to waive these rights in the presence of counsel. 



Entrenched is the rule that the rights provided in Section 12, Article III of 
the Constitution may be invoked only when a person is under "custodial 
investigation" or is "in custody investigation." Custodial investigation has 
been defined as any questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a 
person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of 
action in any significant way.
[14]
 The 
fact-finding investigation relative to the missing postage stamps at the Postage 
Stock Section of Zamboanga City conducted by a Enrique G. Saavedra, Chief Postal 
Service Officer, is not a custodial investigation. It is merely an 
administrative investigation. 


While an investigation conducted by an administrative body may at times be 
akin to a criminal proceeding, the fact remains that under existing laws, a 
party in an administrative inquiry 
may or may not be assisted by counsel
, 
irrespective of the nature of the charges and of the respondent's capacity to 
represent himself, and no duty rests on such a body to furnish the person being 
investigated with counsel.
[15]
 It has 
been held in the case of Lumiqued v. Exevea
[16]
 that the right to counsel is not 
imperative in administrative investigations because such inquiries are conducted 
merely to determine whether there are facts that merit disciplinary measures 
against erring public officers and employees, with the purpose of maintaining 
the dignity of government service. 


Petitioner, likewise contends that the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of 
discretion in filing the Information for malversation against him. He argues 
that in its first Resolution dated March 18, 1992 of the Office of the 
Ombudsman, Graft Investigation Officer Rodolfo Rojas, Jr. recommended the filing 
of an Information for Malversation of Public Funds against Rosita C. Pada only. 
However, in its subsequent resolution dated July 28, 1992, Special Prosecution 
Officer Teresita Daiz-Baldos recommended the prosecution of the four other 
accused, including petitioner, stating that:




Thus, for purposes of prosecution, it would be more expedient to indict all 
the respondents for Malversation and let them explain in court the actual extent 
of their individual accountability. x x x x x x


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the undersigned respectfully recommends the 
prosecution of Rosita Pada, Teresita Rodriguez, Rachel Torres, Lourdes Enriquez 
and Salvador Sebastian, for Malversation of Public Funds, and the exclusion for 
liability of Florecita Doromal."


Hence, petitioner now questions the disposition of the Ombudsman as merely 
engaging in a fishing expedition in this case. 


This Court has consistently refrained from interfering with the exercise by 
the Ombudsman of his constitutionally mandated investigatory and prosecutory 
power. Otherwise stated, it is not for this Court to review the exercise of 
discretion of the Ombudsman in prosecuting or dismissing a complaint filed 
before his Office. Such initiative and independence are inherent in the 
Ombudsman who, beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and 
preserver of the integrity of the public service.
[17]
 


Lastly, the Court noted that the petition, as described therein, is one filed 
under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. However, under Rule 45, a petition for 
review on certiorari is a mode of appeal from judgments or final orders or 
resolutions and limited to questions of law. Petitioner's choice of remedy 
therefore is clearly an error. The resolutions of the Sandiganbayan herein 
sought to be reviewed or set aside are not in any sense judgments or final 
orders or resolutions; they are interlocutory in nature and from which no appeal 
lies. 


WHEREFORE
, the petition is hereby 
DISMISSED
 for lack 
of merit. 


SO ORDERED.
