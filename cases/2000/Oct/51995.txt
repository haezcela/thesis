GONZAGA-REYES, J.:


Petitioners seek the reversal of the decision of the First Division of the 
Court of Appeals dated November 14, 1997 in CA-G.R. CV No. 27220, entitled 
"Heirs of Ramon Durano, Sr., et. al. versus Spouses Angeles Supelveda Uy, et. 
al.", and the resolution of the Court of Appeals dated October 29, 1998 which 
denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.


The antecedents of this case may be traced as far back as August 1970; it 
involves a 128-hectare parcel of land located in the barrios of Dunga and 
Cahumayhumayan, Danao City. On December 27, 1973, the late Congressman Ramon 
Durano, Sr., together with his son Ramon Durano III, and the latter's wife, 
Elizabeth Hotchkiss Durano (petitioners in the herein case), instituted an 
action for damages against spouses Angeles Supelveda Uy and Emigdio Bing Sing 
Uy, spouses Faustino Alatan and Valeriana Garro, spouses Rufino Lavador and 
Aurelia Mata, Silvestre Ramos, Hermogenes Tito, Teotimo Gonzales, Primitiva 
Garro, Julian Garro, Ismael Garro, Bienvenido Castro, Glicerio Barriga, Beatriz 
Calzada, Andrea Mata de Batulan, Teofista Alcala, Filemon Lavador, Candelario 
Lumantao, Gavino Quimbo, Justino Tito, Marcelino Gonzales, Salvador Dayday, 
Venancia Repaso, Leodegario Gonzales, Jose de la Calzada, Restituta Gonzales, 
and Cosme Ramos (herein respondents
[1]
) 
before Branch XVII of the then Court of First Instance of Cebu, Danao City.


In that case, docketed as Civil Case No. DC-56, petitioners accused 
respondents of officiating a "hate campaign" against them by lodging complaints 
in the Police Department of Danao City in August 1970, over petitioners' 
so-called "invasion" of respondents' alleged properties in Cahumayhumayan, Danao 
City. This was followed by another complaint sent by respondents to the 
President of the Philippines in February 1971, which depicted petitioners as 
"oppressors", "landgrabbers" and "usurpers" of respondents' alleged rights. Upon 
the direction of the President, the Department of Justice through City Fiscal 
Jesus Navarro and the Philippine Constabulary of Cebu simultaneously conducted 
investigations on the matter. Respondents' complaints were dismissed as 
"baseless", and they appealed the same to the Secretary of Justice, who called 
for another investigation to be jointly conducted by the Special Prosecutor and 
the Office of the City Fiscal of Danao City. During the course of said joint 
investigation, respondents Hermogenes Tito and Salvador Dayday again lodged a 
complaint with the Office of the President, airing the same charges of 
"landgrabbing". The investigations on this new complaint, jointly conducted by 
the 3
rd
 Philippine Constabulary Zone and the Citizens Legal 
Assistance Office resulted in the finding that "(petitioners) should not be held 
answerable therefor."
[2]
 


Petitioners further alleged in their complaint before the CFI that during the 
course of the above investigations, respondents kept spreading false rumors and 
damaging tales which put petitioners into public contempt and ridicule.
[3]
 


In their Answer, respondents lodged their affirmative defenses, demanded the 
return of their respective properties, and made counterclaims for actual, moral 
and exemplary damages. Respondents stated that sometime in the early part of 
August 1970 and months thereafter they received mimeographed notices dated 
August 2, 1970 and signed by the late Ramon Durano, Sr., informing them that the 
lands which they are tilling and residing in, formerly owned by the Cebu 
Portland Cement Company (hereafter, "Cepoc"), had been purchased by Durano & 
Co., Inc. The notices also declared that the lands were needed by Durano & 
Co. for planting to sugar and for roads or residences, and directed respondents 
to immediately turn over the said lands to the representatives of the company. 
Simultaneously, tall bamboo poles with pennants at the tops thereof were planted 
in some areas of the lands and metal sheets bearing the initials "RMD" were 
nailed to posts.


As early as the first week of August 1970, and even before many of the 
respondents received notices to vacate, men who identified themselves as 
employees of Durano & Co. proceeded to bulldoze the lands occupied by 
various respondents, destroying in their wake the plantings and improvements 
made by the respondents therein. On some occasions, respondents alleged, these 
men fired shots in the air, purportedly acting upon the instructions of 
petitioner Ramon Durano III and/or Ramon Durano, Jr. On at least one instance, 
petitioners Ramon Durano III and Elizabeth Hotchkiss Durano were seen on the 
site of the bulldozing operations.


On September 15, 1970, Durano & Co. sold the disputed property to 
petitioner Ramon Durano III, who procured the registration of these lands in his 
name under TCT No. T-103 and TCT No. T-104.


Respondents contended that the display of force and the known power and 
prestige of petitioners and their family restrained them from directly resisting 
this wanton depredation upon their property. During that time, the mayor of 
Danao City was Mrs. Beatriz Durano, wife of Ramon Durano, Sr. and mother of 
petitioner Ramon Durano III. Finding no relief from the local police, who 
respondents said merely laughed at them for daring to complain against the 
Duranos, they organized themselves and sent a letter to then President Ferdinand 
Marcos reporting dispossession of their properties and seeking a determination 
of the ownership of the land. This notwithstanding, the bulldozing operations 
continued until the City Fiscal was requested by the Department of Justice to 
conduct an investigation on the matter. When, on July 27, 1971, the City Fiscal 
announced that he would be unable to conduct a preliminary investigation, 
respondents urged the Department of Justice to conduct the preliminary 
investigation. This was granted, and the investigations which spanned the period 
March 1972 to April 1973 led to the conclusion that respondents' complaint was 
untenable.
[4]
 


In their counterclaim, respondents alleged that petitioners' acts deprived 
most of them of their independent source of income and have made destitutes of 
some of them. Also, petitioners have done serious violence to respondents' 
spirit, as citizens and human beings, to the extent that one of them had been 
widowed by the emotional shock that the damage and dispossession has caused.
[5]
 Thus, in addition to the dismissal of the 
complaint, respondents demanded actual damages for the cost of the improvements 
they made on the land, together with the damage arising from the dispossession 
itself; moral damages for the anguish they underwent as a result of the 
high-handed display of power by petitioners in depriving them of their 
possession and property; as well as exemplary damages, attorney's fees and 
expenses of litigation.

[6]
 


On April 22, 1975, petitioners moved to dismiss their complaint with the 
trial court. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, without prejudice to 
respondents' right to proceed with their counterclaim. Hence, the trial 
proceeded only on the counterclaim.


On September 23, 1980, this Court issued a resolution in Administrative 
Matter No. 6290 changing the venue of trial in Civil Case No. DC-56 to the 
Regional Trial Court of Cebu City. 


The change was mainly in line with the transfer of Judge Bernardo Ll. Salas, 
who presided over the case in Danao City, to Cebu City. The parties agreed to 
dispense with pre-trial, and for the evidence-in-chief to be submitted by way of 
affidavits together with a schedule of documentary exhibits, subject to 
additional direct examination, cross examination and presentation of rebuttal 
evidence by the parties.


The trial court and later, the Court of Appeals, took note of the following 
portions of affidavits submitted by petitioners:




xxx City Fiscal Jesus Navarro said that in August, 1967, he issued subpoenas 
to several tenants in Cahumayhumayan upon representation by Cepoc, the latter 
protesting failure by the tenants to continue giving Cepoc its share of the corn 
produce. He learned from the tenants that the reason why they were reluctant and 
as a matter of fact some defaulted in giving Cepoc its share, was that Uy Bing 
Sepulveda made similar demands to them for his share in the produce, and that 
they did not know to whom the shares should be given.










xxx




xxx




xxx




Jesus Capitan said that he is familiar with the place Cahumayhumayan and that 
the properties in said locality were acquired by Durano and Company and Ramon 
Durano III, but formerly owned by Cepoc.


When the properties of Ramonito Durano were cultivated, the owners of the 
plants requested him that they be given something for their effort even if the 
properties do not belong to them but to Cepoc, and that he was directed by 
Ramonito Durano to do a listing of the improvements as well as the owners. After 
he made a listing, this was given to Ramonito who directed Benedicto Ramos to do 
payment.


When he was preparing the list, they did not object to the removal of the 
plants because the counterclaimants understood that the lands did not belong to 
them, but later and because of politics a complaint was filed, and finally that 
when he was doing the listing, the improvements were even pointed to him by the 
counterclaimants themselves. (Exh. 48, Records, p. 385-386).










xxx




xxx




xxx




Ruperto Rom said that he had an occasion to work at Cepoc from 1947 to 1950 
together with Benedicto and Tomas Ramos, the latter a 
capataz
 of the 
Durano Sugar Mills. Owner of the properties, subject of the complaint, was 
Cepoc.


The persons who eventually tilled the Cepoc properties were merely allowed to 
do cultivation if planted to corn, and for Cepoc to be given a share, which 
condition was complied with by all including the counterclaimants. He even 
possessed one parcel which he planted to coconuts, jackfruit trees and other 
plants. (Exh. 51, Records, pp. 383-384)










xxx




xxx




xxx




Co-defendant Ramon Durano III said that he agreed with the dismissal of the 
complaint because his father's wish was reconciliation with the defendants 
following the death of Pedro Sepulveda, father of Angeles Sepulveda Uy, but 
inspite of the dismissal of the complaint, the defendants still prosecuted their 
counterclaim.


The disputed properties were owned formerly by Cepoc, and then of the latter 
selling the properties to Durano and Company and then by the latter to him as of 
September 15, 1970. As a matter of fact, TCT T-103 and T-104 were issued to him 
and that from that time on, he paid the taxes.


At the time he purchased the properties, they were not occupied by the 
defendants. The first time he learned about the alleged bulldozing of the 
improvements was when the defendants filed the complaint of land grabbing 
against their family with the Office of the President and the attendant 
publicity. Precisely his family filed the complaint against them. (Exh. 57, 
Records, pp. 723-730)

Congressman Ramon Durano said he is familiar with the properties, being owned 
originally by Cepoc. Thereafter they were purchased by Durano and Company and 
then sold to Ramon Durano III, the latter now the owner. He filed a motion to 
dismiss the case against Angeles Sepulveda et al. as a gesture of respect to the 
deceased Pedro Sepulveda, father of Angeles Sepulveda, and as a Christian, said 
Pedro Sepulveda being the former Mayor of Danao, if only to stop all 
misunderstanding between their families.

He was the one who did the discovery of the properties that belonged to 
Cepoc, which happened when he was doing mining work near Cahumayhumayan and 
without his knowledge extended his operation within the area belonging to Cepoc. 
After Cepoc learned of the substantial coal deposits, the property was claimed 
by Cepoc and then a survey was made to relocate the muniments. Eventually he 
desisted doing mining work and limited himself within the confines of his 
property that was adjacent to Cepoc's property. All the claimants except 
Sepulveda Uy were occupants of the Cepoc properties. Durano and Company 
purchased the property adjacent to Cepoc, developed the area, mined the coal and 
had the surveyed area planted with sugar cane, and finally the notices to the 
occupants because of their intention to plant sugar cane and other crops (T.S. 
N. December 4, 1985, pp. 31-32, 44-54, RTC Decision, pp. 16-19, Records, pp. 
842-845).
[7]
 


Petitioners also presented Court Commissioner, Engineer Leonidas Gicain, who 
was directed by the trial court to conduct a field survey of the disputed 
property. Gicain conducted surveys on the areas subjected to bulldozing, 
including those outside the Cepoc properties. The survey --- which was based on 
TCT No. T-103 and TCT No. T-104, titled in the name of Ramon Durano III, and TCT 
No. 35, in the name of respondent Emigdio Bing Sing Uy --- was paid for by 
petitioners.
[8]
 


Respondents, for their part, also presented their affidavits and supporting 
documentary evidence, including tax declarations covering such portions of the 
property as they formerly inhabited and cultivated.


On March 8, 1990, the RTC issued a decision upholding respondents' 
counterclaim. The dispositive portion of said decision reads: 




"THE FOREGOING CONSIDERED, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the 
counter claimants and against the plaintiffs directing the latter to pay the

SO ORDERED. 
[9]


The RTC found that the case preponderated in favor of respondents, who all 
possessed their respective portions of the property covered by TCT Nos. T-103 
and T-104 thinking that they were the absolute owners thereof. A number of these 
respondents alleged that they inherited these properties from their parents, who 
in turn inherited them from their own parents. Some others came into the 
properties by purchase from the former occupants thereof. They and their 
predecessors were responsible for the plantings and improvements on the 
property. They were the ones who sought for the properties to be tax-declared in 
their respective names, and they continually paid the taxes thereto. Respondents 
maintained that they were unaware of anyone claiming adverse possession or 
ownership of these lands until the bulldozing operations in 1970.


As for Venancia Repaso, Hermogenes Tito and Marcelino Gonzales, the Court 
found that the properties they laid claim to were not part of the land that was 
purchased by Durano & Co. from Cepoc. Thus, it found the bulldozing of these 
lands by petitioners totally unjustified and ordered not only the total 
reimbursement of useful and necessary expenses on the properties but also the 
return of these properties to Repaso, Tito and Gonzales, respectively. As for 
all the other respondents, the RTC found their possession of the properties to 
be in the concept of owner and adjudged them to be builders in good faith. 
Considering that petitioners in the instant case appropriated the improvements 
on the areas overran by the bulldozers, the RTC ruled that "(t)he right of 
retention to the improvements necessarily should be secured (in favor of 
respondents) until reimbursed not only of the necessary but also useful 
expenses."
[10]


On the matter of litigation expenses and attorney's fees, the RTC observed 
that the trial period alone consisted of forty (40) trial dates spread over a 
period of sixteen (16) years. At the time, respondents were represented by 
counsel based in Manila, and the trial court took into consideration the travel, 
accommodation and miscellaneous expenses of their lawyer that respondents must 
have shouldered during the trial of the case.


Dissatisfied, petitioners appealed the RTC decision to the Court of Appeals, 
which, in turn, affirmed the said decision and ordered the return of the 
property to 
all
 the respondents-claimants, in effect modifying the RTC 
decision which allowed return only in favor of respondents Repaso, Tito and 
Gonzales.


In its decision, the Court of Appeals upheld the factual findings and 
conclusions of the RTC, including the awards for actual damages, attorney's fees 
and litigation expenses, and found additionally that the issuance of TCT Nos. 
T-103 and T-104 in the name of Ramon Durano III was attended by fraud. 
Evaluating the evidence before it, the Court of Appeals observed that the 
alleged reconstituted titles of Cepoc over the property, namely, TCT No. (RT-38) 
(T-14457) -4 and TCT No. (RT-39) (T-14456) -3 (Exhibits "19" and "20" of this 
case), which were claimed to be the derivative titles of TCT Nos. T-103 and 
T-104, were not submitted in evidence before the RTC. Thus, in an Order dated 
June 15, 1988, the RTC ordered Exhibits "19" and "20" deleted from petitioners' 
Offer of Exhibits. The Court of Appeals further noted that even among the 
exhibits subsequently produced by petitioners before the RTC, said Exhibits "19" 
and "20" were still not submitted.
[11]
 
Moreover, Cepoc had no registered title over the disputed property as indicated 
in TCT Nos. T-103 and T-104. Thus:

From the foregoing, the Court of Appeals concluded that the issuance of the 
TCT Nos. T-103 and T-104 in favor of petitioner Ramon Durano III was attended by 
fraud; hence, petitioners could not invoke the principle of indefeasibility of 
title. Additionally, the Court of Appeals found that the alleged Deed of 
Absolute Sale, undated, between Cepoc Industries, Inc. and Durano & Co. was 
not notarized and thus, unregistrable.


The Court of Appeals went on to state that while, on the one hand, no valid 
issuance of title may be imputed in favor of petitioners from the private Deed 
of Sale and the alleged reconstituted titles of Cepoc that were not presented in 
evidence, respondents, in contrast --- who although admittedly had no registered 
titles in their names --- were able to demonstrate possession that was public, 
continuous and adverse --- or possession in the concept of owner, and which was 
much prior (one or two generations back for many of respondents) to the claim of 
ownership of petitioners.


Thus, the Court of Appeals ordered the return of the properties covered by 
TCT Nos. T-103 and T-104 to all respondents who made respective claims thereto. 
Corollarily, it declared that petitioners were possessors in bad faith, and were 
not entitled to reimbursement for useful expenses incurred in the conversion of 
the property into sugarcane lands. It also gave no merit to petitioners' 
allegation that the actual damages awarded by the trial court were excessive, or 
to petitioners' argument that they should not have been held personally liable 
for any damages imputable to Durano & Co.


Following is the dispositive portion of the decision of the Court of 
Appeals:




WHEREFORE, the appealed decision of the lower court in Civil Case No. DC-56 
is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION ordering the return of the respective 
subject properties to all the defendants-appellees, without indemnity to the 
plaintiffs-appellants as regards whatever improvements made therein by the 
latter. In all other respects, said decision in affirmed.


Costs against plaintiffs-appellants.


SO ORDERED.
[13]
 


On October 29, 1998, the Court of Appeals denied petitioners' motion for 
reconsideration for lack of merit. Hence, this petition.


Petitioners assign the following errors from the CA decision:


The Court of Appeals erred in granting relief to the respondents who did not 
appeal the decision of the lower court.


The Court of Appeals erred in collaterally attacking the validity of the 
title of petitioner Ramon Durano III.


The respondents should not have been adjudged builders in good 
faith.


The petitioners should not be held personally liable for damages because of 
the doctrine of separate corporate personality.


It was an error to hold that the respondents had proved the existence of 
improvements on the land by preponderance of evidence, and in awarding excessive 
damages therefor.


It was error to direct the return of the properties to respondents Venancia 
Repaso, Hermogenes Tito and Marcelino Gonzales.


The award of litigation expenses and attorney's fees was erroneous.


The petitioners are not possessors in bad faith. 


On their first assignment of error, petitioners contend that before the Court 
of Appeals, they only questioned that portion of the RTC decision which directed 
the return of the properties to respondents Repaso, Tito and Gonzales. They 
argued that the return of the properties to all the other respondents by the 
Court of Appeals was erroneous because it was not among the errors assigned or 
argued by petitioners on appeal. Besides, since respondents themselves did not 
appeal from the RTC decision on the issue of return of the physical possession 
of the property, it is understood that judgment as to them has already become 
final by operation of law. To support its argument, petitioners cited the cases 
of 
Madrideo vs. Court of Appeals
[14]
 and 
Medida vs. Court of 
Appeals
[15]
, which held that 
"whenever an appeal is taken in a civil case an appellee who has not himself 
appealed cannot obtain from the appellate court any affirmative relief other 
than the ones granted in the decision of the court below." 


Rule 51 of the New Rules of Civil Procedure provides:




Sec. 8. 
Questions that may be decided.
 --- No error which does not 
affect the jurisdiction over the subject matter or the validity of the judgment 
appealed from or the proceedings therein will be considered unless stated in the 
assignment of errors, or closely related to or dependent on an assigned error 
and properly argued in the brief, save as the court may pass upon plain errors 
and clerical errors.


We find untenable petitioners' argument that since no party (whether 
petitioners or respondents) appealed for the return of the properties to 
respondents other than Repaso, Tito and Gonzales, that portion of the RTC 
decision that awards damages to such other respondents is final and may no 
longer be altered by the Court of Appeals. A reading of the provisions of 
Section 8, Rule 51, aforecited, indicates that the Court of Appeals is not 
limited to reviewing only those errors assigned by appellant, but also those 
that are closely related to or dependent on an assigned error.
[16]
 In other words, the Court of Appeals is 
imbued with sufficient discretion to review matters, not otherwise assigned as 
errors on appeal, if it finds that their consideration is necessary in arriving 
at a complete and just resolution of the case. In this case, the Court of 
Appeals ordered the return of the properties to respondents merely as a 
legal 
consequence
 of the finding that respondents had a better right of possession 
than petitioners over the disputed properties, the former being possessors in 
the concept of owner. Thus, it held ---




Plaintiffs-appellants have to return possession of the subject property, not 
only to defendants-appellees Venancia Repaso, Hermogenes Tito and Marcelino 
Gonzales but to all other defendants-appellees herein, by virtue of the latter's 
priority in time of declaring the corresponding portions of the subject 
properties in their name and/or their predecessors-in-interest coupled with 
actual possession of the same property through their predecessors-in-interest in 
the concept of an owner. Plaintiffs-appellants who had never produced in court a 
valid basis by which they are claiming possession or ownership over the said 
property cannot have a better right over the subject properties than 
defendants-appellees.
[17]




Moreover, petitioners' reliance on the 
Madrideo
 and 
Medida
 
cases is misplaced. In the 
Madrideo
 case, the predecessors-in-interest of 
the Llorente Group sold the disputed property to the Alcala Group, who in turn 
sold the same to the spouses Maturgo. The RTC adjudged the spouses Maturgo 
purchasers in good faith, such that they could retain their title to the 
property, but held that the Lllorente Group was unlawfully divested of its 
ownership of the property by the Alcala Group. The Alcala Group appealed this 
decision to the Court of Appeals, who denied the appeal and ordered the 
reinstatement in the records of the Registry of Deeds of the Original 
Certificates of Title of the predecessors-in-interest of the Llorente Group. In 
setting aside the decision of the Court of Appeals, this Court held that no 
relief may be afforded in favor of the Llorente Group to the prejudice of the 
spouses Maturgo, who --- the Court carefully emphasized --- were 
third 
parties to the appeal
, being neither appellants nor appellees before the 
Court of Appeals, and whose title to the disputed property was confirmed by the 
RTC. The application of the ruling in 
Madrideo
 to the instant case bears 
no justification because it is clear that petitioners, in appealing the RTC 
decision, impleaded all the herein respondents.


Meanwhile, in the 
Medida
 case, petitioners (who were the appellees 
before the Court of Appeals) sought the reversal of a finding of the RTC before 
the Supreme Court. The Court explained that since petitioners failed to appeal 
from the RTC decision, they --- as appellees before the Court of Appeals --- 
could only argue for the purpose of sustaining the judgment in their favor, and 
could not ask for any affirmative relief other than that granted by the court 
below. The factual milieu in 
Medida
 is different from that of the instant 
case, where the return of the properties to respondents was not an "affirmative 
relief" sought by respondents but an independent determination of the Court of 
Appeals proceeding from its findings that respondents were long-standing 
possessors in the concept of owner while petitioners were builders in bad faith. 
Certainly, under such circumstances, the Court of Appeals is not precluded from 
modifying the decision of the RTC in order to accord complete relief to 
respondents.


Moving now to the other errors assigned in the petition, the return of the 
properties to respondents Repaso, Tito and Gonzales was premised upon the 
factual finding that these lands were outside the properties claimed by 
petitioners under TCT Nos. T-103 and T-104. Such factual finding of the RTC, 
sustained by the Court of Appeals, is now final and binding upon this Court.


In respect of the properties supposedly covered by TCT Nos. T-103 and T-104, 
the Court of Appeals basically affirmed the findings of the RTC that respondents 
have shown prior and actual possession thereof in the concept of owner, whereas 
petitioners failed to substantiate a valid and legitimate acquisition of the 
property --- considering that the alleged titles of Cepoc from which TCT Nos. 
T-103 and T-104 were supposed to have derived title were not produced, and the 
deed of sale between Cepoc and Durano & Co. was unregistrable.


The records clearly bear out respondents' prior and actual possession; more 
exactly, the records indicate that respondents' possession has ripened into 
ownership by acquisitive prescription.


Ordinary acquisitive prescription, in the case of immovable property, 
requires possession of the thing 
in
 
good faith
 and with 
just 
title
,
[18]
 for a period of ten 
years.
[19]
 A possessor is deemed to be 
"in good faith" when he is not aware of any flaw in his title or mode of 
acquisition of the property.
[20]
 On the 
other hand, there is "just title" when the adverse claimant came into possession 
of the property through one of the modes for acquiring ownership recognized by 
law, but the grantor was not the owner or could not transmit any right.
[21]
 The claimant by prescription may compute 
the ten-year period by tacking his possession to that of his grantor or 
predecessor-in-interest.
[22]
 


The evidence shows that respondents successfully complied with all the 
requirements for acquisitive prescription to set in. The properties were 
conveyed to respondents by purchase or inheritance, and in each case the 
respondents were in actual, continuous, open and adverse possession of the 
properties. They exercised rights of ownership over the lands, including the 
regular payment of taxes and introduction of plantings and improvements. They 
were unaware of anyone claiming to be the owner of these lands other than 
themselves until the notices of demolition in 1970 --- and at the time each of 
them had already completed the ten-year prescriptive period either by their own 
possession or by obtaining from the possession of their 
predecessors-in-interest. Contrary to the allegation of petitioners that the 
claims of all twenty-two (22) respondents were lumped together and 
indiscriminately sustained, the lower courts (especially the RTC) took careful 
consideration of the claims individually, taking note of the respective modes 
and dates of acquisition. Whether respondents' predecessors-in-interest in fact 
had title to convey is irrelevant under the concept of just title and for 
purposes of prescription.


Thus, respondents' counterclaim for reconveyance and damages before the RTC 
was premised upon a claim of ownership as indicated by the following 
allegations:




(Y)our defendants are owners and occupants of different parcels of land 
located in Barrio Cahumayhumayan, your defendants having occupied these parcels 
of land for various periods by themselves or through their 
predecessors-in-interest, some for over fifty years, and some with titles issued 
under the Land Registration Act; xxxxx 
[23]
 


Respondents' claim of ownership by acquisitive prescription (in respect of 
the properties covered by TCT Nos. T-103 and T-104) having been duly alleged and 
proven, the Court deems it only proper that such claim be categorically upheld. 
Thus, the decision of the Court of Appeals insofar as it merely declares those 
respondents possessors in the concept of owner is modified to reflect the 
evidence on record which indicates that such possession had been converted to 
ownership by ordinary prescription.


Turning now to petitioners' claim to ownership and title, it is uncontested 
that their claim hinges largely on TCT Nos. T-103 and T-104, issued in the name 
of petitioner Ramon Durano III. However, the validity of these certificates of 
title was put to serious doubt by the following: (1) the certificates reveal the 
lack of registered title of Cepoc to the properties;
[24]
 (2) the alleged reconstituted titles of 
Cepoc were not produced in evidence; and (3) the deed of sale between Cepoc and 
Durano & Co. was unnotarized and thus, unregistrable.


It is true that fraud in the issuance of a certificate of title may be raised 
only in an action expressly instituted for that purpose,
[25]
 and not collaterally as in the instant 
case which is an action for reconveyance and damages. While we cannot sustain 
the Court of Appeals' finding of fraud because of this jurisdictional 
impediment, we observe that the above-enumerated circumstances indicate none too 
clearly the weakness of petitioners' evidence on their claim of ownership. For 
instance, the non-production of the alleged reconstituted titles of Cepoc 
despite demand therefor gives rise to a presumption (unrebutted by petitioners) 
that such evidence, if produced, would be adverse to petitioners.
[26]
 Also, the unregistrability of the deed of 
sale is a serious defect that should affect the validity of the certificates of 
title. Notarization of the deed of sale is essential to its registrability,
[27]
 and the action of the Register of Deeds 
in allowing the registration of the unacknowledged deed of sale was unauthorized 
and did not render validity to the registration of the document.
[28]


Furthermore, a purchaser of a parcel of land cannot close his eyes to facts 
which should put a reasonable man upon his guard, such as when the property 
subject of the purchase is in the possession of persons other than the 
seller.
[29]
 A buyer who could not have 
failed to know or discover that the land sold to him was in the adverse 
possession of another is a buyer in bad faith.
[30]
 In the herein case, respondents were in 
open possession and occupancy of the properties when Durano & Co. supposedly 
purchased the same from Cepoc. Petitioners made no attempt to investigate the 
nature of respondents' possession before they ordered demolition in August 
1970.


In the same manner, the purchase of the property by petitioner Ramon Durano 
III from Durano & Co. could not be said to have been in good faith. It is 
not disputed that Durano III acquired the property with full knowledge of 
respondents' occupancy thereon. There even appears to be undue haste in the 
conveyance of the property to Durano III, as the bulldozing operations by Durano 
& Co. were still underway when the deed of sale to Durano III was executed 
on September 15, 1970. There is not even an indication that Durano & Co. 
attempted to transfer registration of the property in its name before it 
conveyed the same to Durano III.


In the light of these circumstances, petitioners could not justifiably invoke 
the defense of indefeasibility of title to defeat respondents' claim of 
ownership by prescription. The rule on indefeasibility of title, 
i.e.
, 
that Torrens titles can be attacked for fraud only within one year from the date 
of issuance of the decree of registration, does not altogether deprive an 
aggrieved party of a remedy at law. As clarified by the Court in 
Javier vs. 
Court of Appeals
[31]
 ---




The decree (of registration) becomes incontrovertible and can no longer be 
reviewed after one (1) year from the date of the decree so that the only remedy 
of the landowner whose property has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in 
another's name is to bring an ordinary action in court for reconveyance, which 
is an action 
in personam
 and is always available as long as the property 
has not passed to an innocent third party for value. If the property has passed 
into the hands of an innocent purchaser for value, the remedy is an action for 
damages.


In the instant case, respondents' action for reconveyance will prosper, it 
being clear that the property, wrongfully registered in the name of petitioner 
Durano III, has not passed to an innocent purchaser for value.


Since petitioners knew fully well the defect in their titles, they were 
correctly held by the Court of Appeals to be builders in bad faith.


The Civil Code provides:




Art. 449. He who builds, plants or sows in bad faith on the land of another, 
loses what is built, planted or sown without right of indemnity.


Art. 450. The owner of the land on which anything has been built, planted or 
sown in bad faith may demand the demolition of the work, or that the planting or 
sowing be removed, in order to replace things in their former condition at the 
expense of the person who built, planted or sowed; or he may compel the builder 
or planter to pay the price of the land, and the sower the proper rent.


Art. 451. In the cases of the two preceding articles, the landowner is 
entitled to damages from the builder, planter or sower.


Based on these provisions, the owner of the land has three alternative 
rights: (1) to appropriate what has been built without any obligation to pay 
indemnity therefor, or (2) to demand that the builder remove what he had built, 
or (3) to compel the builder to pay the value of the land.
[32]
 In any case, the landowner is entitled to 
damages under Article 451, abovecited.


We sustain the return of the properties to respondents and the payment of 
indemnity as being in accord with the reliefs under the Civil Code.


On petitioners' fifth assignment of error that respondents had not proved the 
existence of improvements on the property by preponderance of evidence, and that 
the damages awarded by the lower courts were excessive and not actually proved, 
the Court notes that the issue is essentially factual. Petitioners, however, 
invoke Article 2199 of the Civil Code which requires actual damages to be duly 
proved. Passing upon this matter, the Court of Appeals cited with approval the 
decision of the RTC which stated:




The counter claimants made a detail of the improvements that were damaged. 
Then the query, how accurate were the listings, supposedly representing damaged 
improvements. The Court notes, some of the counter claimants' improvements in 
the tax declarations did not tally with the listings as mentioned in their 
individual affidavits. Also, others did not submit tax declarations supporting 
identity of the properties they possessed. The disparity with respect to the 
former and absence of tax declarations with respect to the latter, should not be 
a justification for defeating right of reimbursement. As a matter of fact, no 
controverting evidence was presented by the plaintiffs that the improvements 
being mentioned individually in the affidavits did not reflect the actual 
improvements that were overran by the bulldozing operation. Aside from that, the 
City Assessor, or any member of his staff, were not presented as witnesses. Had 
they been presented by the plaintiffs, the least that can be expected is that 
they would have enlightened the Court the extent of their individual holdings 
being developed in terms of existing improvements. This, the plaintiffs 
defaulted. It might be true that there were tax declarations, then presented as 
supporting documents by the counter claimants, but then mentioning improvements 
but in variance with the listings in the individual affidavits. This disparity 
similarly cannot be accepted as a basis for the setting aside of the listing of 
improvements being adverted to by the counter claimants in their affidavits. 
This Court is not foreclosing the possibility that the tax declarations on 
record were either table computations by the Assessor or his deputy, or tax 
declarations whose entries were merely copied from the old tax declarations 
during the period of revision. (RTC Decision, p. 36, Records, p. 862)
[33]


The right of the owner of the land to recover damages from a builder in bad 
faith is clearly provided for in Article 451 of the Civil Code. Although said 
Article 451 does not elaborate on the basis for damages, the Court perceives 
that it should reasonably correspond with the value of the properties lost or 
destroyed as a result of the occupation in bad faith, as well as the fruits 
(natural, industrial or civil) from those properties that the owner of the land 
reasonably expected to obtain. We sustain the view of the lower courts that the 
disparity between respondents' affidavits and their tax declarations on the 
amount of damages claimed should not preclude or defeat respondents' right to 
damages, which is guaranteed by Article 451. Moreover, under Article 2224 of the 
Civil Code:




Temperate or moderate damages, which are more than nominal but less than 
compensatory damages, may be recovered when the court finds that some pecuniary 
loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature of the case, be 
proved with certainty. We also uphold the award of litigation expenses and 
attorney's fees, it being clear that petitioners' acts compelled respondents to 
litigate and incur expenses to regain rightful possession and ownership over the 
disputed property.
[34]
 


The last issue presented for our resolution is whether petitioners could 
justifiably invoke the doctrine of separate corporate personality to evade 
liability for damages. The Court of Appeals applied the well-recognized 
principle of "piercing the corporate veil", 
i.e.
, the law will regard the 
act of the corporation as the act of its individual stockholders when it is 
shown that the corporation was used merely as an alter ego by those persons in 
the commission of fraud or other illegal acts. The test in determining the 
applicability of the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction is as 
follows:


Control, not mere majority or complete stock control, but complete 
domination, not only of finances but of policy and business practice in respect 
to the transaction attacked so that the corporate entity as to this transaction 
had at the time no separate mind, will or existence of its own;


Such control must have been used by the defendant to commit fraud or wrong, 
to perpetuate the violation of a statutory or other positive legal duty, or 
dishonest and unjust acts in contravention of plaintiff's legal rights; 
and


The aforesaid control and breach of duty must proximately cause the injury 
or unjust loss complained of. The absence of any one of these elements prevents 
"piercing the corporate veil". In applying the "instrumentality" or "alter ego" 
doctrine, the courts are concerned with reality and not form, with how the 
corporation operated and the individual defendant's relationship to that 
operation.
[35]
 


The question of whether a corporation is a mere alter ego is purely one of 
fact.
[36]
 The Court sees no reason to 
reverse the finding of the Court of Appeals. The facts show that shortly after 
the purported sale by Cepco to Durano & Co., the latter sold the property to 
petitioner Ramon Durano III, who immediately procured the registration of the 
property in his name. Obviously, Durano & Co. was used by petitioners merely 
as an instrumentality to appropriate the disputed property for themselves.


WHEREFORE
, the instant petition is 
DENIED
. The 
decision of the Court of Appeals is 
MODIFIED
 to declare 
respondents with claims to the properties covered by Transfer Certificate of 
Title Nos. T-103 and T-104 owners by acquisitive prescription to the extent of 
their respective claims. In all other respects, the decision of the Court of 
Appeals is 
AFFIRMED
. Costs against petitioners.
