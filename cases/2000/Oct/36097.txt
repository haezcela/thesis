PARDO, J.:


The case is a petition for certiorari
[1]
 to set aside (1) the resolution of the 
National Labor Relations Commission, Regional Arbitration Branch No. VII, Cebu 
City,
[2]
 the dispositive portion of which 
reads as follows: 




"WHEREFORE, premises considered, we hereby resolve that respondents herein 
jointly severally grant each of the 21 petitioners the sum of TWENTY SEVEN 
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED (P27,300.00) Pesos or the total sum of FIVE HUNDRED 
SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED (P573,300.00) Pesos in concept of 
separation pay of TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY (P2,730.00) Pesos each per 
year of service from February 1983 to June, 1993.


SO ORDERED." 


(2) the resolution
[3]
 disposing as 
follows: 




"WHEREFORE, respondents are hereby ordered to pay, jointly and severally, to 
each of the twenty-one (21) complainants a reinstatement salary and separation 
pay, computed as heretofore indicated: 










"I. Salary (April 16, -May 4, 1993) P90.73 x 19 days 
-----------------




P1,723.87 




"II. Separation Pay P90.73 x 26 days X 10 yr. ---------------------




23,589.80




 




25,313.67 




"Multiplied by no. of complainants 




_____x 21 




"TOTAL LIABILITY OF RESPONDENTS: 




P531,587.07








"SO ORDERED." 



and (3) the resolution that denied petitioner's motion for 
reconsideration.
[4]
 


The facts are as follows:


In August 1979, petitioner Tag Fibers, Inc. absorbed respondents from its 
predecessors, Smith Bell and Company, Conrad and Company and Columbian Rope and 
company as regular and permanent employees until the second week of February 
1983, when they were all terminated because of company losses.
[5]
 On February 11, 1983, petitioner Tag 
Fibers, Inc. re-hired respondents Ricardo Abanes and twenty (20) others 
effective on the day after the termination of their employment as piece-rate 
workers.
[6]
 


On July 25, 1983, when petitioners learned that respondents filed a complaint 
with the Regional Director, Region VII, Ministry of Labor & Employment for 
violation of the Minimum Wage Law and the granting of cost of living allowances, 
petitioners prohibited them from working.
[7]
 


On August 22, 1983, respondents filed with the Labor Arbiter a complaint for 
illegal dismissal with reinstatement and payment of backwages, cost of living 
allowances and other benefits.
[8]
 


On January 11, 1985, Labor Arbiter Felipe T. Garduque III rendered a decision 
disposing as follows: 




"WHEREFORE, responsive to all the foregoing, respondent TAG FIBER INC., 
and/or RAFAEL ZULUAGA, Jr., is hereby ordered to reinstate complainants to their 
respective former positions without loss of seniority rights and privileges and 
to pay jointly an severally the total sum of TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY 
EIGHT PESOS AND 68/100 (P10,858.68) to be deposited with this office within ten 
(10) days from receipt of this Decision for appropriate disposition.


"SO ORDERED.


"Cebu City, Philippines, 11 January 1985.


















"FELIPE T. GARDUQUE II














"Labor Arbiter"
[9]




On February 1, 1985, petitioners appealed to the National Labor Relations 
Commission (NLRC).
[10]


On February 17, 1986, the NLRC dismissed the appeal for lack of merit and 
affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter.
[11]


On May 2, 1986, petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration.
[12]
 However, the NLRC denied the motion in a 
resolution dated July 30, 1986.
[13]
 


On September 5, 1986, respondents filed with the Labor Arbiter a motion for 
the issuance of a writ of execution.
[14]


On October 15, 1986, petitioners filed with the Supreme Court a petition for 
certiorari for the nullification of the NLRC decision.
[15]
 


On October 5, 1987, the Court dismissed the petition for failure to 
sufficiently show that the respondent Commission had committed a grave abuse of 
discretion in rendering the questioned judgment.
[16]
 


Meantime, on January 22, 1987, Labor arbiter Alhambra Llenos Alfafara issued 
the corresponding writ of execution.
[17]




On February 15, 1993, Labor Arbiter Reynoso A. Belarmino issued another writ 
of execution of the January 15, 1985 decision of Labor Arbiter Felipe T. 
Garduque,
[18]
 in execution of which 
petitioners paid respondents the full amount of the monetary award of 
P10,858.68, but refused to reinstate the respondents.
[19]
 During the execution proceedings, 
respondents pressed for more backwages that was not provided in the Garduque 
decision. Consequently, the issue of reinstatement was set for a conference 
between the parties.
[20]


On March 23, 1993, the Labor Arbiter set the conference between the 
parties.
[21]
 However, on May 3, 1993, 
respondents filed a motion to direct petitioners to pay them backwages in view 
of petitioners' refusal to reinstate them.
[22]
 


On July 12, 1993, Labor Arbiter Reynoso a. Belarmino issued a resolution 
finding that strained relationship existed between the employer and employees 
and resolved to grant respondents the sum of P27,300.00 each or a total of 
P573,300, in the concept of separation pay of P2,730.00 each per year of service 
from February 1983 to June 1993.
[23]
 


On April 19, 1995, the NLRC modified the above-mentioned resolution of the 
Labor Arbiter.
[24]
 On May 11, 1995, 
petitioners filed with the NLRC a motion for reconsideration of the April 19, 
1995 resolution assailing the grant of separation pay in lieu of 
reinstatement.
[25]
 On May 26, 1995, the 
NLRC denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.
[26]
 


Hence, this petition.
[27]
 


Petitioners contend that the monetary aspect of the judgment dated January 
11, 1985 has been satisfied an the Labor Arbiter's authority to enforce judgment 
is merely ministerial; hence, the Labor Arbiter cannot modify or vary the final 
and executory decision of the NLRC.


We find the petition is meritorious.


Under Rule 39, Section 6, 1964 Revised Rules of Court, a judgment may be 
executed on motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry or from the 
date it becomes final and executory.


After the lapse of such time, and before it is barred by the statute of 
limitations, a judgment may be enforced by action.
[28]
 This rule applies to the case as the 
Rules of Court are applicable to labor cases in a suppletory capacity.
[29]
 


In this particular case, the January 11, 1985 decision of Labor Arbiter 
Felipe T. Garduque II became final after the NLRC denied petitioner's motion for 
reconsideration on July 30, 1986. Hence, the Labor Arbiter had no jurisdiction 
when he set a conference on March 23, 1993. The conference could no longer be 
lawfully convoked.


When the NLRC issued the resolution ordering the petitioner to pay separation 
pay from February 1983 to June 1993, it modified its own final judgment, and 
worse, acted without jurisdiction. The finality of a decision is a 
jurisdictional event that cannot be made to depend on the convenience of a 
party.
[30]
