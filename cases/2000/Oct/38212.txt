FIRST DIVISION [G.R. No. 131280. October 18, 2000] PEPE CATACUTAN and AURELIANA CATACUTAN, petitioners, vs. HEIRS OF NORMAN KADUSALE, HEIRS OF LITO AMANCIO and GIL B. IZON, respondents. D E C I S I O N YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:




YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


The issue raised in this petition for review on 
certiorari is whether or not a subsidiary writ of execution may issue 
against the employers of an accused, against whom a judgment of conviction had 
been entered, even when said employers never took part in the criminal 
proceedings where the accused was charged, tried and convicted.


Assailed in the instant petition is the August 12, 1997 
Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. SP No. 43617, directing the issuance of a subsidiary writ of execution 
against petitioners, as well as its October 9, 1997 Resolution,
[2]
 denying petitioners' Motion for 
Reconsideration.


The antecedent facts relevant to the issue before us may be 
summarized, as follows -


Petitioner Aureliana Catacutan is the registered owner and 
operator of a jeepney, driven by the accused Porferio Vendiola, which bumped a 
tricycle on April 11, 1991, in Banilad, Bacong, Negros Oriental, thereby causing 
the death of its driver, Norman Kadusale, and its passenger, Lito Amancio, and 
serious physical injuries to another passenger, respondent Gil B. Izon.


Respondents thus filed a criminal case against Porferio 
Vendiola, for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Double Homicide with Physical 
Injuries and Damages to Property on July 26, 1991, before the Regional Trial 
Court of Negros Oriental.


On December 1, 1995, the trial court rendered judgment,
[3]
 the dispositive portion of which reads as 
follows:




Wherefore, foregoing considered, this court is convinced beyond 
doubt that accused is guilty of negligence and imprudence under Article 365 of 
the Revised Penal Code in the collision which occurred in Banilad, Bacong, 
Negros Oriental on April 11, 1991 which claimed the lives of Norman Kadusale, 
the driver of the motortricycle, and Lito Amancio, a passenger of the 
motortricycle, and caused injury to Gil B. Izon.


He is therefore sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
prision 
correccional
 medium and maximum periods. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence 
Law, the accused is sentenced to one year eight months and one day of 
prision 
correccional
 as minimum to two years, four months and one day of 
prision 
correccional
 as maximum for each death to be served successively, and for 
the physical injuries suffered by Gil B. Izon, accused is ordered to suffer the 
penalty of thirty days of 
arresto mayor
 straight. He is likewise ordered 
to indemnify the heirs of Norman Kadusale and Lito Amancio in the amount of 
Fifty Thousand Pesos each victim; and to pay actual damages to:


Norman Kadusale or his heirs the amount of P170,543.24;


Lito Amancio or his heirs the amount of P38,394.35; and


Gil B. Izon, the amount of P23,454.00. 




SO ORDERED.
[4]




Accused Vendiola did not appeal the judgment of conviction. 
Instead, he applied for probation. Meanwhile, when the judgment became final and 
executory, respondents moved for the issuance of a writ of execution and the 
corresponding writ was issued by the trial court on April 24, 1996. However, per 
the Sheriff's Return of Service,
[5]
 dated 
July 3, 1996, the writ was unsatisfied as the accused had "nothing to pay off 
the damages in the decision."


On August 28, 1996, respondents filed a Motion for Subsidiary 
Writ of Execution
[6]
 before the trial 
court, praying that such writ be issued against petitioner Aureliana Catacutan 
as registered owner and operator of the jeepney driven by the accused when the 
collision occurred. Petitioner Aureliana Catacutan filed her Opposition
[7]
 thereto, arguing that she was never a 
party to the case and that to proceed against her would be in violation of the 
due process clause of the Constitution. Petitioner also argued that the 
subsidiary liability of the employer is not determined in the criminal case 
against the employee.


On October 3, 1996, the trial court issued an Order
[8]
 denying the said Motion for lack of merit. 
According to the trial court, it never acquired jurisdiction over petitioner 
Aureliana Catacutan since she was never impleaded as party to the case, and 
respondents' remedy was to file a separate case for damages. Respondents' Motion 
for Reconsideration was also denied on December 3, 1996.
[9]


Undaunted, respondents went on certiorari to the Court 
of Appeals. On August 12, 1997, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed 
Decision.


The issue raised in the instant petition is not new. It has 
been passed upon in the case of 
Yusay v. Adil
,
[10]
 where this Court held -




Petitioners contend that they were not informed of Criminal 
Case No. 11828 nor heard therein, in the matter of their alleged subsidiary 
liability and that they were thus denied their day in court, and that the court 
did not acquire jurisdiction over them.


We hold otherwise.Petitioners were given ample opportunity to 
present their side. The respondent judge admitted their "Urgent Ex Parte Motion 
for Time to File Necessary Pleadings." The respondent judge also issued an order 
suspending the execution of the writ dated 24 October 1980 and granting 
petitioners until 5 November 1980 within which to file their comment and/or 
opposition to the Motion for Issuance of the Writ of Subsidiary Execution. On 4 
November 1980, petitioners filed their Motion for Reconsideration of the order 
of 24 October 1980 and To Set Aside Subsidiary Writ of Execution. This was 
opposed by private respondent. On 21 November 1980, an order of denial of the 
Motion dated 4 November 1980 was issued. A second motion for reconsideration was 
filed by petitioners which was again opposed by private respondent. Petitioners 
filed their reply thereto. Acting on the pleadings, respondent judge issued a 
resolution denying petitioners' second motion for reconsideration.


As stated in Martinez v. Barredo: 


"The employer cannot be said to have been deprived of his day 
in court, because the situation before us is not one wherein the employer is 
sued for a primary liability under article 1903 of the Civil Code, but one in 
which enforcement is sought of a subsidiary civil liability incident to and 
dependent upon his driver's criminal negligence which is a proper issue to be 
tried and decided only in a criminal action. In other words, the employer 
becomes 
ipso facto
 subsidiarily liable upon his driver's conviction and 
upon proof of the latter's insolvency, in the same way that acquittal wipes out 
not only the employee's primary liability but also his employer's subsidiary 
liability for such criminal negligence (81 Phil. 1, 3, G.R. No. L-49308, May 13, 
1948, citing Almeida et al., vs. Abaroa, 8 Phil., 178, affirmed in 218 U.S. 476; 
54 Law ed., 1116; Wise & Co. vs. Larion, 45 Phil. 314, 320; Francisco vs. 
Onrubia, 46 Phil. 327; Province of Ilocos Sur vs. Tolentino, G.R. No. 34186, 56 
Phil., 829; Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. II, p. 403)."


The employer is, in substance and in effect, a party to the 
criminal case against his employee, considering the subsidiary liability imposed 
upon him by law. Thus: 


"It is true that an employer, strictly speaking, is not a party 
to the criminal case instituted against his employee but in substance and in 
effect he is considering the subsidiary liability imposed upon him by law. It is 
his concern, as well as his employee, to see to it that his interest be 
protected in the criminal case by taking virtual participation in the defense of 
his employee. He cannot leave him to his own fate because his failure is also 
his. And if because of his indifference or inaction the employee is convicted 
and damages are awarded against him, he cannot later be heard to complain, if 
brought to court for the enforcement of his subsidiary liability, that he was 
not given his day in court. It was not without purpose that this Court sounded 
the following stern warning:


"It is high time that the employer exercised the greatest care 
in selecting his employees, taking real and deep interest in their welfare; 
intervening in any criminal action brought against them by reason or as a result 
of the performance of their duties, if only in the way of giving them benefit of 
counsel; and consequently doing away with the practice of leaving them to their 
fates. If these be done, the American rule requiring notice on the part of the 
employer shall have been satisfied (Miranda vs. Malate Garage and Taxicab, Inc., 
99 Phil. 670, 675, citing Martinez vs. Barredo, 
supra
)." 



More recently, in the case of Basilio v. Court of 
Appeals
,
[11]
 the issuance of a 
subsidiary writ of execution against the employer of the accused therein was 
once more upheld, notwithstanding the non-participation of such employer in the 
criminal case against the accused. Instructive as it is on the issue at hand, we 
are reproducing hereunder this Court's pronouncement in said case, to wit -




The statutory basis for an employer's subsidiary liability is 
found in Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code. This liability is enforceable in 
the same criminal proceeding where the award is made. (Rules of Court, Rule 111, 
Sec. 1) However, before execution against an employer ensues, there must be a 
determination, in a hearing set for the purpose of 1) the existence of an 
employer-employee relationship; 2) that the employer is engaged in some kind of 
industry; 3) that the employee is adjudged guilty of the wrongful act and found 
to have committed the offense in the discharge of his duties (not necessarily 
any offense he commits "while" in the discharge of such duties); and 4) that 
said employee is insolvent. (Yonaha vs. CA, 255 SCRA 397, 402 [1996].)


In Vda. De Paman vs. SeÃ±eris, 115 SCRA 709, 714 (1982), the 
Court observed that the drawback in the enforcement of the subsidiary liability 
in the same criminal proceeding is that the alleged employer is not afforded due 
process. Not being a party to the case, he is not heard as to whether he is 
indeed the employer. Hence, we held:


To remedy the situation and thereby afford due process to the 
alleged employer, this Court directed the court a quo in Pajarito vs. SeÃ±eris 
(supra) to hear and decide in the same proceeding the subsidiary liability of 
the alleged owner and operator of the passenger bus. It was explained therein 
that the proceeding for the enforcement of the subsidiary liability may be 
considered as part of the proceeding for the execution of the judgment. A case 
in which an execution has been issued is regarded as still pending so that all 
proceedings on the execution are proceedings in the suit. (Vda. De Paman vs. 
SeÃ±eris, 115 SCRA 709, 714 [1982].)


There are two instances when the existence of an 
employer-employee relationship of an accused driver and the alleged vehicle 
owner may be determined. One during the criminal proceeding, and the other, 
during the proceeding for the execution of the judgment. In both instances, 
petitioner should be given the opportunity to be heard, which is the essence of 
due process. (National Federation of Labor vs. National Labor Relations 
Commissions, 283 SCRA 275, 284 [1997].)


Petitioner knew of the criminal case that was filed against 
accused because it was his truck that was involved in the incident. Further, it 
was the insurance company, with which his truck was insured, that provided the 
counsel for the accused, pursuant to the stipulations in their contract. 
Petitioner did not intervene in the criminal proceedings, despite knowledge, 
through counsel, that the prosecution adduced evidence to show employer-employee 
relationship. With the convict's application for probation, the trial court's 
judgment became final and executory. All told, it is our view that the lower 
court did not err when it found that petitioner was not denied due process. He 
had all his chances to intervene in the criminal proceedings, and prove that he 
was not the employer of the accused, but he chooses not to intervene at the 
appropriate time.


Petitioner was also given the opportunity during the 
proceedings for the enforcement of judgment. Even assuming that he was not 
properly notified of the hearing on the motion for execution of subsidiary 
liability, he was asked by the trial court to make an opposition thereto, which 
he did on October 17, 1991, where he properly alleged that there was no 
employer-employee relationship between him and accused and that the latter was 
not discharging any function in relation to his work at the time of the 
incident. In addition, counsel for private respondent filed and duly served on 
December 3, 1991, and December 9, 1991, respectively, a manifestation praying 
for the grant of the motion for execution. This was set for hearing on December 
13, 1991. However, counsel for petitioner did not appear. Consequently, the 
court ordered in open court that the matter be submitted for resolution. It was 
only on January 6, 1992, that the petitioner's counsel filed a 
counter-manifestation that belatedly attempted to contest the move of the 
private prosecutor for the execution of the civil liability. Thus, on April 7, 
1992, the trial court issued the Order granting the motion for execution of the 
subsidiary liability. Given the foregoing circumstances, we cannot agree with 
petitioner that the trial court denied him due process of law. Neither can we 
fault respondent appellant court for sustaining the judgment and orders of the 
trial court.


In the instant case, we find no reason why the subsidiary writ 
of execution issued against petitioner Aurelianana Catacutan should be set 
aside. To begin with, as in 
Yusay and Basilio
, 
supra
, petitioners 
cannot complain of having been deprived of their day in court. They were duly 
furnished a copy of respondents' Motion for Subsidiary Writ of Execution to 
which they filed their Opposition.


So, too, we find no good ground to order a separate hearing to 
determine the subsidiary liability of petitioner Aureliana Catacutan, as was 
ordered in the case of 
Pajarito v. SeÃ±eris,
 
supra
. To do so would 
entail a waste of both time and resources of the trial court as the requisites 
for the attachment of the subsidiary liability of the employer have already been 
established, to wit: 
First
, the existence of an employer-employee 
relationship.
[12]
 
Second
, the 
employer is engaged in some kind of industry, land transportation industry in 
this case as the jeep driven by accused was admittedly a passenger jeep.
[13]
 
Third
, the employee has already 
been adjudged guilty of the wrongful act and found to have committed the offense 
in the discharge of his duties.
[14]


Finally
, said employee is insolvent.
[15]


WHEREFORE
, based on the foregoing, the petition is 

DENIED
. No pronouncement as to costs.


SO ORDERED.
