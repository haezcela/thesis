PANGANIBAN, J.:


Under the Public Land Act as amended, only titles to 
alienable and 
disposable
 lands of the public domain may be judicially confirmed. Unless a 
public land is reclassified and declared as such, occupation thereof in the 
concept of owner, no matter how long ago, cannot confer ownership or possessory 
rights. A suit for the reversion of such property to the State may be instituted 
only by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG). 


The Case


Before us is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 assailing the August 
28, 1998 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of 
Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 52048, the decretal portion of which reads as 
follows:
[2]




"ACCORDINGLY, for want of merit, the appeal is 
DENIED
 and the 
challenged Decision dated 26 November 1993 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 
2, Balanga, Bataan, is 
AFFIRMED
. No costs." 


The affirmed Decision
[3]
 of the 
Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled on the following: (1) Land Registration Case 
No. N-340, filed in 1977 for confirmation of respondent's title to three parcels 
of land; and (2) Civil Case No. 4739, filed in 1981 for cancellation of 
petitioners' Sales Patents and Transfer Certificates of Title covering two of 
the said lots. The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads:
[4]
 




"ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered: I. In Civil Case No. 4739 - 



Ordering the cancellation of Sales Patent Nos. 5387 and 5388 as well as 
Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. T-43298 and T-44205 in the names of [herein 
petitioner-]spouses Geminiano de Ocampo and Amparo de Ocampo and x x x Pedro 
Santos and Crisanta Santos.


Taking judicial cognizance of the decision in Civil Case No. 3769, which 
ordered the cancellation of Free Patent Nos. 522697 and 502977 as well as 
Original Certificate of Title Nos. 296 and 297, which decision has already 
become final and executory;


Ordering [Petitioners] Geminiano de Ocampo and Amparo de Ocampo and x x x 
Pedro Santos and Crisanta Santos to pay jointly and severally to the plaintiffs 
attorney's fees in the sum of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) and the costs of 
suit. 




II. In Land Registration Case No. N-340 -


Confirming [herein respondents'] title [to] the land subject of registration 
and ordering the registration thereof in the names of [Respondent] Teofilo D. 
Ojerio, of legal age, Filipino, married to Bella V. Ojerio and a resident of 
Cabcaben, Mariveles, Bataan - Â½ share; and Cecilia P. Arlos, Jose P. Arlos, 
Gloria P. Arlos, Luisito P. Arlos, all of legal age, Filipinos, single and 
residents of 500-A, Fifth Avenue corner Baltazar Street, Grace Park, Caloocan 
City, Metro Manila, and Alberto U. Arlos, minor, Filipino, and a resident of 
500-A, Fifth Avenue corner Baltazar Street, Grace Park, Caloocan City, Metro 
Manila - Â½ share; and


As soon as this decision becomes final and executory, let an order for the 
issuance of the corresponding decrees be issued. 




SO ORDERED." 


The Facts


The undisputed facts are quoted by the CA from the RTC judgment, as 
follows:
[5]
 




"On 14 April 1977, Federico S. Arlos and Teofilo D. Ojerio filed an 
application for registration, docketed as Land Registration Case No. N-340, 
wherein they seek judicial confirmation of their titles [to] three parcels of 
land, namely: (1) a parcel of land covered by SGS 4140 [PLAN] with an area of 
226,105 square meters; (2) a parcel of land identified as Lot 1, SGS 41241 
[PLAN] with an area of 111,333 square meters; and (3) a parcel of land 
identified as Lot 2, SGS 4141 [PLAN] with an area of 63,811 square meters, all 
located at Cabcaben, Mariveles, Bataan, and having a total area of 401,159 
square meters or 40.1159 hectares. 


"Spouses Geminiano de Ocampo and Amparo De Ocampo and spouses Pedro Santos 
and Crisanta Santos opposed the application for registration, alleging that they 
are the co-owners of Lots 1 and 2 of Plan SGS 3062, situated at Cabcaben, 
Mariveles, Bataan, and their ownership is evidenced by Transfer Certificate of 
Title Nos. T-43298 and T-44205, and that they became owners of said lots by 
purchase from the government through sales patents. 


"The Republic of the Philippines also opposed the application, contending 
that neither the applicants nor their predecessors-in-interests have been in 
open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the lands 
in question for at least 30 years immediately preceding the filing of the 
application; and that the parcels of land applied for are portions of the public 
domain belonging to the Republic of the Philippines not subject to private 
appropriation. 


"Spouses Placido Manalo and Rufina Enriquez and spouses Armando Manalo and 
Jovita Baron also opposed the application for registration. 


"Almost four years after the filing of the land registration case or, to be 
exact, on 20 February 1981, applicant Arlos and his spouse, Mary Alcantara 
Arlos, and applicant Ojerio and his spouse Bella V. Ojerio, filed Civil Case No. 
4739, seeking to cancel; (1) the free patent title of defendants-spouses Placido 
Manalo and Rufina Enriquez, that is, Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 
296-Bataan, covering Lot, 1, Plan F-(III-4) 508-D with an area of 155,772 square 
meters, and Lot 2, same plan, containing an area of 43,089 square meters, or a 
total area of 198,861 square meters or 19.8861 hectares; (2) the free patent 
title of defendants Armando Manalo and Jovito Baron, that is, OCT No. 
297-Bataan, covering Lot, 1, F-(III-4) 510-D with an area of 72,065 square 
meters or 7.2065 hectares; and (3) the sales patent title of defendants-spouses 
Geminiano de Ocampo and Amparo de Ocampo and defendants-spouses Pedro Santos and 
Crisanta Santos, that is, Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. T-44205-Bataan with 
an area of 225,011 square meters or 22.5011 hectares, and T-43298-Bataan with an 
area of 111,333 square meters or 11.1333 hectares.


"In the Order dated 31 July 1991 of the RTC, Branch 1, Balanga, Bataan, Civil 
Case No. 4739 which was then assigned to said Branch was ordered consolidated 
with the land registration cases assigned to Branch 2.


"Of relevance to this case on appeal is the Decision of the Supreme Court 
dated 26 April 1989 in G.R. 64753 involving Civil Case No. 3769 entitled 
`
Spouses de Ocampo et al. v. Manalo, et al
.' which annulled the free 
patent titles of the spouses Manalo and declared as valid the sales patent title 
issued in favor of the spouses De Ocampo and spouses Santos involving the same 
properties subject of this appeal." 


Ruling of the Court of Appeals


Affirming the factual findings of the trial court, the CA ruled that 
petitioners had failed to comply with the Public Land Act, which required sales 
patent applicants to be the actual occupants and cultivators of the land. It 
held that the testimonies of petitioners, which were "incongruous with reality," 
bolstered the "finding that [they had] never occupied, cultivated or made 
improvements on the property." It explained: 




"On the basis of its own findings, the trial court, after evaluating the 
evidence presented, concluded that [herein respondents] and their 
predecessors-in-interest were in actual possession of the subject lands in 1947 
and continuously up to the present. In contrast, the checkered testimonies of 
[petitioners] reveal that they have never been in possession of the lands. And 
because of the absence of the actual occupancy on their part, the sales patents 
and titles issued in their favor are null and void citing therein the ruling in 

Republic v. Mina
 (114 SCRA 946) that `the alleged misrepresentation of 
the applicant that he had been occupying and cultivating the land are sufficient 
grounds to nullify the patent and title under Section 9 of the Public Land 
Laws.' 


"On this particular note, we find no reason to disturb the factual findings 
of the trial court. x x x."
[6]




Debunking petitioners' reliance on 
Manalo v. IAC and de Ocampo
,
[7]
 the CA ratiocinated as follows: 




"[Herein respondents] do not challenge the Decision of the High Court dated 
26 April 1989 in GR No. 64753 which annulled the free patent titles of 
defendants-appellants Manalos and granted the issuance of sales patent titles of 
[Petitioners] De Ocampos and Santoses. 


"What is being disputed is that the issuance of the sales patents of the 
subject property in favor of the Santoses and the De Ocampos was allegedly 
tainted by fraud and misrepresentation on their part by misrepresenting 
themselves to be actual occupants of the subject properties when in fact the 
subject properties were being actually occupied by the [respondents] since 1947 
way back when the land still formed part of the military reservation and further 
on when it was declared to be public agricultural land. x x x."
[8]
 


Hence, this Petition.
[9]




The Issues


In their Memorandum, petitioners submit the following issues for our 
consideration:
[10]
 


"I




Whether or not the Court of Appeals committed an error in disregarding the 
Decision of the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 64753 entitled, `Placido Manalo, et 
al. vs. Spouses Geminiano de Ocampo and Amparo de Ocampo, et al.,' wherein the 
validity and legality of petitioners' TCT No. T-44205 and TCT No. T-43298 
[pertaining to] the land in dispute were upheld.


"II 




Whether or not the Court of Appeals committed an error in ordering the 
cancellation of petitioners' Sales Patent as well as TCT Nos. T-43298 and 
T-44205 considering that private respondents are not the proper party to 
institute the action for annulment of petitioners' titles [to] the lots. 



"III




Whether or not the Court of Appeals committed an error in ruling that 
petitioners committed an act of misrepresentation in their Application for Sales 
Patent.


"IV




Whether or not the Court of Appeals committed an error in ordering 
petitioners to pay private respondents the amount of P50,000.00 representing 
attorney's fees." In short, petitioners ask this Court to determine the 
propriety of (1) the registration of respondents' title under the Public Land 
Act and (2) the cancellation of petitioners' Sales Patents and Transfer 
Certificates of Title (TCTs). 


The Court's Ruling


The Petition is meritorious. 


First Issue:
Registration of Respondents' 
Title


Respondents' application for registration of title to the three parcels of 
land that were once part of the public domain is governed by the Public Land 
Act,
[11]
 the pertinent portion of which 
reads: 




"SEC. 48. The following described citizens of the Philippines, occupying 
lands of the public domain or claiming to own such lands or an interest therein, 
but whose titles have not been perfected or completed, may apply to the Court of 
First Instance of the province where the land is located for confirmation of 
their claims and the issuance of a certificate of title therefor, under the Land 
Registration Act, to wit: 










x x x 




x x x 




x x x 




(b) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors in interest have 
been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of 
agricultural lands of the public domain, under a 
bona fide
 claim of 
acquisition or ownership, for at least thirty years immediately preceding the 
filing of the application for confirmation of title except when prevented by war 
or force majeure. These shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the 
conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be entitled to a 
certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter.










"x x x




x x x 




x x x"


Respondents claim that they purchased the subject lots in 1967 from Bernardo 
and Arsenio Obdin,
[12]
 who in turn had 
been in possession of the property since 1947. Hence, when the former filed 
their application for registration in 1977, they and their 
predecessors-in-interest had been occupying and cultivating, in the concept of 
owners, the said parcels of land for at least 30 years, as required by the 
Public Land Act. 


We are not convinced. 
First
, a title may be judicially confirmed under 
Section 48 of the Public Land Act only if it pertains to 
alienable
 lands 
of the public domain.
[13]
 Unless such 
assets are reclassified and considered disposable and alienable, occupation 
thereof in the concept of owner, no matter how long cannot ripen into ownership 
and be registered as a title. Verily, Presidential Decree No. 1073
[14]
 clarified Section 48 (b) of the Public 
Land Act by specifically declaring that the latter applied only to alienable and 
disposable lands of the public domain.
[15]


In the present case, the disputed land which was formerly a part of a US 
military reservation that had been turned over to the Philippine government in 
1965, was declared disposable and alienable only in 1971. In 
Manalo v. IAC 
and de Ocampo
,
[16]
 a suit involving 
the 
same
 parcel of land and instituted by herein petitioners against 
other claimants, the Court held: 


"As correctly pointed out by the appellate court in its questioned 
decision:




`x x x. It is not correct to say that when the U.S. Military Reservation in 
Bataan, of which the land in question forms part, was turned over to the 
Philippine government, the same automatically became a disposable land of the 
public domain. The ownership and control over said reservation was transferred 
to the Philippine government, but its nature as a military reservation remained 
unchanged. 
Said parcels of land became a disposable land of public domain 
only on May 19, 1971, per certification of the Bureau of Forestry (Project No. 
4-A, C-C. Map No 26-40).
 Its disposition only by sale was duly authorized 
pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act No. 274. If the land in question 
became immediately disposable upon its turn over to the Philippine government in 
1965, then why, it may be asked, was it certified disposable only in 1971. 

This Court is of the conclusion that this land above referred to continued to 
be a military reservation land while in the custody of the Philippine government 
until it was certified alienable in 1971."
 (Emphasis supplied.) 



Second
, respondents and their predecessors-in-interest could not have 
occupied the subject property from 1947 until 1971 when the land was declared 
alienable and disposable, because it was a military reservation at the time. 
Hence, it was not subject to occupation, entry or settlement. This is clear from 
Sections 83 and 88 of the Public Land Act, which provide as follows:




"SEC. 83. Upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Commerce, the President may designate by proclamation any tract or tracts of 
land of the public domain as reservations for the use of the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines or of any of its branches, or of the inhabitants thereof, in 
accordance with regulations prescribed for this purpose, or for quasi-public 
uses or purposes when the public interest requires it, including reservations 
for highways, rights of way for railroads, hydraulic power sites, irrigation 
systems, communal pastures or 
leguas comunales
, public parks, public 
quarries, public fishponds, working-men's village and other improvements for the 
public benefit.


SEC. 88. The tract or tracts of land reserved under the provisions of section 
eighty-three shall be non-alienable and 
shall not be subject to occupation, 
entry, sale, lease, or other disposition until again declared under the 
provision of this Act or by proclamation of the President."
 (Emphasis 
supplied.)


Verily, in 
Manalo, 
the Court debunked therein petitioners' similar 
argument that they had been occupying the property since 1944. It ruled in this 
wise:




"The big tract of land in Mariveles, Bataan to which the parcels of land 
involved in the case belong was formerly a portion of the US Military 
Reservation in Mariveles, Bataan which was turned over to the Philippine 
Government only on December 22, 1965 (Republic of the Philippines v. Court of 
Appeals et al., No. L-39473, April 30, 1979, 89 SCRA 648). Under the situation, 
the Court seriously doubts whether Placido Mapa and their 
predecessors-in-interest could have been in possession of the land since 1944 as 
they claimed:




`Lands covered by reservation are not subject to entry, and no lawful 
settlement on them can be acquired (Republic of the Philippines v. Hon. Court of 
Appeals, et al., No. 14912, September 30, 1976, 73 SCRA 146).'" 



We reiterate that the land was declared alienable only in 1971; hence, 
respondents have not satisfied the thirty-year requirement under the Public Land 
Act. Moreover, they could not have occupied the property for thirty years, 
because it formed part of a military reservation. Clearly then, their 
application for the registration of their titles was erroneously granted by the 
appellate and the trial courts. 


Second Issue: 
Cancellation of Petitioners' 
Titles


Petitioners claim that their titles can no longer be challenged, because "it 
is a rule that the Torrens Title issued on the basis of a free patent becomes 
indefeasible as one which was judicially secured upon registration upon 
expiration of one year from date of issuance of patent."
[17]


Petitioners further contend that the action for the cancellation of their 
Sales Patents and TCTs should have been initiated by the solicitor general, not 
by herein respondents, pursuant to Section 101 of the Public Land Act, which we 
quote:




"SEC. 101. All actions for the reversion to the Government of lands of the 
public domain or improvements thereon shall be instituted by the Solicitor 
General or the officer acting in his stead, in the proper courts, in the name of 
the Republic of the Philippines."


Respondents argue, however, that the present proceedings are not for 
reversion, but for reconveyance. Hence, they have the personality to file the 
present suit.


We are not persuaded by respondents' argument. In an action for reconveyance, 
"the decree of registration is respected as incontrovertible. What is sought 
instead is the transfer of the property, in this case the title thereof, which 
has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in another person's name, to its 
rightful owner or to one with a better right. That is what reconveyance is all 
about."
[18]
 


Reconveyance, however, is not available to respondents, because they have not 
shown a title better than that of petitioners. As earlier shown, the former have 
not proven any title that may be judicially confirmed.


Moreover, respondents' invocation of 
Heirs of Nagano v. CA
[19]
 
must be rejected. In that case, 
the Court noted that the allegations in the Complaint, which were deemed 
admitted for the purpose of resolving the Motion to Dismiss, were "an assertion 
that the lot is private land, or that even assuming it was part of the public 
domain, private respondents had already acquired imperfect title thereto under 
Section 48 (b) of CA No. 141 x x x." Hence, the Court ruled that respondents, 
not the OSG, were the proper parties to file the suit.


In the present case, we reiterate that respondents failed to show entitlement 
to the land. They have not established that they are the rightful owners of the 
property; or at least, that they, not petitioners, have a better right 
thereto.


Respondents vigorously contend that the Sales Patents were fraudulently 
obtained by petitioners, who have allegedly failed to prove the requisite actual 
occupation of the land in question. The former cite several portions of the 
transcript of stenographic notes, showing that the latter have not actually 
occupied or cultivated the property.


The Court, however, finds that a ruling on the veracity of these factual 
averments would be improper in this Decision. If petitioners' Sales Patents and 
TCTs were in fact fraudulently obtained, the suit to recover the disputed 
property should be filed by the State through the Office of the Solicitor 
General. Since petitioners' titles originated from a grant by the government, 
their cancellation is a matter between the grantor and the grantee.
[20]
 At the risk of being repetitive, we 
stress that respondents have no personality to "recover" the property, because 
they have not shown that they are the rightful owners thereof. 


WHEREFORE

GRANTED

 No pronouncement as to costs.


Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the Office of the Solicitor General

Patents and Certificates of Titles in the name of herein petitioners.
