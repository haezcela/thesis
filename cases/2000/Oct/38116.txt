THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 136490, October 19, 2000 ]


BRENDA B. MARCOS, PETITIONER, VS. WILSON G. MARCOS, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


Psychological incapacity, as a ground for declaring the nullity of a 
marriage, may be established by the totality of evidence presented. There is no 
requirement, however, that the respondent should be examined by a physician or a 
psychologist as a 
conditio sine qua non
 for such declaration. 


The Case


Before us is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the 
Rules of Court, assailing the July 24, 1998 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV 
No. 55588, which disposed as follows: 




"WHEREFORE, the contested decision is set aside and the marriage between the 
parties is hereby declared valid."
[2]




Also challenged by petitioner is the December 3, 1998 CA Resolution denying 
her Motion for Reconsideration.


Earlier, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) had ruled thus: 




"WHEREFORE, the marriage between petitioner Brenda B. Marcos and respondent 
Wilson G. Marcos, solemnized on September 6, 1982 in Pasig City is declared null 
and void 
ab initio
 pursuant to Art. 36 of the Family Code. The conjugal 
properties, if any, is dissolved [sic] in accordance with Articles 126 and 129 
of the same Code in relation to Articles 50, 51 and 52 relative to the delivery 
of the legitime of [the] parties' children. In the best interest and welfare of 
the minor children, their custody is granted to petitioner subject to the 
visitation rights of respondent.


"Upon finality of this Decision, furnish copy each to the Office of the Civil 
Registrar of Pasig City where the marriage was solemnized, the National Census 
and Statistics Office, Manila and the Register of Deeds of Mandaluyong City for 
their appropriate action consistent with this Decision.


"SO ORDERED." 


The Facts


The facts as found by the Court of Appeals are as follows:




"It was established during the trial that the parties were married twice: (1) 
on September 6, 1982 which was solemnized by Judge Eriberto H. Espiritu at the 
Municipal Court of Pasig (Exh. A); and (2) on May 8, 1983 which was solemnized 
by Rev. Eduardo L. Eleazar, Command Chaplain, at the Presidential Security 
Command Chapel in MalacaÃ±ang Park, Manila (Exh. A-1). Out of their marriage, 
five (5) children were born (Exhs. B, C, D, E and F).


"Appellant Wilson G. Marcos joined the Armed Forces of the Philippines in 
1973. Later on, he was transferred to the Presidential Security Command in 
MalacaÃ±ang during the Marcos Regime. Appellee Brenda B. Marcos, on the other 
hand, joined the Women's Auxilliary Corps under the Philippine Air Force in 
1978. After the Edsa Revolution, both of them sought a discharge from the 
military service.


"They first met sometime in 1980 when both of them were assigned at the 
MalacaÃ±ang Palace, she as an escort of Imee Marcos and he as a Presidential 
Guard of President Ferdinand Marcos. Through telephone conversations, they 
became acquainted and eventually became sweethearts.


"After their marriage on September 6, 1982, they resided at No. 1702 Daisy 
Street, Hulo Bliss, Mandaluyong, a housing unit which she acquired from the 
Bliss Development Corporation when she was still single.


"After the downfall of President Marcos, he left the military service in 1987 
and then engaged in different business ventures that did not however prosper. As 
a wife, she always urged him to look for work so that their children would see 
him, instead of her, as the head of the family and a good provider. Due to his 
failure to engage in any gainful employment, they would often quarrel and as a 
consequence, he would hit and beat her. He would even force her to have sex with 
him despite her weariness. He would also inflict physical harm on their children 
for a slight mistake and was so severe in the way he chastised them. Thus, for 
several times during their cohabitation, he would leave their house. In 1992, 
they were already living separately.


"All the while, she was engrossed in the business of selling "magic uling" 
and chickens. While she was still in the military, she would first make 
deliveries early in the morning before going to MalacaÃ±ang. When she was 
discharged from the military service, she concentrated on her business. Then, 
she became a supplier in the Armed Forces of the Philippines until she was able 
to put up a trading and construction company, NS Ness Trading and Construction 
Development Corporation.


"The 'straw that broke the camel's back' took place on October 16, 1994, when 
they had a bitter quarrel. As they were already living separately, she did not 
want him to stay in their house anymore. On that day, when she saw him in their 
house, she was so angry that she lambasted him. He then turned violent, 
inflicting physical harm on her and even on her mother who came to her aid. The 
following day, October 17, 1994, she and their children left the house and 
sought refuge in her sister's house.


"On October 19, 1994, she submitted herself [to] medical examination at the 
Mandaluyong Medical Center where her injuries were diagnosed as contusions (Exh. 
G, Records, 153).


"Sometime in August 1995, she together with her two sisters and driver, went 
to him at the Bliss unit in Mandaluyong to look for their missing child, Niko. 
Upon seeing them, he got mad. After knowing the reason for their unexpected 
presence, he ran after them with a samurai and even [beat] her driver.


"At the time of the filing of this case, she and their children were renting 
a house in Camella, ParaÃ±aque, while the appellant was residing at the Bliss 
unit in Mandaluyong.


"In the case study conducted by Social Worker Sonia C. Millan, the children 
described their father as cruel and physically abusive to them (Exh. UU, 
Records, pp. 85-100).


"The appellee submitted herself to psychologist Natividad A. Dayan, Ph.D., 
for psychological evaluation (Exh. YY, Records, pp. 207-216), while the 
appellant on the other hand, did not.


"The court 
a quo
 found the appellant to be psychologically 
incapacitated to perform his marital obligations mainly because of his failure 
to find work to support his family and his violent attitude towards appellee and 
their children, x x x."
[3]


Ruling of the Court of Appeals


Reversing the RTC, the CA held that psychological incapacity had not been 
established by the totality of the evidence presented. It ratiocinated in this 
wise: 




"Essential in a petition for annulment is the allegation of the root cause of 
the spouse's psychological incapacity which should also be medically or 
clinically identified, sufficiently proven by experts and clearly explained in 
the decision. The incapacity must be proven to be existing at the time of the 
celebration of the marriage and shown to be medically or clinically permanent or 
incurable. It must also be grave enough to bring about the disability of the 
parties to assume the essential obligations of marriage as set forth in Articles 
68 to 71 and Articles 220 to 225 of the Family Code and such non-complied 
marital obligations must similarly be alleged in the petition, established by 
evidence and explained in the decision.


"In the case before us, the appellant was not subjected to any psychological 
or psychiatric evaluation. The psychological findings about the appellant by 
psychiatrist Natividad Dayan were based only on the interviews conducted with 
the appellee. Expert evidence by qualified psychiatrists and clinical 
psychologists is essential if only to prove that the parties were or any one of 
them was mentally or psychically ill to be truly incognitive of the marital 
obligations he or she was assuming, or as would make him or her x x x unable to 
assume them. In fact, he offered testimonial evidence to show that he [was] not 
psychologically incapacitated. The root cause of his supposed incapacity was not 
alleged in the petition, nor medically or clinically identified as a 
psychological illness or sufficiently proven by an expert. Similarly, there is 
no evidence at all that would show that the appellant was suffering from an 
incapacity which [was] psychological or mental - not physical to the extent that 
he could not have known the obligations he was assuming: that the incapacity 
[was] grave, ha[d] preceded the marriage and [was] incurable."
[4]
 


Hence, this Petition.
[5]
 


Issues


In her Memorandum,
[6]
 petitioner 
presents for this Court's consideration the following issues: 


 




"I. Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals could set aside the 
findings by the Regional Trial Court of psychological incapacity of a respondent 
in a Petition for declaration of nullity of marriage simply because the 
respondent did not subject himself to psychological evaluation. 3


II. Whether or not the totality of evidence presented and the demeanor of all 
the witnesses should be the basis of the determination of the merits of the 
Petition."
[7]


The Court's Ruling


We agree with petitioner that the personal medical or psychological 
examination of respondent is not a requirement for a declaration of 
psychological incapacity. Nevertheless, the totality of the evidence she 
presented does not show such incapacity. 


Preliminary Issue:
Need for Personal Medical 
Examination
 


Petitioner contends that the testimonies and the results of various tests 
that were submitted to determine respondent's psychological incapacity to 
perform the obligations of marriage should not have been brushed aside by the 
Court of Appeals, simply because respondent had not taken those tests himself. 
Petitioner adds that the CA should have realized that under the circumstances, 
she had no choice but to rely on other sources of information in order to 
determine the psychological capacity of respondent, who had refused to submit 
himself to such tests.


In Republic v. CA and Molina,
[8]
 the 
guidelines governing the application and the interpretation of 
psychological 
incapacity 
referred to in Article 36 of the Family Code
[9]
 were laid down by this Court as follows: 





"1) The burden of proof to show the nullity of the marriage belongs to the 
plaintiff. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of the existence and 
continuation of the marriage and against its dissolution and nullity. This is 
rooted in the fact that both our Constitution and our laws cherish the validity 
of marriage and unity of the family. Thus, our Constitution devotes an entire 
Article on the Family, recognizing it 'as the foundation of the nation.' It 
decrees marriage as legally 'inviolable,' thereby protecting it from dissolution 
at the whim of the parties. Both the family and marriage are to be 'protected' 
by the state.










x x x




x x x 




x x x




2) The root cause of the psychological incapacity must be: (a) medically or 
clinically identified, (b) alleged in the complaint, (c) sufficiently proven by 
experts and (d) clearly explained in the decision. Article 36 of the Family Code 
requires that the incapacity must be psychological - not physical, although its 
manifestations and/or symptoms may be physical. The evidence must convince the 
court that the parties, or one of them, was mentally or psychically ill to such 
an extent that the person could not have known the obligations he was assuming, 
or knowing them, could not have given valid assumption thereof. Although no 
example of such incapacity need be given here so as not to limit the application 
of the provision under the principle of 
ejusdem generis
, nevertheless 
such root cause must be identified as a psychological illness and its 
incapacitating nature fully explained. Expert evidence may be given by qualified 
psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.


3) The incapacity must be proven to be existing at 'the time of the 
celebration' of the marriage. The evidence must show that the illness was 
existing when the parties exchanged their 'I do's.' The manifestation of the 
illness need not be perceivable at such time, but the illness itself must have 
attached at such moment, or prior thereto.


4) Such incapacity must also be shown to be medically or clinically permanent 
or incurable. Such incurability may be absolute or even relative only in regard 
to the other spouse, not necessarily absolutely against everyone of the same 
sex. Furthermore, such incapacity must be relevant to the assumption of marriage 
obligations, not necessarily to those not related to marriage, like the exercise 
of a profession or employment in a job. Hence, a pediatrician may be effective 
in diagnosing illnesses of children and prescribing medicine to cure them but 
not be psychologically capacitated to procreate, bear and raise his/her own 
children as an essential obligation of marriage.


5) Such illness must be grave enough to bring about the disability of the 
party to assume the essential obligations of marriage. Thus, 'mild 
characteriological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts 
cannot be accepted as root causes. The illness must be shown as downright 
incapacity or inability, not a refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill 
will. In other words, there is a natal or supervening disabling factor in the 
person, an adverse integral element in the personality structure that 
effectively incapacitates the person from really accepting and thereby complying 
with the obligations essential to marriage.


6) The essential marital obligations must be those embraced by Articles 68 up 
to 71 of the Family Code as regards the husband and wife as well as Articles 
220, 221 and 225 of the same Code in regard to parents and their children. Such 
non-complied marital obligation(s) must also be stated in the petition, proven 
by evidence and included in the text of the decision.


7) Interpretations given by the National Appellate Matrimonial Tribunal of 
the Catholic Church in the Philippines, while not controlling or decisive, 
should be given great respect by our courts.

(8) The trial court must order the prosecuting attorney or fiscal and the 
Solicitor General to appear as counsel for the state. No decision shall be 
handed down unless the Solicitor General issues a certification, which will be 
quoted in the decision, briefly stating therein his reasons for his agreement or 
opposition, as the case may be, to the petition. The Solicitor General, along 
with the prosecuting attorney, shall submit to the court such certification 
within fifteen (15) days from the date the case is deemed submitted for 
resolution of the court. The Solicitor General shall discharge the equivalent 
function of the 
defensor vinculi
 contemplated under Canon 1095."
[10]
 


The guidelines incorporate the three basic requirements earlier mandated by 
the Court in 
Santos v. Court of Appeals:
[11]
 
"psychological incapacity must be 
characterized by (a) gravity (b) juridical antecedence, and (c) incurability." 
The foregoing guidelines do not require that a physician examine the person to 
be declared psychologically incapacitated. In fact, the root cause may be 
"medically 
or clinically 
identified." What is important is the presence 
of evidence that can adequately establish the party's 
psychological
 
condition. For indeed, if the totality of evidence presented is enough to 
sustain a finding of psychological incapacity, then actual medical examination 
of the person concerned need not be resorted to. 


Main Issue: 
Totality of Evidence 
Presented
 


The main question, then, is whether the totality of the evidence presented in 
the present case -- including the testimonies of petitioner, the common 
children, petitioner's sister and the social worker -- was enough to sustain a 
finding that respondent was psychologically incapacitated.


We rule in the negative. Although this Court is sufficiently convinced that 
respondent failed to provide material support to the family and may have 
resorted to physical abuse and abandonment, the totality of his acts does not 
lead to a conclusion of psychological incapacity on his part. There is 
absolutely no showing that his "defects" were already present at the inception 
of the marriage or that they are incurable.


Verily, the behavior of respondent can be attributed to the fact that he had 
lost his job and was not gainfully employed for a period of more than six years. 
It was during this period that he became intermittently drunk, failed to give 
material and moral support, and even left the family home.


Thus, his alleged psychological illness was traced only to said period and 
not to the inception of the marriage. Equally important, there is no evidence 
showing that his condition is incurable, especially now that he is gainfully 
employed as a taxi driver.


Article 36 of the Family Code, we stress, is not to be confused with a 
divorce law that cuts the marital bond at the time the causes therefor manifest 
themselves. It refers to a serious psychological illness afflicting a party even 
before the celebration of the marriage. It is a malady so grave and so permanent 
as to deprive one of awareness of the duties and responsibilities of the 
matrimonial bond one is about to assume. These marital obligations are those 
provided under Articles 68 to 71, 220, 221 and 225 of the Family Code.


Neither is Article 36 to be equated with legal separation, in which the 
grounds need not be rooted in psychological incapacity but on physical violence, 
moral pressure, moral corruption, civil interdiction, drug addiction, habitual 
alcoholism, sexual infidelity, abandonment and the like.
[12]
 At best, the evidence presented by 
petitioner refers only to grounds for legal separation, not for declaring a 
marriage void.


Because Article 36 has been abused as a convenient divorce law, this Court 
laid down the procedural requirements for its invocation in 
Molina. 

Petitioner, however, has not faithfully observed them. In sum, this Court 
cannot declare the dissolution of the marriage for failure of petitioner to show 
that the alleged psychological incapacity is characterized by gravity, juridical 
antecedence and incurability; and for her failure to observe the guidelines 
outlined in 
Molina
.
