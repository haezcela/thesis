Thus, the Motion for Reconsideration was resolved only on February 10, 1998.

"
JUDGE EFREN A. LAMORENA
RTC, Branch 36, Santiago City




"Judge Efren A. Lamorena, RTC, Branch 36, Santiago City, submitted his reasons (pp. 60-61, rollo) for the delay in the resolution of some cases in his sala as follows:




"1. Due to his health problem (a vision impairment) caused by a cataract disease clouding his eyes with intense pain and compromising as it compromised his eyesight thus, preventing him to carry his normal work; (Judge Lamorena informed that as soon as his economic life improves, he will try to submit himself for an eye operation. Just recently he suffered a stroke).


"2. His health problem is compounded by the hard working condition of his office. It is very small and crowded. All the equipments of the court are stocked without any airconditioning unit. (The Team noted that Judge Lamorena has no court and staff room.) He conducts his trials at the corridors and shares the room with the Office of the Clerk of Court.


"3. His sala was designated to try heinous crimes;


"4. He likewise revealed that he commutes daily in a public transportation at a distance of seventy two (72) kilometers one way with a travel time of at least four (4) hours a day.


"On November 12, 1998 (p. 80, rollo) Judge Lamorena informed that of the thirty-one (31) cases mentioned in Item No. 5-a, only six (6) cases remain to be decided or resolved, while seven (7) of the cases listed in Item No. 5-c are likewise being resolved.


"Judge Lamorena informed that had it not been for the Super Typhoon Iliang and later Loleng whose destructive fury devastated the province of Isabela, including his residence, he would have resolved already all the said cases.


"He likewise manifested that he is already ready to resume trying cases in his sala.


"It is should be noted that Judge Lamorena however did not furnish this Office copies of his decisions. 


"
JUDGE SERGIO A. PLAN
 
MTC, Cauayan, Isabela 




"In his letter dated August 27, 1998 (p. 68, rollo), Judge Plan simply informed the status of the following cases:




"1. 
Civil Case No. 1706
 - Not submitted for decision because defendants have not been served with summons as they could not be located. Due to the inaction of the plaintiff, the case is ordered archived. 


"2. 
Civil Case Nos. 1894 & 1896
 - The Court archived said cases due to the inaction of the plaintiff for unreasonable length of time. 


"3. 
Civil Case No. 1932
 - Not immediately acted upon due to the withdrawal of counsel Atty. Agustin Ladera for the plaintiff and substituted by new counsel Atty. Bernard Olalia who has not filed a formal appearance as counsel for the plaintiff and to have the motion to declare defendants in default set for hearing with notice to the defendants. Hence, due to the inaction of the plaintiff, the Court archived the case.


"4. 
Civil Cases Nos. 1946 & 2034
 - Not immediately decided due to the failure of the plaintiff to submit the exhibits offered as evidence and as the Court was about to archive the cases, the plaintiff submitted the required exhibits and thereupon, the Court rendered its decision dated March 23 and March 31, 1998, respectively."
[11]


Judge Wilfredo Ambrosio failed to comply with the directive of the Court. The OCA advised the Court that Judge Ambrosio had resigned from the service upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy although his resignation papers, for purposes of payment of his benefits, were yet being processed.


With respect to Judge Fe Albano Madrid, the OCA observed that the delay, for only a number of days, in the resolution of Civil Case No. 0105, was excusable. The slow movement in the other cases was found to be attributable, not to the Judge, but mainly to the parties. .


The OCA noted that Judge Calimag, in not proffering a single explanation, had tacitly admitted his failure to resolve the cases assigned to him within the reglementary period.


The OCA said that Judge Plan had given no explanation for his delay in disposing the cases in his 
sala
 except to state that it was due to the fault of the parties.


The OCA expressed its sympathy over the plight of Judge Lamorena who suffered a stroke and eventually died while in service. Judge Wilfredo Tumaliwan was forthwith designated as Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 36 
vice
 Judge Lamorena.


In his compliance made on 11 May 1999, Judge Plata averred that Criminal Cases No. 3433, 3434, 2778, 3435, 3071, 2840 and 3570 (instead of 5570), as well as Civil Cases No. 320, 327, 399, 322, 328, 325, 330, 326, and 331, were already decided. The Judge, however, failed to submit copies of his orders and decisions in the criminal cases. The OCA, in its 28 January 2000 memorandum, observed that Judge Plata's orders and decisions were issued only about four (4) months after the judicial audit was conducted. The OCA noted that Civil Cases No. 331, 330, 322 and 327, while all dated 05 June 1998, were released for mailing only on 07 August 1998 or almost two (2) months after they were decided.


The OCA recommended that -




"1. Judge Fe Albano Madrid, RTC, Branch 21, Santiago City, be 
REPRIMANDED
 for the delay in the resolution of Sp. Proc. No. 0105; 


"2. Judge Demetrio Calimag, RTC, Branch 35, Santiago City, be 
FINED

[12]


The OCA did not suggest any administrative sanction against the late Judge Lamorena for "humanitarian reasons."


The Court agrees with the findings, and adopts the recommendations, of the OCA.


In A.M. No. 97-9-283-RTC (Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in Regional Trial Court, Branch 1, Bangued, Abra, 31 May 2000), the Court deemed it inappropriate to impose sanction upon Judge Francisco O. Villarta who died during the pendency of the case against him. For like reasons, no administrative sanction would here be imposed on Judge Efren A. Lamorena.


In the resolution of the Court on 20 July 1999, the parties were required to manifest within ten (10) days from notice if they would be willing to submit the case for resolution on the basis of the reports on record. The parties having failed to comply with its directive, the Court resolved to dispense with their manifestation.


The Court agrees with the OCA that the lapses on the part of the judges can be traced to their failure in the proper observance of the following circulars of the Court; to wit:


(1) Administrative Circular No. 1, dated 28 January 1988, which states: 




"1. 
Effective Docket Control:
 




1.1 All presiding judges of trial courts must, 
upon assumption of office,
 and 
every semester thereafter
 on June 30th and December 31st of every year conduct a 
physical inventory
 of their dockets for the purpose of determining the actual number of cases pending in their salas.


1.2 An 
inventory
 shall be prepared to indicate the 
cases pending trial,
 the 
cases submitted for decision
 and the 
cases that have been archived
. Copy of such inventory shall be submitted to the Supreme Court through the Court Administrator within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Circular and the Inventory Form. 


"1.3 The Presiding Judge and the Clerk of Court shall 
initial
 the Records or Rollos of each case 
to indicate the date of actual inventory.
 The inventory shall include a 
list of cases submitted for decision,
 indicating the 
title and case number 
and the 
date of filing
 of said case. An updated inventory is to be submitted to the Supreme Court every six (6) months thereafter as required in Paragraph 1.1. hereof."
[13]


The circular has been restated by the Court in Administrative Circular No. 10-94 of 29 June 1994.


(2) Circular No. 13, dated 01 July 1987, reiterated in Administrative Circular No. 3-99, dated 15 January 1999, which mandates:




"To insure speedy disposition of cases, the following guidelines must be faithfully observed:




I. The session hours of all Regional Trial Courts, Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts in Cities, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts shall be from 8:30 A.M. to noon and from 2:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M., from Monday to Friday. The hours in the morning shall be devoted to the conduct of trial, while the hours in the afternoon shall be utilized for (1) the conduct of pre-trial conferences; (2) writing of decisions, resolutions, or orders; or (3) the continuation of trial on the merits, whenever rendered necessary, as may be required by the Rules of Court, statutes, or circulars in specified cases.


However, in multi-sala courts in places where there are few practicing lawyers, the schedule may be modified upon request of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines such that one-half of the branches may hold their trial in the morning and the other half in the afternoon. Except those requiring immediate action, all motions should be scheduled for hearing on Friday afternoons, or if Friday is a non-working day, in the afternoon of the next business day. The unauthorized practice of some judges of entertaining motions or setting them for hearing on any other day or time must be immediately stopped. 


"II. Judges must be punctual at all times.


"III. The Clerk of Court, under the direct supervision of the Judge, must comply with Rule 20 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the calendar of cases.


"IV. There should be strict adherence to the policy on avoiding postponements and needless delay.


Sections 2, 3 and 4 of Rule 30, 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure on adjournments and postponements and on the requisites of a motion to postpone trial for absence of evidence or for illness of a party or counsel should be faithfully observed.


Lawyers, as officers of the court, are enjoined to cooperate with judges to ensure swift disposition of cases."
[14]
 


The Court, here again, must stress that while it is not unaware of the heavy caseload of judges nor is it impervious to the plight of judges, it cannot, however, take too lightly Rule 3.05, of Canon 3, of the Code of Judicial Conduct requiring the disposition of the court business and of pending cases or incidents promptly and seasonably.
[15]
 All that a judge really needs to do, in case of great difficulty, would be to request for an extension of time over which the Court has, almost invariably, been sympathetic.
