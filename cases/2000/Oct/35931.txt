[ G.R. No. 116417, October 18, 2000 ]


ALBERTO MAGLASANG, JR., PETITIONER, VS. HON. MERCEDES GOZO DADOLE, PRESIDING JUDGE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, CEBU, BRANCH 28, MANDAUE CITY, AND CONSUELO Q. PABROA, RESPONDENTS.
 D E C I S I O N




PARDO, J.:


The case under consideration is a special civil action for certiorari 
assailing the order of the Regional Trial Court, Cebu, Branch 28, Mandaue 
City
[1]
 approving the commissioner's 
report and ordering the demolition of a structure constructed by Alberto 
Maglasang, Jr., for obstructing the road right of way.


On July 15, 1988, Alberto Maglasang, Jr. filed with the Regional Trial Court, 
Cebu, Mandaue City a petition for the cancellation of the inscription of a 
permanent lien of a right of way on Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-62901 of 
the Office of the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cebu in the name of the 
petitioner, covering a parcel of land situated in Consolacion, Cebu.
[2]
 


On September 28, 1988, Consuelo Q. Pabroa filed an opposition, alleging that 
she owned one of the lots adjoining petitioner's land and that the permanent 
lien of a right of way should not be cancelled because the road on which a 
portion of petitioner's property extends is used by the adjoining landowners as 
the only outlet to the national highway.
[3]
 


After conducting several hearings, the trial court noted that the only access 
to the national highway was through the road right of way located on the 
property of petitioner Alberto Maglasang, Jr. and spouses Jose M. Quiapo and 
Sinforosa Flores. Thus, on October 2, 1989, the trial court denied the petition 
for cancellation of lien.
[4]
 


Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial 
court.
[5]
 Not satisfied, Alberto 
Maglasang, Jr. filed a petition for review with this Court.
[6]
 On August 26, 1991, the Court denied the 
petition.
[7]
 On October 4, 1991, 
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration.
[8]
 However, on October 21, 1991, the Court 
denied the motion for reconsideration.
[9]
 
On November 13, 1991, the decision became final.
[10]


On February 12, 1993, Consuelo Q. Pabroa filed with the trial court a motion 
for execution. On March 2, 1993, she filed another motion for execution with 
prayer for immediate demolition of illegal structures.
[11]
 Respondent Pabroa alleged that while 
awaiting the enforcement of the writ of execution of the order dated October 2, 
1989, petitioner Maglasang built a concrete hollow block fence obstructing the 
two-meter permanent right of way.


The trial court did not rule on the motion for execution, but instead, 
ordered the appointment of a commissioner to conduct an ocular inspection of the 
land in question. By agreement of the parties, the trial court appointed its 
clerk of court, Atty. Bonifacio Go Virtudes, to perform the task. Subsequently, 
Atty. Virtudes submitted a commissioner's report dated March 18, 1993.
[12]
 However, petitioner interposed numerous 
objections to the report.


Consequently, on April 14, 1993, the trial court ordered the appointment of a 
geodetic engineer to conduct a relocation survey of the land, subject of a right 
of way in accordance with the order of the trial court dated October 2, 
1989.
[13]
 


On November 23, 1993, geodetic engineer Cesar V. Tecson submitted a 
commissioner's report.
[14]
 On December 6, 
1993, petitioner filed an opposition to the report.
[15]
 


On January 7, 1994, the trial court ordered geodetic engineer Tecson to 
conduct another relocation survey of the land.


On January 24, 1994, Engineer Tecson submitted his report, adopting the 
findings of the first survey.
[16]
 
Consequently, on February 4, 1994, petitioner filed a reiteration of his 
opposition, alleging that the surveyor was biased and that an approval of the 
commissioner's report would be tantamount to amending the substance of the 
original order which had long become final and irreversible.
[17]
 


On July 22, 1994, the trial court issued the questioned order, approving the 
commissioner's report. The order stated: 






"Finally, since per findings of the commissioner as contained in his reports 
dated November 23, 1993 and January 24, 1994, a structure has been constructed 
by the petitioner which has in a way obstructed the subject road right of way, 
the same must have (sic) to be demolished in order that the road right of way be 
established completely.


"WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, Order is hereby issued:


"1) Approving the commissioner's report dated November 23, 1993 and the 
reiteration on the commissioner's report dated January 24, 1994;


"2) Ordering the petitioner to reimburse oppositor's share in the 
commissioner's fee in the amount of P1,750.00 per court's order dated April 14, 
1992; and,


"3) Ordering the petitioner to demolish the structure which he has 
constructed on the road right of way within ten (10) days from receipt of this 
order; otherwise, after the lapse of ten (10) days without him complying with 
this order, the said structure will be demolished by the Sheriff of this court 
at petitioner's expense.


"SO ORDERED.


"Given in chamber this 22nd day of July, 1994, in the City of Mandaue, 
Philippines.


"(sgd.)MERCEDES GOZO DADOLE "Judge"
[18]
 


Hence, this petition, alleging that the trial court committed a grave abuse 
of discretion when it issued the order dated July 22, 1994, because it modified 
a previous final order dated October 2, 1989.
[19]


On August 12, 1994, the Court required respondents to file a comment and 
enjoined the trial court from enforcing the order dated July 22, 1994, in LRC 
Rec. No. 9462.
[20]
 


On August 22, 1994, private respondent filed her comment, maintaining that 
petitioner constructed a portion of his apartment house and concrete hollow 
block fence on the road which obstructed the right of way. Thus, the illegal 
structures must be demolished. Private respondent further prayed that the 
temporary restraining order against the enforcement of the writ of execution be 
lifted.
[21]
 


On September 19, 1994, the Court resolved to consolidate the present action 
with G. R. No. 101032, where this Court affirmed the decision of the lower 
courts in denying the petition for cancellation of lien of a right of way.
[22]
 


We find that the trial court did not gravely abuse its discretion in issuing 
the order dated July 22, 1994.


An act of a court or tribunal may be considered to have been done in grave 
abuse of discretion when the same was performed in a capricious and whimsical 
exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of 
discretion must be grave as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or 
despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility and must be so patent 
and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to 
perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.
[23]


It is undisputed that an easement of a right of way had been constituted in a 
prior proceeding. The trial court order dated October 2, 1989, established the 
need for a right of way to be maintained on petitioner's property. However, in 
order to maintain the lien of a right of way, the trial court considered the 
possibility that structures may be built to obstruct the right of way.


It was necessary to conduct an ocular inspection to determine if such right 
of way had been rendered ineffective by petitioner's acts. The trial court went 
through great lengths appointing commissioners to conduct surveys of the land to 
determine whether petitioner encroached on the subject right of way. As a result 
of the ocular inspections made on the property, it was revealed that a portion 
of petitioner's property obstructed the right of way.


Thus, the challenged order did not modify the previous order, but actually 
implemented the order of the trial court dated October 2, 1989. The order for 
demolition was, therefore, incidental to the execution of the order dated 
October 2, 1989.


WHEREFORE
, the Court 
DISMISSES
 the 
petition, for lack of merit. The Court sets aside the resolution dated August 
15, 1994 enjoining the trial court from enforcing the order dated July 22, 1994, 
in LRC Rec. No. 9462.


No costs.


SO ORDERED.
