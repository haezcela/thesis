REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES REP. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM, PETITIONER, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND GREEN CITY ESTATE & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.
DECISION




GONZAGA-REYES, J.:


This is a petition for review by certiorari of the Decision
[1]

 of the Court of Appeals dated December 9, 1998 that reversed the Order 
of petitioner, the Department of Agrarian Reform (petitioner DAR), by 
exempting the parcels of land of private respondent Green City Estate 
and Development Corporation (private respondent) from agrarian reform. 
Also assailed in this instant petition is the Resolution dated May 11, 
1998 issued by the same court that denied the Motion for Reconsideration
 of petitioner DAR.
The five parcels of land in issue has a 
combined area of approximately 112.0577 hectares situated at Barangay 
Punta, Municipality of Jala-Jala, Province of Rizal, covered by Transfer
 Certificates of Title Nos. M-45856, M-45857, M-45858, M-45859 and 
M-45860 of the Register of Deeds of Rizal. Private respondent acquired 
the land by purchase on May 26, 1994 from Marcela Borja vda. De Torres. 
The tax declarations classified the properties as agricultural.
On
 June 16, 1994, petitioner DAR issued a Notice of Coverage of the 
subject parcels of land under compulsory acquisition pursuant to Section
 7, Chapter II of R.A. 6657 or the Comprehensive Land Reform Law of 1998
 (CARL).
On July 21, 1994, private respondent filed with the DAR 
Regional Office an application for exemption of the land from agrarian 
reform, pursuant to DAR Administrative Order No. 6, series of 1994
[2]

 and DOJ Opinion No. 44, series of 1990. Administrative Order No. 6 
provides the guidelines for exemption from the Comprehensive Agrarian 
Reform Program (CARP) coverage while DOJ Opinion No. 44, Series of 1990,
 authorizes the DAR to approve conversion of agricultural lands covered 
by RA 6651 to non-agricultural uses effective June 15 1988.
In support of its application for exemption, private respondent submitted the following documents:
Certified photocopies of the titles and tax declarations.
Vicinity and location plans.
Certification of the Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator of the Office of the Mayor of Jala-Jala.
Resolution No. R-36, series of 1981 of the HLURB.
Certification from the National Irrigation Administration.
On
 October 12, 1994, the DAR Regional Director recommended a denial of the
 said petition, on the ground that private respondent "failed to 
substantiate their (sic) allegation that the properties are indeed in 
the municipality's residential and forest conservation zone and that 
portions of the properties are not irrigated nor irrigable".
On 
February 15, 1995, private respondent filed an Amended Petition for 
Exemption/Exclusion from CARP coverage. This time, private respondent 
alleged that the property should be exempted since it is within the 
residential and forest conservation zones of the town plan/zoning 
ordinance of Jala-Jala. The amended petition for exemption showed that a
 portion of about 15 hectares of the land is irrigated riceland which 
private respondent offered to sell to the farmer beneficiaries or to the
 DAR. In support of its amended petition, private respondent submitted 
the following additional documents:
Certification letter from the HLURB that the specific properties are within the residential and forest conservation zone.
Certification
 from the HLURB that the town plan/zoning ordinance of Jala-Jala was 
approved on December 2, 1981 by the Human Settlements Commission.
Undertaking
 that the landowner is ready and willing to pay disturbance compensation
 to the tenants for such amount as may be agreed upon or directed by the
 DAR.
Vicinity plan.
Amended survey plan which indicates the irrigated riceland that is now excluded from the application.
Certification
 of the Jala-Jala Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator to the 
effect that the properties covered are within the residential and forest
 conservation areas pursuant to the zoning ordinance of Jala-Jala.
On
 October 19, 1995, the DAR Secretary issued an Order denying the 
application for exemption of private respondent, on the grounds that the
 land use plan of Jala-Jala, which differs from its land use map, 
intends to develop 73% of Barangay Punta into an agricultural zone; that
 the certification issued by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board 
(HLURB) is not definite and specific; and that the certification issued 
by the National Irrigation Authority (NIA) that the area is not 
irrigated nor programmed for irrigation, is not conclusive on the DAR, 
since big areas in the municipality are recipients of JICA-funded 
Integrated Jala-Jala Rural Development Projects. The motion for 
reconsideration filed by private respondent was likewise denied by the 
DAR Secretary.
Private respondent then appealed to the Court of 
Appeals. During the course of the appeal, said court created a 
commission composed of three (3) members tasked to conduct an ocular 
inspection and survey of the subject parcels of land and to submit a 
report on the result of such inspection and survey. To verify the report
 of the commission, the DAR constituted its own team to inspect and 
report on the property in question. The verification report of the DAR, 
duly filed with the Court of Appeals, objected to the report of the 
commission mainly due to the lack of specific boundaries delineating the
 surveyed areas.
On December 9, 1998, the Court of Appeals issued
 its Decision that reversed the assailed DAR orders, the dispositive 
portion of which reads:
"WHEREFORE, the Orders of the 
respondent Secretary dated October 19, 1995 and November 15, 1995 are 
hereby REVERSED, and judgement is hereby rendered declaring those 
portions of the land of the petitioner which are mountainous and 
residential, as found by the Courts (sic) commissioners, to be exempt 
from the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, subject to their 
delineation. The records of this case are hereby ordered remanded to the
 respondent Secretary for further proceedings in the determination of 
the boundaries of the said areas."
[3]
Hence
 this petition for review wherein petitioner DAR seeks the reversal of 
the foregoing decision on the ground that the honorable Court of Appeals
 erred:
WHEN IT RULED THAT THERE WAS NO DEFINITE 
CLASSIFICATION OF THE PROPERTIES INVOLVED WHEN, PER THE CORRESPONDING 
TAX DECLARATIONS, THEY ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS AGRICULTURAL.
WHEN
 IT RULED THAT THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE LAND AS OF 1980 OR BEFORE AS
 APPEARING IN TABLE 3-3 OF THE ZONING ORDINANCE IS THE PRESENT 
CLASSIFICATION OF THE LANDHOLDINGS INVOLVED; and
WHEN IT
 MADE A RULING ON HOW SUBJECT LANDHOLDING BE CLASSIFIED (WHETHER COVERED
 BY AGRARIAN REFORM FOR BEING AGRICULTURAL LAND OR NOT) AND DISPOSED OF 
SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE LAND IRRESPECTIVE 
OF THE LEGAL ISSUE RAISED ON THEIR LEGAL CLASSIFICATION, A FUNCTION THAT
 IS VESTED IN CONGRESS.
[4]
The petition has no merit.
Republic
 Act No. 6657 otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law 
(CARL) of 1998 covers all public and private agricultural lands. The 
same law defines agricultural as "land devoted to agricultural activity 
as defined in this Act and 
not classified as mineral, forest, residential, commercial or industrial land
".
[5]
Private
 respondent sought exemption from the coverage of CARL on the ground 
that its five parcels of land are not wholly agricultural. The land use 
map of the municipality, certified by the Office of the Municipal 
Planning and Development Coordinator (MPDC) of Jala-Jala and the report 
of the commission constituted by the Court of Appeals established that 
the properties lie mostly within the residential and forest conservation
 zone.
Petitioner DAR maintains that the subject properties have already been classified as agricultural based on the tax declarations.
[6]

 The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) and petitioner DAR are one in
 contending that the classification of lands once determined by law may 
not be varied or altered by the results of a mere ocular or aerial 
inspection.
[7]
We are 
unable to sustain petitioner's contention. There is no law or 
jurisprudence that holds that the land classification embodied in the 
tax declarations is conclusive and final nor would proscribe any further
 inquiry. Furthermore, the tax declarations are clearly not the sole 
basis of the classification of a land. In fact, DAR Administrative Order
 No. 6 lists other documents, aside from tax declarations, that must be 
submitted when applying for exemption from CARP.
[8]
 In 
Halili vs. Court of Appeals
[9]
,
 we sustained the trial court when it ruled that the classification made
 by the Land Regulatory Board of the land in question outweighed the 
classification stated in the tax declaration. The classification of the 
Board in said case was more recent than that of the tax declaration and 
was based on the present condition of the property and the community 
thereat.
[10]
In this 
case, the Court of Appeals was constrained to resort to an ocular 
inspection of said properties through the commission it created 
considering that the opinion of petitioner DAR conflicted with the land 
use map submitted in evidence by private respondent. Respondent court 
also noted that even from the beginning the properties of private 
respondent had no definite delineation and classification.
[11]

 Hence, the survey of the properties through the court appointed 
commissioners was the judicious and equitable solution to finally 
resolve the issue of land classification and delineation.
The OSG
 stresses that to be exempt from CARP under DOJ Opinion No. 44, the land
 must have been classified as industrial/residential before June 15, 
1988. 
[12]
 Based on this 
premise, the OSG points out that no such classification was presented 
except the municipality's alleged land use map in 1980 showing that 
subject parcels of land fall within the municipality's forest 
conservation zone.
[13]
 The OSG
 further argues that assuming that a change in the use of the subject 
properties in 1980 may justify their exemption from CARP under DOJ 
Opinion No. 44, such land use of 1980 was, nevertheless, 
repealed/amended when the HLURB approved the municipality's 
Comprehensive Development Plan for Barangay Punta for the years 1980 to 
2000 in its Resolution No. 33, series of 1981.
[14]

 The plan for Barangay Punta, where the parcels of land in issue are 
located, allegedly envision the development of the barangay into a 
progressive agricultural community with the limited allocation of only 
51 hectares for residential use and none for commercial and forest 
conservation zone use.
[15]
The
 foregoing arguments are untenable. We are in full agreement with 
respondent Court when it rationalized that the land use map is the more 
appropriate document to consider, thus:
"The petitioner 
(herein private respondent) presented a development plan of the 
Municipality of Jala-Jala, which was approved by the Housing and Land 
Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) on December 2, 1981. It also presented 
certifications from the HLURB and the Municipal Planning and Development
 Coordinator of Jala-Jala that the subject properties fall within the 
Residential and Forest Conservation zones of the municipality. Extant on
 the record is a color-coded land use map of Jala-Jala, showing that the
 petitioner's land falls mostly within the Residential and Forest 
Conservation zones. This notwithstanding, the respondent Secretary of 
Agrarian Reform denied the petitioner's application on the ground that 
the town plan of the municipality, particularly Table 4-4 thereof, shows
 that Barangay Punta is intended to remain and to become a progressive 
agricultural community in view of the abundance of fertile agricultural 
areas in the barangay, and that there is a discrepancy between the land 
use map which identifies a huge forest conservation zone and the land 
use plan which has no area classified as forest conservation.
However,
 a closer look at the development plan for the municipality of Jala-Jala
 shows that Table 4-4 does not represent the present classification of 
land in that municipality, but the proposed land use to be achieved. The
 existing land use as of 1980 is shown by Table 3-3, wherein Barangay 
Punta is shown to have a forest area of 35 hectares and open grassland 
(which was formerly forested area) of 56 hectares. The land use map is 
consistent with this."
[16]
Moreover,
 the commissioner's report on the actual condition of the properties 
confirms the fact that the properties are not wholly agricultural. In 
essence, the report of the commission showed that the land of private 
respondent consists of a mountainous area with an average 28 degree 
slope containing 66.5 hectares; a level, unirrigated area of 34 hectares
 of which 5 to 6 hectares are planted to palay; and a residential area 
of 8 hectares.
[17]
 The finding
 that 66.5 hectares of the 112.0577 hectares of land of private 
respondent have an average slope of 28 degrees provides another cogent 
reason to exempt these portions of the properties from the CARL. Section
 10 of the CARL is clear on this point when it provides that "all lands 
with eighteen percent (18%) slope and over, except those already 
developed shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act".
Petitioner
 DAR and the OSG contest the finding of the Court of Appeals that the 
subject parcels of land have a mountainous slope on the ground that this
 conclusion was allegedly arrived at in a manner not in accord with 
established surveying procedures.
[18]

 They also bewail the consideration given by the Court of Appeals to the
 "slope" issue since this matter was allegedly never raised before the 
DAR and the Court of Appeals.
[19]
 Petitioner DAR and the OSG thus claim that laches had already set in.
[20]
As
 pointed out earlier, the crux of the controversy is whether the subject
 parcels of land in issue are exempt from the coverage of the CARL. The 
determination of the classification and physical condition of the lands 
is therefore material in the disposition of this case, for which purpose
 the Court of Appeals constituted the commission to inspect and survey 
said properties. Petitioner DAR did not object to the creation of a team
 of commissioners
[21]
 when it 
very well knew that the survey and ocular inspection would eventually 
involve the determination of the slope of the subject parcels of land. 
It is the protestation of petitioner that comes at a belated hour. The 
team of commissioners appointed by respondent court was composed persons
 who were mutually acceptable to the parties.
[22]

 Thus, in the absence of any irregularity in the survey and inspection 
of the subject properties, and none is alleged, the report of the 
commissioners deserves full faith and credit and we find no reversible 
error in the reliance by the appellate court upon said report.

, the petition is hereby 
DENIED
. The challenged Decision is 
AFFIRMED

 The team of commissioners was originally composed of Atty. Diosdado 
Saavedra, a representative of the Court of Appeals, Geodetic Engineer 
Nicandro A. Martinez and Geodetic Engineer Braulio Darum. Engineer Darum
 withdrew as commissioner at the last minute, hence Atty. Saavedra and 
Engineer Darum composed the team of commissioners who surveyed the 
properties in issue together with Mr. Carlo Claudio, a professional 
photographer who took the aerial and ground pictures of said properties.
