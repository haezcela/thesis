PARDO, J.:


The above cases were consolidated
[1]
 and are thus jointly decided. The first case (G. R. No. 104769) is an appeal via certiorari taken by AFP Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. (AFP MBAI for short) from the decision of the Court of Appeals the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:
"WHEREFORE, the Decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE insofar as it orders appellant AFP Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. to pay plaintiff appellee exemplary damages; and AMENDED by reducing the nominal damages to P10,000.00, and ordering the private defendants to pay the costs instead of treble costs. Furthermore, the Clerk of the Court a quo is hereby instructed to reassess and determine the additional filing fee that should be paid by plaintiff considering the total amount awarded and to require plaintiff-appellee to pay the deficiency, if any.
"In all other respect, the decision is hereby AFFIRMED.
"SO ORDERED."
[2]
The second case (G. R. No. 135016), is an appeal 
via
 certiorari interposed by Solid Homes, Inc. (hereafter Solid Homes) from the decision of the Court of Appeals, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:
"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition for review is hereby DISMISSED. The appealed order of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City is hereby AFFIRMED in toto."
"SO ORDERED."
[3]
The facts are as follows:
Prior to September 7, 1976, Investco, Inc. was the owner of six (6) parcels of raw land, located in Quezon City and Marikina (Metro Manila, now a City), registered under titles in the names of its predecessors-in-interests, Angela Perez-Staley and Antonio Perez, Jr.
On September 7, 1976, Investco, Inc. agreed to sell the six (6) parcels of land to Solid Homes for P10,211,075.00, payable in installments from July 22, 1977 to January 22, 1983. Among other terms, the parties agreed that Solid Homes would pay the amount of P100,000.00 as down payment upon execution of the contract; that Solid Homes would pay P1,942,215.00 as additional down payment on July 22, 1977, October 22, 1977, and January 22, 1978; and that Solid Homes would pay the balance of P8,188.860.00 in ten (10) semi-annual installments for a period of five (5) years, with interest at twelve (12%) percent per annum. The first installment was due on July 22, 1978. Paragraph 2 of the contract stipulates that:
"Should the (Vendee) fail to pay any of the installments on the due date thereof, he shall pay interest on the installment due at the rate of 1% per month for a total period of only two months or pro rata thereof, and should the (Vendee) still fail to pay the installment due including interest after the grace period of two months, the entire balance of the purchase price agreed upon shall become immediately due and demandable, and the (Vendee) shall pay the same within a period of thirty (30) days from the expiration of the grace period, without the need for judicial action on the part of the (Vendor)."
The parties further agreed that Solid Homes would evict the squatters in the property or obtain a waiver from them, that it would cause the original titles to be cancelled and new ones issued in the name of Investco, Inc. and that Investco, Inc. would contribute one-half of the expenses in clearing the property of occupants, in an amount not exceeding P350,000.00. On or about March 28, 1979, the Register of Deeds of Marikina issued in favor of Investco, Inc. Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 36518, 36680, 36681, 36682, 36683 and 36684 covering the Marikina portion of the property. The contract of sale to Solid Homes was not registered with the Registry of Deeds of Marikina nor annotated on the original titles issued in the name of Investco, Inc.
However, after paying the amount of P2,042,215.00 corresponding to the downpayment, and the amount of P4,084,430.00 representing the first four (4) semi-annual installments and a portion of the fifth installment, Solid Homes made no further payment to Investco, Inc. after February 19, 1981. The postdated checks issued by Solid homes to Investco, Inc. intended for the remaining installments were dishonored, leaving a balance of P4,300,282.91 due under the contract in Investco, Inc.'s favor.
On March 13, 1981, Investco, Inc. and its predecessors-in-interests Angela Perez-Staley and Antonio Perez, Jr. filed with the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Pasig, Branch 26 an action for specific performance and damages against Solid Homes, Inc.
[4]
 In the complaint, Investco, Inc. and co-plaintiffs sought to collect from Solid Homes, Inc. the sum of P4,800,282.91 representing the balance on the purchase price due under the contract, reimbursement of P350,000.00 representing Investco, Inc.'s contribution to the expenses for eviction of squatters and the further sum of P99,559.00 for science and transfer taxes, and actual and moral damages, including attorney's fees.
On April 20, 1981, Solid Homes filed with the trial court an answer to Investco, Inc.'s complaint alleging that the purchase price under the contract was "not yet due" and that the former, in fact, exceeded the installment payments due thereon. Solid Homes prayed for dismissal of Investco, Inc.'s complaint, and interposed a counterclaim for the refund of its excess payments, moral damages in the sum of P500,000.00, and attorney's fees of P20,000.00 "or in the sum equivalent to 10% of whatever amount is awarded in favor of defendant."
[5]
On September 20, 1984, Solid Homes filed with the Register of Deeds of Marikina a notice of 
lis pendens
 with reference to Civil Case No. 40615 requesting that the same be annotated on the titles in Investco, Inc.'s name. On the same date, the notice of 
lis pendens
 was recorded as Entry No. 117191 of the primary Entry Book, Volume 14 of the Office of the Register of Deeds of Marikina, Metro Manila.
However, the notice of 
lis pendens
 was not actually annotated on the titles in the name of Investco, Inc.
On February 14, 1985, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of Investco, Inc. ordering solid Homes to pay plaintiffs P4,800,282.91, representing the balance of the purchase price due under the contract, with interest thereon from February 23, 1981 until paid; P99,559.00 representing science and transfer taxes advanced by Investco to Solid Homes and P250,000.00 as attorney's fees and expenses of litigation.
[6]
On May 27, 1985, the trial court ordered the original record transmitted to the appellate court in view of Solid Home's filing of a notice of appeal.
[7]
In the meantime, on April 23, 1984, Investco, Inc. offered to sell the property to AFP Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. for P27,079,767.00, subsequently reduced to P24,000,000.00, payable in installments. Investco, Inc. furnished AFP MBAI with certified true copies of the titles covering the Marikina property.
In June, 1984, AFP MBAI verified the titles with the Register of Deeds of Marikina, Metro Manila and found that copies of the titles that Investco, Inc. gave were genuine and faithful reproductions of the original titles on file with the Register of Deeds. AFP MBAI noted that there were no liens or encumbrances annotated on the titles.
Moreover, AFP MBAI, through its Real Estate Committee, made an ocular inspection of the property sometime in June and July, 1984 "to determine the nature of the property and its (metes) and bounds." During the inspection, AFP MBAI found that the Investco, Inc. property was underdeveloped raw land "which is mostly cogonal, (with) few trees and shrubs x x x and bounded on one side by the Marikina River."
[8]
 AFP MBAI confirmed the presence of squatter shanties numbering about twenty (20) to thirty (30). Except for a foot path used by the squatters, there was no development on the property.
After determining that the Investco property was suitable for the housing project of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and that the titles covering the same were "clean" and "genuine," AFP MBAI agreed to purchase the same from Investco, Inc. for the price of P24,000,000.00, payable in installments for a period of one (1) year.
On October 10, 1984, Investco, Inc. executed a "Deed of Absolute Sale" conveying the property to AFP MBAI for the price of P24,000,000.00, payable in installments until October 10, 1985.
[9]
 Among other terms, Investco, Inc. warranted to AFP MBAI that "it has good and valid title over the properties subject of (the) sale and (that it ) shall hold (AFP MBAI) free from any adverse claim of whatever nature and from liens an encumbrances of third parties."
[10]
In November, 1984, AFP MBAI again verified the records of the Register of Deeds of Marikina, Metro Manila and confirmed "(t)he absence of any 
lis pendens
, adverse claims or any liens or encumbrance (on) the originals of the title(s) x x x." AFP MBAI also inquired from the MalacaÃ±ang Legal Office, the Land Registration Commission, and the Metropolitan Trial Court of Marikina if there were cases and other problems concerning the property, but found no case involving either Investco, Inc. or the property pending with said court and offices.
[11]
 AFP MBAI also obtained a certification from the Clerk of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Marikina that Investco, Inc. "has no pending case before (that) court."
[12]
In April, 1985, AFP MBAI completed its payments of the purchase price.
On April 26, 1985, the Register of Deeds of Marikina issued Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. N-104941, N-104942, N-104943, N-104944, N-104945 and N-104946 in the name of AFP MBAI. The titles issued were "clean" and contained no annotation of any lien, encumbrance, or adverse claim by a third party.
On November 28, 1985, Solid Homes commenced action
[13]
 before the Regional Trial Court, Marikina, against the Register of Deeds, AFP MBAI and Investco, Inc. for "annotation of 
lis pendens
 and damages" with temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. In its verified complaint, Solid Homes prayed that (a) the Register of Deeds be ordered to annotate on the titles registered in the name of Investco, Inc. the notice of 
lis pendens
 dated September 19, 1984 in relation to civil Case No. 40615, and to carry over the same to the titles in the name of AFP MBAI; (b) alternatively, to declare AFP MBAI as a buyer in bad faith, bound by the judgment to be rendered in Civil Case No. 40615; and (c) AFP MBAI and Investco, Inc. be ordered to pay Solid Homes jointly and severally, unspecified amount of actual, moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees of P100,000.00 plus "ten (10%) percent of the total amount to be awarded to plaintiff." Solid Homes also prayed for an order to enjoin provisionally the Register of Deeds from registering any deed affecting the titles in derogation of solid Home's rights under the contract executed between itself and Investco, Inc.
In due time, AFP MBAI and Investco, Inc. filed with the trial court an answer to the complaint. After pre-trial and trial, on April 25, 1990, the trial court rendered decision holding that:
"Accordingly, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:
Ordering defendant Register of Deeds for (sic) Marikina to annotate the Notice of Lis Pendens, dated September 19, 1984 regarding Civil Case No. 40615 on the titles registered in the name of defendant AFP MBAI, that is TCT Nos. 104941,104942, 104943, 104944 and 104945 and 104946.
Declaring defendant AFP MBAI as a buyer in bad faith and accordingly bound by the final judgment in Civil Case No. 40615, RTC, Pasig, now CA-G.R. No. 13400.
Ordering defendant Investco, Inc. to pay plaintiff nominal damages in the amount of P200,000.00 and exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00.
Ordering defendant AFP Mutual Benefit Association, Inc., to pay plaintiff the amount of P50,000.00 as nominal damages and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.
Ordering defendants Investco and AFP MBAI to pay attorney's fees of P50,000.00 jointly and severally.
Dismissing the counterclaim of defendants.
Ordering private defendants to pay treble costs.
On the cross-claim of defendant AFP MBAI against defendant Investco, Inc., ordering the latter to reimburse the former the amount of P11,000.00 paid pursuant to the Deed of Absolute Sale presented for registration, Exhibit "7".
"SO ORDERED."
[14]
Aggrieved thereby, AFP MBAI appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals.
[15]
On November 29, 1992, the Court of Appeals rendered decision the dispositive portion of which is quoted in the opening paragraph of this decision.
On December 24, 1991, AFP MBAI filed with the Court of Appeals a motion for reconsideration of the decision, which Solid Homes opposed. On March 17, 1991, the Court of Appeals denied the motion.
[16]
Hence, this petition.
[17]
The issue raised is whether Solid Homes is entitled to the annotation of its notice of 
lis pendens
 on the titles of Investco, Inc. and AFP Mutual Benefit Association, Inc., in relation to Civil Case No. 40615 of the Regional Trial Court, Pasig and thereby be bound by the final judgment therein.
Basically, Solid Home's complaint was one for "annotation of lis pendens and other matters with prayer for restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction" against Investco, Inc. AFP MBAI and the Register of Deeds of Marikina, to cause the annotation of 
lis pendens
 in the titles of Investco, Inc. and AFP MBAI. Actually, therefore, the suit is to compel the Register of Deeds of Marikina to annotate the notice of 
lis pendens
 on the titles of AFP MBAI with a claim for damages against Investco, Inc. and AFP MBAI for depriving Solid Homes of its rights to the property as provided under the contract to buy and sell. In its verified complaint, Solid Homes alleged that "the act of defendant Register of Deeds in not causing the annotation of the 
lis pendens
 on the titles then registered in the name of defendant Investco, Inc. and in issuing titles in the name of defendant AFP Mutual Benefit Association, Inc., without carrying over the proper annotation of 
lis pendens
 are contrary to law".
[18]
 On the basis of this allegation, it prayed for an order directing the Register of Deeds of Marikina "to cause the annotation" of the notice of 
lis pendens
 on the old and new titles.
Obviously, the Register of Deed's obligation to annotate the notice of 
lis pendens
 is one that arises from law.
[19]
 Hence, the action is actually one for mandamus to compel the performance of a clear legal duty.
[20]
 There is no such action as one for "annotation of 
lis pendens
," as Solid Homes sought in its complaint.
"
Lis pendens
 is a Latin term which literally means a pending suit or a pending litigation while a 
notice of lis pendens
 is an announcement to the whole world that a particular real property is in litigation, serving as a warning that one who acquires an interest over the said property does so at his own risk, or that he gambles on the result of the litigation over the said property. It is but a signal to the intending buyer or mortgagee to take care or beware and to investigate the prospect or non-prospect of the litigation succeeding before he forks down his money."
[21]
A notice of 
lis pendens
 is not and can not be sought as a principal action for relief. "The notice is but an incident to an action, an extra-judicial one to be sure. It does not affect the merits thereof. It is intended merely to constructively advise, or warn, all people who deal with the property that they so deal with it at their own risk, and whatever rights they may acquire in the property in any voluntary transaction are subject to the results of the action, and may well be inferior and subordinate to those which may be finally determined and laid down therein."
[22]
 The notice of 
lis pendens
--that real property is involved in an action--is ordinarily recorded without the intervention of the court where the action is pending.
[23]
 As a settled rule, notice of 
lis pendens
 may be annotated only where there is an action or proceeding in court which affects title to or possession of real property.
[24]
Under Presidential Decree No. 1529, known as the "Property Registration Decree of 1978", the Register of Deeds may deny registration of the notice of 
lis pendens
, which denial may be appealed by the applicant en consulta (Section 10, paragraph 2) to the Commissioner of Land Registration.
[25]
 Section 117 of P.D. No. 1529 provides:
"When the Register of Deeds is in doubt with regard to the proper step to be taken or memorandum to be made in pursuance of any deed, mortgage or other instrument present to him for registration, or where any party in interest does not agree with the action taken by the Register of Deeds with reference to any such instrument, the question shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Land Registration by the Register of Deeds, or by the party in interest thru the Register of Deeds.
"Where the instrument is denied registration, the Registration of Deeds shall notify the interested party in writing, setting forth the defects of the instrument or legal grounds relied upon, and advising him that if he is not agreeable to such ruling, he may, without withdrawing the documents from the Registry, elevate the matter by consulta within five days from receipt of notice of the denial of registration to the Commissioner of Land Registration.
The Register of Deeds shall make a memorandum of the pending consulta on the certificate of title which shall be cancelled motu proprio by the Register of Deeds after final resolution or decision thereof, or before resolution, if withdrawn by petitioner.
"The Commissioner of Land Registration considering the consulta and the records certified to him after notice to the parties and hearing, shall enter an order prescribing the step to be taken or memorandum to be made. His resolution of ruling in consultas shall be conclusive and binding upon all Register of Deeds, provided, that the party in interest who disagrees with the final resolution, ruling or order of the Commissioner relative to consultas may appeal to the Court of Appeals within the period and in the manner provided in Republic Act No. 5434."
Here, the Register of Deeds of Marikina denied the annotation of the notice of 
lis pendens
 on the ground that the complaint in Civil Case No. 40615 was for collection of a sum of money and did not involve the titles to or possession of the subject property.
[26]
 If Solid Homes did not agree with the denial of the Register of Deeds, it could appeal the same 
en consulta
 to the Commissioner of Land Registration.
[27]
 The resolution of the Commissioner may then be appealed to the Court of Appeals, which has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the same, "within the period and in the manner provided in Republic Act No. 5434."
[28]
In its questioned decision, the Court of Appeals held that the action filed by Investco, Inc. against Solid Homes "is not exclusively for payment of the unpaid installments on the purchase price of the subject properties and damages, but also one for rescission of the contract to sell and to buy the subject properties executed by defendant Investco, Inc. in favor of (Solid Homes) which necessarily involves delivery of possession and ownership of the same."
[29]
We do not agree. This ruling conflicts with the final decision of the Supreme Court on the case.
[30]
 What is more, in determining the nature of plaintiff's (Investco, Inc.) action in Civil Case No. 40615 and defendant Solid Home's counterclaim thereto, the Court of Appeals went beyond the allegations in the complaint and ventured into speculation and conjecture. There is nothing in Investco's complaint in Civil Case No. 40615 that even remotely suggests that Investco, Inc. has rescinded the contract, or that it sought the rescission of the sale as an alternative remedy. Specific performance and rescission are alternative remedies which a party may not avail himself of at the same time.
[31]
The nature of an action is determined by the allegations of the complaint.
[32]
Investco's complaint was an action for collection of sums of money, damages and attorney's fees
[33]
 to recover from Solid Homes unpaid installments on the purchase price of the subject property. To emphasize, 
the case was an action for collection of unpaid installments on the purchase price subject real property.
 In such case, the annotation of a notice of lis pendens on the titles of the property was not proper as the action was in personam.
[34]
Consequently, the doctrine of lis pendens is inapplicable to this case. The Register of Deeds of Marikina correctly denied the annotation of the notice of 
lis pendens
 on the titles of Investco, Inc. and the AFP MBAI.
[35]
Even on the basis of Solid Home's counterclaim, which is disregarded in determining the nature of the action, notice of 
lis pendens
 is improper as the counterclaim was also for sums of money--alleged excess payment and for damages--not one affecting title to or possession of real property. Such counterclaim did not convert the nature of the action into a real action involving title to or possession of subject property.
The rule that "all persons dealing with property covered by Torrens Certificate of title are not required to go beyond what appears on the face of the title"
[36]
 applies herein with full vigor. In the absence of anything to excite suspicion, the buyer is not obligated to look beyond the certificate to investigate the titles of the seller appearing on the face of the certificate.
[37]
"Good faith is always presumed, and upon him who alleges bad faith on the part of a possessor rests the burden of proof."
[38]
 Here, Solid Homes alleged that Investco, Inc. and AFP MBAI "confederated with each other in entering into the aforementioned sale in order to deprive herein plaintiff (Solid Homes) of its rights over subject properties under the Contract to Sell and to Buy..."
[39]
 However, Solid Homes adduced no evidence to prove such allegation of bad faith.
The conclusion is inevitable that contrary to the holding of the Court of Appeals, AFP MBAI was a purchaser in good faith and for value, and, consequently, acquired valid and indefeasible titles to the Investco, Inc. property.
Resultantly, we find the appeal 
via
 certiorari of solid Homes
[40]
 without merit. Its objective was to compel AFP MBAI to execute a deed of transfer of the titles to parcels of land originally covered by the agreement to buy and sell between Solid Homes, Inc. and Investco, Inc. and for Solid Homes to pay AFP MBAI, in substitution of Investco, Inc. the amount of P4,800,282.91 with interest thereon at one per cent per month from March 22, 1982, until paid. Thus, if Solid Homes would succeed in its scheme in the case, it would unjustly enrich itself enormously, acquiring subject property now worth billions of pesos
[41]
 for the measly sum of P4,800,282.91 with interest at one per cent a month from March 22, 1982, which it was unable to pay Investco, Inc. in the first place.
Solid Home's claim is predicated on the assumption that AFP MBAI is a transferee 
pendente lite
 of Investco, Inc. of the subject parcels of land and bound by the result of the suit.
[42]
 Such claim is not factually or legally correct. In the absence of a valid notice of 
lis pendens
 annotated in the titles, AFP MBAI is a buyer in good faith and for value, and thus, acquired clean and valid titles to the property in question.
WHEREFORE
, the Court:
(1)      In G. R. No. 104769,
