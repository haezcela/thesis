VITUG, J.:


Following a judicial audit and physical inventory of cases in various courts of Quezon province, the Office of the Court Administrator reported its following findings; to wit:
I. REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF GUMACA, QUEZON, BRANCH 61
Branch 61, a special criminal court designated to try heinous crimes cases, was presided by Judge Proceso K. De Gala until his compulsory retirement on 02 July 1998. The judicial audit team reported that the court building, although old, was still adequate and that the Presiding Judge also used part of it as his dwelling place in violation of Administrative Circular No. 3-92 of 31 August 1992. While docket books were maintained, the entries thereon, however, were not properly updated. Most of the informations filed with the court lacked the required certification of preliminary investigation, the records forwarded by the Investigating Fiscal did not include the records on the preliminary investigation proceedings, as well as other documents (such as affidavits) pertinent thereto, and numerous criminal cases had no certificates of arraignment attached to the records.
The summary of the cases in Branch 61 indicated the following data:

III. MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURTS OF CALAUAG AND TAGKAWAYAN, QUEZON
The Municipal Trial Court ("MTC") of Calauag, Quezon, was presided by Judge Bienvenido P. Go who also was the Acting Judge of MTC, Tagkawayan, until he was compulsorily retired on 03 May 1998. Court sessions were regularly held until just before the retirement of Judge Go. In Calauag, orders and minutes of the proceedings were not promptly typewritten by the stenographer, making it difficult for the team to assess the status of the cases. The required certificates of arraignment were not attached to the records, there was no systematic filing and recording of cases, and the dockets were not updated.
Hereunder is a summary of the cases before the MTC of Calauag, Quezon; thus:

[1]
In his comment, dated 12 October 1999, Judge Proceso K. de Gala explained that the following cases were decided before his retirement on 02 July 1998:
 Criminal Case No. 4849-G (People vs. Demetrio Yu) - decided on 27 May 1998, promulgated on 09 June 1998;
Civil Case No. 1923-G (Refazo, et al., vs. Diestro Lines, Ltd.) - decided on 26 June 1998;
Civil Case No. 2204-G (Argamosa-Curaming vs. De Luna, et al.) - decided on 24 June 1998;
Civil Case No. 1980-G (Fuerte vs. PeÃ±aojas) - decided on 29 June 1998;
Civil Case No. 2088-G (Lamon Bay Ice Plant vs. DBP) - decided on 14 May 1998
The judge attributes whatever imperfections he might have committed to human errors and honest omissions brought about by a number of factors; consider, he avers, that -
"1. Branch 61 had been designated special court for violation of Forestry laws [P.D. 705];
"2. Said court was also designated on October 21, 1996 as special court for heinous crimes cases which requires immediate attention due to shorter period (90 days) given by the law to terminate the cases;
"3. As of date of designation in 1996, Branch 61 has a caseload of 323 pending cases, 59 of which are heinous crimes, which increased to 96 cases in 1997 and from January to June 1998, 99 cases (evidenced by monthly reports for December 1996; December 1997 and June 1998, Annexes 'A, B, C,' of the Comment, rollo, pp. 43-48).
"4. Trial days consists only of 5 days a week or 20 to 22 days a month. He conducts trial as follows Tuesdays and Thursdays for heinous crime cases; Wednesday for other criminal cases involving detention prisoners; Monday afternoons and Friday mornings for civil cases. Thus, he had only Monday mornings and Friday afternoons for resolving cases and penning decisions."
[2]
Judge De Gala adds that this critical situation of having more than 300 pending cases, including heinous crimes, with only 20 to 22 days trial every month, has largely contributed to the resetting of cases for a longer period than that required under the Rules. The litigants and counsels themselves would request for longer periods to reset their cases, almost invariably due to the following reasons:
"(a) Litigants in the Bondoc Peninsula area and the Alabat Island Group needed sufficient time to raise money for their next hearing;
"(b) Difficulty of travel from this court to the Bondoc Peninsula during rainy season and stormy weather due to impassable roads and those from the Alabat Island Group due to strong winds and risky sea travel;
"(c) Insufficient mail service in these areas which is only once a day and regularly made only during fair weather."
[3]
The judge denied having used the court premises for his dwelling place, the courthouse, he said, being located on top of a mountain and isolated from the town proper. Its construction was done during the term of then Senator Lorenzo Tanada, Sr., and a private quarter for Judges (including a chamber and comfort room) were also constructed. Not only he but also the court personnel would use the facilities. An adjoining room was the court chamber where visitors could be received and pre-trial conferences held. For six months prior to his retirement, he used this private quarter as an extension of his work place but never as a dwelling place. He usually had to stay late in his office to finish drafting decisions, resolving motion and other pending incidents before his retirement. He did not bring records of cases to his house in Candelaria, Quezon, for security reasons. Through his efforts, the courthouse was later improved with the financial assistance of the Governor and the Congressman of the province.
Branch Clerk of Court Arnel B. Caparros, for his part, informed the Court that Judge De Gala decided all pending cases submitted for decision before his retirement; to wit:
a) Criminal Cases Nos. 4326-G and 4343-G
Promulgated on 25 June 1998;
b) Criminal Case No. 4716-G
Promulgated on 24 June 1998
c) Criminal Case No. 4483-G
Promulgated on 25 June 1998
d) Criminal Cases Nos. 4308-G and 4318-G
Promulgated on 25 June 1998
e) Criminal Case No. 4754-G
Promulgated on 11 June 1998;
f) Criminal Case No. 5548-G
Promulgated on 16 June 1998;
g) Criminal Cases No. 5636-G; 5637-G; 5638-G and 5639-G
Promulgated on 17 June 1998
Caparros attached the Certificates of Arraignment to the records of cases. He enumerated additional cases decided by Judge De Gala before his retirement; 
viz
:
a) Criminal Case No. 5453-G (People vs. Soliven, et al.)
Decided on 18 June 1998
Promulgated on 23 June 1998;
b) Criminal Case No. 5866-G (People vs. Chua)
Decided on 23 June 1998;
c) Criminal Case No. 5867-G (People vs. Chua)
Decided on 23 June 1998;
d) Criminal Case No. 4741-G (People vs. Maloloyon)
Decided on 19 May 1998;
e) Civil Case No. 2137-G (Suarez Agro Industries vs. DBP)
Decided on 23 June 1998;
f) Civil Case No. 2260-G (Marguard vs. Marguard)
Decided on 26 June 1998;
He informed the Court of the status of the following cases, thus:
"a) Civil Case No. 1807 (Abella vs. Borabon) - Motion to Enforce Order was resolved on June 1, 1998;
"b) Civil Case No. 2248 (Sps. Marasigan vs. Caltex Phils.) -Motion For Reconsideration resolved on June 29
, 
1998;
"c) Criminal Case No. 5359 (PP. vs. Fermin)
 -
Motion to Dismiss resolved on June 26, 1998;
"d) Election Case No. 128-G -Terminated on May 28, 1998"
[4]
Branch Clerk of Court Caparros explained that the errors in his 1998 monthly report of cases "submitted for decision" was due to oversight and volume of work. He said that Branch 61, a special court for heinous crimes cases, had invariably resolved on time cases submitted for decision.

On the irregular schedule of hearings and the long resetting of cases, Judge Garduque explained that he would hear cases everyday with a minimum of ten (10) cases per day as so shown in his calendar of cases. The delays and resetting of cases, if any, were invariably due to:
"1) The absence of either counsel or parties;
"2) There is only one Public Attorney assigned in the area who handles all the cases in the 5 Municipal Trial Courts aside from his cases with this court (Branch 63) which often results to conflicts of schedule of hearings.
"3) The dearth of practicing lawyers in Calauag where in this municipality there is not a single practicing lawyer while in the nearby town of Lopez, there are only two but who are busy practicing in other provinces and cities. Parties have to request for a considerable time to look for lawyer who still have to come from Lucena City or Gumaca; and
"4) The numerous brownouts occurring in the area thus more often hearings are held with the use of candle lights."
[11]
Judge Garduque also submitted to the Court a list of additional cases he decided prior to his retirement, thus:

After evaluating the records of cases in relation to the Audit report, the Office of the Court Administrator, through Deputy Court Administrator Reynaldo L. Suarez, made the following report and recommendations:
"RTC, BRANCH 61, GUMACA, QUEZON
"1. Judge Praceso K. De Gala (retired on July 2, 1998) is found guilty of dereliction of duties and gross inefficiency for his failure to decide 5 cases (1 criminal and 4 civil) submitted to him for decision within the ninety (90) day period. While he may have decided the same prior to his retirement, evidently the decisions were rendered after the lapse of the period fixed by law as shown below:
 
 
"a) 
 
Criminal Case No. 4849-G, People vs. Yu -

"e)
 
 
Civil Case 2088-G, Lamon Bay Ice Plant vs. DBP
 
 
 
 
Submitted: June 24, 1997
 
 
 
 
Decided: May 14, 1998
 
 
"Judge De Gala attributed the delay to the fact that Branch 61 has been assigned as a special court to try cases for violations of Forestry Laws and heinous crime cases. In addition, the heavy caseload compels him to conduct trial everyday leaving only Monday mornings and Friday afternoons for resolving motions and penning decisions.
"This is not a justifiable excuse. Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct admonishes all judges to dispose of the court's business promptly and decide cases within the period fixed by law. The failure to render a decision within the 90 day period from the date of submission of cases constitutes
 
serious misconduct in derogation of the speedy administration of justice (Castillo vs. Cortes, 234 SCRA 398 [1994]; Alfonso-Cortes vs. Maglalang, 227 SCRA 482 [1993]).
"The additional assignment of Judge De Gala should not have deterred him from disposing off the several cases pending before him. If ever he cannot decide the same within the time frame all he had to do was to request from this Court a reasonable extension of time to resolve the cases (Cruz vs. Basa, 218 SCRA 557 [1993]); Report of Justice Felipe B. Kalalo, 282 SCRA 61 [1997]).
"With regard to other cases submitted for decision, records show that Judge De Gala were able to decide the same within the ninety day period to wit: Criminal Cases Nos. 5443-G, 5866-G, 5867-G, 4741-G and Civil Cases Nos. 2137-G, 2260-G and has resolved the matters/incidents pending in the following cases: Civil Case Nos. 1807-G, 2248-G, Criminal Case No. 5359-G and Election Case No. 128-G within the same period.
"Likewise, the cases found by the audit team to be scheduled for promulgation were promulgated on scheduled dates and within the ninety (90) day period. The same is true with those criminal and civil case required to be archived for one reason or another, the same were archived by Judge De Gala pursuant to Administrative Circular 7-A-92.
"2. As regard the resetting of cases for a longer period than required under Rule 30, Section 2, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Judge De Gala explains that while trials are held everyday, the days of the month are insufficient considering the case load of more than 300 and the heinous crimes cases which needs preferential attention. This is confirmed by the report of the Audit Team that cases are regularly calendared and sessions were held daily from Monday to Friday. However, it is also noted that Judge De Gala acceded to the request of some litigants particularly in the Bondoc Peninsula Area and the Alabat Island Group for a longer resetting of cases. A look at the geographical map shows that the Bondoc Peninsula is a mountainous area and the Alabat Island is separated from the mainland of Quezon. These two areas are far too distant to the court and there is even possibility of difficulty of travel from those places to Gumaca court. However, while this maybe true, not all cases in Branch 61 originated from these areas. Still most of the cases pending in said court come from Gumaca and nearby municipalities.
"While Judge De Gala acceded to the request of the parties for a longer period of resetting and has given preferential attention to the trial of heinous crimes cases, still he has no authority to adjourn a case for a period of 6 months or more. Section 2, Rule 30, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure states that:
"'A court may adjourn a trial from day to day, and to any stated time, as the expeditious and convenient transaction of business may require, but it shall have no power to adjourn a trial for a longer period than one month for each adjournment nor more than three months in all, 
except when authorized in writing by the Court Administrator, Supreme Court
.
'Rule 119, Section 2 relative to criminal cases provides that trial once commence shall continue from day to day as far as practicable until terminated, but for good cause, 
it may be postponed but for a reasonable period of time
.
"Records show that Judge Gala has not secured the required authority from the Court Administrator.
"3. Judge De Gala is found to have violated Administrative Circular 3-92 which prohibits the use of Halls of Justice for residential or commercial purposes. He admits that there is a room cum private quarter inside the courthouse, and that he has used this private quarter as his rest room and a room to take respite whenever he becomes tired from his arduous work. He also admits that 6 months prior to his retirement, he always stay late in his office every night, among others, to decide cases and resolve pending matters.
"As observed by the evaluator who together with Justice Romulo S. Quimbo led the audit, the court is housed in an old building. It has a living quarter, two comfort rooms (one is used by the judge and the other by the personnel), a kitchen and a receiving room. It has a television set inside the courtroom. The Judge at the time of the audit is wearing only T-shirt, pants and slippers. Later in the night, evaluator Atty. Manuel Guevara, Jr., Mr. Rolando Navarro and Mr. Noel Buhion went back to the courthouse upon the invitation of Judge De Gala and it is where he admitted that his residence is in Candelaria, Quezon which is several kilometers away from the courthouse.
"On the basis of this observation in conjunction with the explanation of Judge De Gala that 6 months prior to his retirement he stays late every night in his office to finish the undecided cases, there is reason to believe that Judge De Gala at least on the 6 months period (which includes the period of audit) had been using part of the courthouse as his residential quarters albeit temporarily. For one, his residence is far away from the court; Second, the scarcity of transportation during night time considering that the court is isolated from the town proper; and Third, lack of material time to decide the cases submitted before him prior to his retirement.
"It is not, however, relevant whether the use of court premises is strictly temporary because what is involved here is the delirious effect of the court's reputation to the public. His behavior betrays a lack of judicial decorum which diminishes the image of the court of justice (see related cases Kelly Austria vs. Judge Singuat Guerra, A.M. No. RTJ-89-327, October 17, 1991 resolution; Bautista vs. Costelo, Jr., 254 SCRA 157 [1996]).
"Clearly, Judge De Gala violated Administrative Circular No. 3-92 dated August 31, 1992 which prohibits all judges and court personnel the use of the court premises not directly related to the functions and operations of the courts of justice devoting it to other use such as his residential quarters.

RTC, BRANCH 63, CALAUAG, QUEZON

Likewise, the motion to dismiss pending in Civil Case No. 1019 which was still within the period to resolve when audited was acted upon by Judge Garduque beyond the ninety day period.
"With respect to the cases reported to be without court action or with no further settings for a considerable length of time, records shows that Judge Garduque had already issued orders and these cases are still pending trial, some of these cases, however, had already been decided or dismissed, namely:

Dismissed on July 17, 1998;
 
 
"Required to explain in the Court resolution of September 15, 1998, Judge Garduque in his Comment did not proffer any explanation on the delay and inaction of these cases.
"Evidently from the foregoing findings, Judge Garduque's non action and delay in deciding cases greatly impeded the speedy administration of justice. He failed to observe Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct which mandates a judge to dispose of the court's business promptly and decide within the required period. Under Section 15 (1) and (2), Article VIII of the Constitution, the lower court should decide or resolve cases submitted for decision within 3 months from the filing of the last required pleading, brief or memorandum. This requirement of the fundamental law is designed to prevent delay in the administration of justice for obviously justice delayed is justice denied, and delay in the disposition of cases erodes the faith and confidence of our people in the judiciary, lower its standards and brings it into disrepute. Failure to decide even a case within the required period is not excusable and constitutes gross inefficiency which is a ground for administrative sanction against a defaulting judge (A.M. No. 96-3-88-RTC, September 30, 1996 resolution, Report on the Audit and Inventory of cases in the RTC, Branch 55, Alaminos Pangasinan; A.M. No. 97-9-282-RTC, Report on the Judicial Audit conducted in RTC, Branch 27, Lapu-Lapu City, April 22, 1998 resolution).
"2. With regard to the irregular schedule of hearings and long resetting of cases found by the audit team, we find the explanation of Judge Garduque unsatisfactory. He attributes this to the dearth of practicing lawyers in the area. He claims that there is only one public Attorney to handle cases in the 5 Municipal Trial Courts and the RTC, Calauag which sometimes result to conflict of hearing schedules and that in the municipality of Calauag, there is no practicing lawyer while in the town of Lopez, there are only two. Judge Garduque is not left without recourse. He should have coordinated or made an arrangement with the 5 MCTC Judges to avoid the conflicts and at the same time to avoid waste of time or day of trial by reason of the absence of counsel.
"While the calendar for October 14, 1998 shows that Judge Garduque has scheduled hearings (arraignment, pre-trial, trial) for 32 cases, this is not absolute evidence that he conducts hearings daily. Greater weight should be given to the report of the Audit Team that on the months of January, February, March, and April of 1998, as evidenced in the court calendar Judge Garduque hold sessions only on certain days in violation of existing circulars of this Court enjoining judges to conduct day to day trial.
"Trial judges must be punctual at all times and should strictly adhere to the policy on avoiding postponements and needless delay. Judges should strictly observe session hours which shall be from 8:30 A.M. to 12:00 noon and from 2:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. from Monday to Friday (as required by paragraph 5 of the Interim Rules pursuant to Section 16 of B.P. 129; and Circular No. 13 dated July 1, 1987). It was recently reiterated in Adm. Circular No. 3-99 issued by the Hon. Chief Justice on January 15, 1999 to ensure the speedy disposition of cases. Said Circular also provides that the hours in the morning shall be devoted to the conduct of trial, while the hours in the afternoon shall be utilized for (1) the conduct of pre-trial conferences; (2) writing of decisions, resolutions or orders; or (3) the continuation of trial on the merits, if necessary (Adm. Circular No. 3-99 dated January 15, 1999).
"Moreover, Judges should actively manage the trial of their cases by rational calendaring of cases and avoid unnecessary postponements of cases. A rational policy on postponements should be observed so that the court are not at the mercy of the lawyers and the parties without at the same time imposing abusive, unnecessary and oppressive denial of meritorious motions for postponements.
"However, under Section 3, Rule 22, the Court has no authority to adjourn a trial for a longer period than one month for each adjournment, nor more than three months in all unless authorized in writing by the Chief Justice (now by the Court Administrator, Rule 30, Section 2, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure) and that in criminal cases, Rule 119, Section 2 provides that the trial shall be conducted day to day as far as practicable until terminated (Adm. Circular No. 13 dated July 1, 1987). And lawyers as officers of the court are enjoined to cooperate with judges to ensure swift disposition of cases (Adm. Circular No. 3-99 dated January 15, 1999).
"Lastly, it is noted that though the aforementioned cases submitted for decision before Judges De Gala and Garduque were beyond the ninety (90) day period, the fact remains that Judges De Gala and Garduque were able to decide all these cases before they retire, hence, can be considered to mitigate their liability on the penalty to be imposed by this Court.
"With respect to the Branch Clerk of Court of RTC, Gumaca, we find unsatisfactory the explanation of Atty. Arnel B. Caparros that it was due to oversight and volume of work that some of the cases audited to be submitted for decision were not reflected in the monthly report of April, 1998.
"On the other hand, Branch Clerk of Court Chona E. Pulgar-Navarro of RTC, Calauag, as required by the resolution of September 15, 1998 submitted to this Court the Semestral Docket Inventory Report for the 1st and 2nd semesters of year 1997, but has not offered any explanation as to her previous non-submission of the same. As Branch Clerk of Court, she ought to know that the submission of Semestral Docket Inventory Report is on the last week of February and last week of August of each year (Adm. Circular No. 10-94, dated June 29, 1994). Her failure to submit said report on time constitutes neglect of duty.
"As held in one case the Branch Clerk of Court's failure to prepare proper or correct monthly reports of cases constitutes a serious breach of duty. One of the basic responsibilities of a Branch Clerk of Court is the preparation of the monthly report of cases to be submitted to the Supreme Court (Manual for Clerks of Courts, p. 131): Branch Clerk of Court Caparros cannot claim volume of work much less oversight because he is required to keep a list of cases submitted for decision and in preparing a monthly report he is obliged to reflect in said report all cases pending for decision on said month. He was negligent in the performance of his duty.
"Attys. Caparros and Navarro as Branch Clerks of Courts must realize that their administrative functions are just as vital to the prompt and proper administration of justice. They are charged with the efficient recording, filing and management of court records, besides having supervision over court personnel. They play a key role in the complement of the court and cannot be permitted to slacken on their jobs under one pretext or another. They must be assiduous in performing their official duties and in supervising and managing court dockets and records (Lloveras vs. Sanchez, 229 SCRA 302 [1994], OCA vs. Banalan, 231 SCRA 408 [1994], RTC Makati Movement Against Graft and Corruption vs. Dumlao, 247 SCRA 108, [1995]; Nidua vs. Lazaro, 174 SCRA 581 [1989].
MTC CALAUAG AND MTC, TAGKAWAYAN, QUEZON
"Lastly, with respect to cases audited in the MTC, Calauag and MTC, Tagkawayan, both in the province of Quezon, Bienvenido P. Go who presided in both courts as the regular judge and acting judge, respectively, retired on May 3, 1998 prior to the audit. Nevertheless, in the resolution of September 15, 1998, the Court directed Judge Manuel Salumbides as Acting Judge Designate of the MTC's of Calauag and Tagkawayan to decide, resolve and act on those cases pending in the aforesaid courts mentioned in the report.
RECOMMENDATION
"
WHEREFORE
, it is respectfully recommended that:
 
 
"1.
 
 
Judge Proceso K. De Gala, RTC, Branch 61, Gumaca, Quezon be found guilty of dereliction of duties and gross inefficiency for his failure to decide Criminal Cases Nos. 4849-G and Civil Cases Nos. 1923, 1980, 2204 and 2088 within the ninety (90) day period; for violation of Section 2, Rule 30, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure; and for violation of Adm. Circular No. 3-92 and accordingly be meted a FINE of P20,000.00, the amount to be deducted from the P50,000.00 ordered withheld from his retirement benefits per resolution dated September 15, 1998 and the balance of P30,000.00 to be delivered to him by the Court;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"2. 
 
Judge Rodolfo V. Garduque, RTC, Branch 63, Calauag, Quezon, be found guilty of dereliction of duties and gross inefficiency for his failure to decide Criminal Cases Nos. 2802-C, 2580-C, 2207-C, 1638-C, 1956-C and SP-150, SP-2798 and Civil Case No. 1117; and for his failure to resolve within the period required on matters/incidents pending in Criminal Cases Nos. 2234-C, 2609-C and Civil Case Nos. C-1012, SP-962 and for his inaction for a considerable length of time those cases mentioned in the report, and for his violation of existing circulars and the rules of court relative to punctuality and strict observance of session hours and to adjournments and postponement of cases and accordingly a FINE of P20,000.00 be imposed, the amount to be deducted from the P50,000.00 ordered withheld from his retirements benefits per resolution of September 15, 1998 and the balance of P30,000.00 to be delivered to him by the Court;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"3.
 
 
Branch Clerks of Courts Arnel B. Caparros of Branch 61 be found guilty of breach of duty and negligence for the untruthful and erroneous April, 1998 monthly report submitted to this Court and Chona E. Pulgar-Navarro for dereliction of duty in failing to submit the required semestral docket inventory report and both be SEVERELY CENSURED with warning that a repetition of similar infraction in the future will be dealt with more severely by this Court;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
NOTE: For failure to update entries in the docket books, both were ADMONISHED in the resolution of September 15, 1998.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"4.
 
 
Judge Designate Manuel Salumbides of MTC, Calauag and MTC, Tagkawayan be directed to INFORM this Court, thru the Office of the Court Administrator, witin ten (10) days from notice the status of the cases mentioned in the resolution of September 15, 1998."
[14]
 
 
In the resolution, dated 08 June 1999, of the Court, Judge Proceso K. De Gala, Judge Rodolfo V. Garduque and Branch Clerks of Court Arnel B. Caparros and Chona E. Pulgar-Navarro were required to manifest if they were submitting the case for resolution on the basis of the documents on record. In the same resolution, Judge-Designate Manuel Salumbides of MTC, Calauag and MTC, Tagkawayan, was directed to inform the Court of the status of the cases mentioned in the Court's resolution of 15 September 1998. His compliance was noted in the resolution, dated 21 September 1999, of the Court.
All, except for Judge Garduque, have manifested their submission of the case for resolution. In view of the failure of Judge Garduque to comply with the resolution of 08 June 1999, the Court is constrained to dispense with his manifestation.
The Court agrees with the report and accepts the recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator.
The Court is not unaware of the heavy caseload of judges. It is for this reason precisely why the Court has been sympathetic to requests for extensions of time within which to decide cases and resolve matters and incidents related thereto. All that a judge really needs to do is to ask, a request which is almost invariably granted.
[15]
 While the Court is not impervious to the plight of judges, it cannot, however, take too lightly Rule 3.05, of Canon 3, of the Code of Judicial Conduct requiring the disposition of court business promptly and of pending cases or incidents within the period fixed therefor.
With respect to the adjournment of civil cases, attention might be invited to Section 2, Rule 30, of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure to the effect that a court "shall have no power to adjourn a trial for a longer period than one month for each adjournment, nor more than three months in all, except when authorized in writing by the Court Administrator, Supreme Court." In the adjournment of criminal cases, Section 2, Rule 119, of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure requires continuous trial and any postponement may be made but only "for a reasonable period of time."
In order to avoid undue delays in the disposition of cases, as well as in the interest of good order, the observance of office hours are to be strictly observed. The Office of the Court Administrator has aptly remarked:
"Trial judges must be punctual at all times and should strictly adhere to the policy on avoiding postponements and needless delays. Judges should strictly observe session hours which shall be from 8:30 A.M. to 12:00 noon and from 2:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. from Monday to Friday (as required by paragraph 5 of the Interim Rules pursuant to Section 16 of B.P. 129; and Circular No. 13 dated July 1, 1987). It was recently reiterated in Adm. Circular No. 3-99 issued by the Hon. Chief Justice on January 15, 1999 to ensure the speedy disposition of cases. Said Circular also provides that the hours in the morning shall be devoted to the conduct of trial, while the hours in the afternoon shall be utilized for (1) the conduct of pre-trial conferences; (2) writing of decisions, resolutions or orders; or (3) the continuation of trial on the merits, if necessary (Adm. Circular No. 3-99 dated January 15, 1999)."
[16]
The Court accepts the explanation of Judge De Gala as regards the report that he has used the court premises for his residence. Considering his workload, it is understandable that he must have been constrained to stay late at night particularly prior to his retirement in order to finish his undecided cases.
Clerks of Court Caparros and Pulgar-Navarro should be reminded that they are ranking officers in our judicial system.
[17]
 It is their basic responsibilities to conduct docket inventory and to ensure that the records of each case are constantly accounted for.
[18]
 The volume of work cannot be an excuse for their being remiss in the performance of these functions, and it may not be underscored enough that the office of a clerk of court involves the performance of delicate administrative duties essential to the prompt and proper administration of justice.
[19]
