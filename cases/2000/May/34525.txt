ROBERTO CONQUILLA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND EDUARDO A. ALARILLA, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




BELLOSILLO, J.:


ROBERTO CONQUILLA assails in this special civil action for certiorari the En Banc Resolution of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) dated 7 September 1999 which affirmed the Resolution of its First Division dated 21 May 1998 dismissing his 
Petition for Cancellation of Certificate of Candidacy and Disqualification
 against private respondent EDUARDO A. ALARILLA
[1]
 for lack of merit.
On 27 March 1998 ALARILLA filed his 
Certificate of Candidacy
 with the Municipal Election Officer of Meycauayan, Bulacan, without however indicating the elective position which he was aspiring for. Thus in the blank space provided therefor appeared merely -
CERTIFICATE OF CANDIDACY
I hereby announce my candidacy for the office of 
Meycauayan, Bulacan
, Republic of the Philippines, in the May 11, 1998 elections x x x x
However, attached thereto and filed with his 
Certificate of Candidacy
 was ALARILLAâs 
Certificate of Nomination and Acceptance
 to wit -
CERTIFICATE OF NOMINATION AND ACCEPTANCE
I , JOSE DE VENECIA, JR., by virtue of the powers and authority vested in me by the Constitution and By-Laws of the Lakas National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines (LAKAS NUCD-UMDP) as its Secretary-General, hereby nominate:
EDUARDO A. ALARILLA
as the Partyâs official candidate in the May 11, 1998 elections for the position of MUNICIPAL MAYOR of the 
Municipality of Meycauayan in the Fourth District of Bulacan.
WITNESS MY HAND this 
18th day of March 1998
 in Makati City, Metro Manila.

I hereby accept the foregoing nomination and pledge to work for the total victory of the Party in my area of responsibility.

EDUARDO A. ALARILLA
On 14 April 1998 CONQUILLA filed with the COMELEC a 
Petition for Cancellation of Certificate of Candidacy and Disqualification
, docketed as SPA No. 98-132, praying that private respondent ALARILLA's 
Certificate of Candidacy
 be expunged and cancelled on the ground that it was null and void for failing to specify the elective position he was running for and, consequently, he be disqualified to run for any position n Meycauayan, Bulacan.
During the pendency of SPA No. 98-132 the Board of Canvassers proclaimed ALARILLA as the Mayor-elect of Meycauayan, Bulacan. As a consequence, CONQUILLA filed an "
Urgent Motion to Annul the Proclamation and/or to Suspend the Effects of Proclamation
" of ALARILLA contending that any decision in SPA No. 98-132 would be pre-empted unless his proclamation was nullified. The records do not show that the motion was properly acted upon.
On 21 May 1998 the First Division of COMELEC dismissed SPA No. 98-132 for lack of merit. It ruled that ALARILLA's failure to specify the public office he was seeking in his 
Certificate of Candidacy
 was not a fatal defect because the required information was supplied in the 
Certificate of Nomination and Acceptance
 attached to his 
Certificate of Candidacy
. In addition, the First Division ruled that ALARILLA was able to correct his omission by filing an 
Amended Certificate of Candidacy
 on 21 April 1998 clearly indicating therein that he was running for the position of Municipal Mayor, Meycauayan, Bulacan.
On 1 June 1998 CONQUILLA filed an "
Appeal with Urgent Motion for Annulment and/or Suspension of Proclamation with Prayer for Issuance of a Restraining Order.
" He also prayed that the Resolution of the First Division be set aside. The "
Appeal with Urgent Motion for Annulment . . .
 " was treated as a motion for reconsideration under Rule 19 of the Comelec 
Rules of Procedure
 and accordingly certified to the COMELEC En Banc pursuant to Sec. 5 thereof.
[2]
On 7 September 1998 the COMELEC 
En Banc
 denied the motion for reconsideration for being 
pro-forma
 and for late filing.
[3]
 The COMELEC ruled that under Sec. 9, Rule 19, of the 
Comelec Rules of Procedure
[4]
 CONQUILLA had only until 31 March 1998, i.e., five (5) days within which to move for reconsideration counted from the time he allegedly received the questioned Resolution of the First Division on 26 March 1998. Hence, the "
Appeal with Urgent Motion for Annulment and/or Suspension of Proclamation with Prayer for Issuance of a Restraining Order
" was late having been filed on 1 June 1998.
CONQUILLA contends that public respondent COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion: (a) in affirming in toto the Resolution of the First Division dismissing SPA No. 98-132 for lack of merit; (b) in ruling that the 
Certificate of Nomination and Acceptance
 attached to private respondentâs Certificate of Candidacy could be used as basis in determining the elective position private respondent was seeking; and, (c) in not resolving the motion to suspend private respondentâs proclamation as Mayor-elect of Meycauayan, Bulacan. Additionally, CONQUILLA contends that COMELEC erred in dismissing his appeal for late filing.
We agree with CONQUILLA that his motion for reconsideration was not filed late on 1 June 1998 considering that 31 May 1998 was a Sunday, hence, he had until the next working day, which was 1 June 1998, within which to ask for reconsideration.
[5]
 However, we cannot agree that ALARILLA's failure to specify the public office he was seeking in his 
Certificate of Candidacy
 was a fatal defect, for several reasons.
First.
 As correctly observed by the First Division of COMELEC and affirmed by COMELEC 
En Banc
, the information omitted in the Certificate of Candidacy was supplied in the 
Certificate of Nomination and Acceptance
 attached thereto specifying that ALARILLA was nominated as the Lakas NUCD-UMDPâs official candidate for the position of 
Municipal Mayor
 of Meycauayan, Bulacan, and that such nomination had been accepted by ALARILLA. As the COMELEC itself has clarified, certificates of nomination and acceptance are procedurally required to be filed with, and form an integral part of, the certificates of candidacy of official candidates of political parties.
Second.
 ALARILLA timely rectified the deficiency in his original 
Certificate of Candidacy
 by filing an 
Amended Certificate
 on 21 April 1998 specifically stating that he was running for the position of 
Municipal Mayor
 of Meycauayan, Bulacan, in the 11 May 1998 elections. In 
Alialy v. Commission on Elections
[6]
 where petitioners sought the reversal of a COMELEC resolution denying due course to a certificate of candidacy on the ground that it was not subscribed under oath by the secretary of the Nacionalista Party as required by Sec. 35 of the Revised Election Code, this Court ruling on the effectiveness of the amended certificate of candidacy filed to correct the defect declared that the filing of an amended certificate even after the deadline but before the election was substantial compliance with the law which cured the defect. The Court further said -
x     x     x     when the Election Law does not provide that a departure from a prescribed 
form
 will be fatal and such departure has been due to an 
honest mistake or misinterpretation of the Election Law
 on the part of him who was obligated to observe it, and that such departure has not been used as a means for fraudulent practices x x x the law will be held directory and such departure will be considered a harmless irregularity (
Gardiner v. Romulo
, 26 Phil. 521, cited in the 
De Guzman v. Bd. of Canvassers of La Union and Lucero
, 48 Phil. 211, 214-215). For inconsequential deviations which cannot affect the result of the election, or deviations from provisions intended primarily to secure timely and orderly conduct of elections, a directory construction is generally applied (
III Sutherland Stat. Const.
, 3rd Ed. Sec. 5820, pp.113-114 - cases cited therein). The same ruling is given on acts not calculated to affect the integrity of the elections (
Hunt v. Mann,
 136 Miss. 590).
Third.
 The purpose in requiring a certificate of candidacy (which is to enable the voters to know before the elections the candidates among whom they are to make a choice) was deemed satisfied not only by the 
Amended Certificate of Candidacy
 filed before the elections but also by the 
Certified List of Candidates
 issued by the Office of the Election Officer, Meycauayan, Bulacan, indubitably listing therein EDUARDO A. ALARILLA as candidate for the position of "
mayor
" of said municipality.
Finally, it cannot be denied that 
ALARILLA was elected Mayor of Meycauayan, Bulacan,
 in the 11 May 1998 elections. If substantial compliance with the Election Law should give way to a mere technicality, the will of the electorate, as far as ALARILLA is concerned, would be frustrated.
