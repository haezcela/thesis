THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. TEOFISTO COTAS Y LIMPIAHOY, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




MENDOZA, J.:


This case is here on automatic appeal of the decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 31, San Pedro, Laguna, sentencing accused-appellant to death.
The Information against accused-appellant alleged:
[2]
That on or about March 24, 1997 in the Municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court accused Teofisto Cotas y Limpiahoy while conveniently armed with a bladed weapon (Tres Cantos) with intent to kill did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab one Rossman Asuncion y Kho with the said weapon inflicting upon him stab wounds on the different parts of his body which directly caused his death to the damage and prejudice of his surviving heirs.
Contrary to Law, and that the crime was committed with the attendance of aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, treachery and abuse of superior strength.
Upon accused-appellantâs plea of not guilty, the trial of the case commenced.
The prosecution evidence established the following: Rossman Asuncion, 22, and Geraldine Tungala, lived in common-law relationship. They have two daughters, Lady Angela, aged 4, and Carla May, aged 2. At the time material to this case, the family lived in Pitimini Village, Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna.
At around 12 noon of March 24, 1997, Asuncion and his two daughters were taking a nap on the floor in the sala of their house when, without any warning, accused-appellant entered the house and stabbed Asuncion several times with a file popularly known in the localities as "tres cantos." At the time he was stabbed, Asuncion was lying on his stomach with his face down. Lady Angela, who was lying beside her father, was awakened by the commotion and saw accused-appellant stabbing her father. She jumped up and went outside to look for her mother. Asuncionâs wife, Tungala, who was in a neighborâs house about two armsâ length away from their own, heard her husband exclaim three times "
Kuya Jovy, hindi po ako lalaban
" (â
Kuya
â
[3]
 Jovy, I wonât fight you). Tungala rushed to their house. On the way, she met her daughter who told her "
Mama, si Papa sinaksak ni Kuya Jovy
" (Mama, Papa was stabbed by 
Kuya
 Jovy).
[4]
Tungala saw accused-appellant coming down the front steps of their house, wiping his knife with his shirt. She was frightened, and so she ran away. Accused-appellant, on the other hand, jumped over the fence and fled.
[5]
Asuncion was taken to the hospital but he was pronounced dead on arrival. At the request of his wife, Dr. Bienvenido MuÃ±oz of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) performed an autopsy on the cadaver of Asuncion and later issued the following post-mortem report:
[6]

Dr. MuÃ±oz testified that of the seven stab wounds and six incised wounds sustained by the victim, the three stab wounds on his back and the one near his left armpit were fatal. These wounds penetrated his lungs, causing massive hemorrhage in the area. He added that the wounds at the back of the victim were inflicted from behind, while the one near the left armpit was inflicted while the victim was raising his left arm, probably in an attempt to parry the blows of the assailant. In addition, Dr. MuÃ±oz stated that the wounds found on the victimâs arms were defensive in character, 
i.e.
, these were inflicted when the victim was attempting to protect himself from attack.
[7]
With regard to the fatal weapon used, Dr. MuÃ±oz testified that the victimâs stab wounds were caused by a file,
[8]
 specifically of the type more popularly known in the local dialect as 
tres cantos
[9]
 or any other similar weapon. He ruled out the possibility that an ice pick was used by the assailant because the stab wounds exhibited contused edges and blunt extremities. An ice pick does not leave any serration on the edges of the woundsâ entry point. As for the incised wounds, Dr. MuÃ±oz stated that these could have been caused also by a file or any other sharp pointed object such as a knife, pin or ice pick.
[10]
To testify on matters relating to the arrest of accused-appellant, the prosecution presented PO2 Rizaldy Amion. Amion testified that at around one in the afternoon of March 24, 1997, while he was on duty at the Philippine National Police (PNP) station in San Pedro, Laguna, he received a call from Sofronio Lazarte, an acquaintance, who told him that accused-appellant had stabbed someone and was in Lazarteâs house. After instructing the stationâs radio operator to contact the mobile patrol unit, Amion proceeded to Lazarteâs house. When he got there, Lazarte told him that accused-appellant was in the toilet. Amion twice called out and identified himself to accused-appellant who then came out naked. Amion informed him that he was under arrest for the stabbing of Asuncion and read to him his Miranda rights in Tagalog. Accused-appellant was then taken to the San Pedro police station where he was booked for the fatal stabbing of Rossman Asuncion.
[11]
The defense then presented its case. Accused-appellant did not deny stabbing Asuncion. He claimed, however, that he acted in self-defense. He said that at around 12 noon of March 24, 1997, while he was inside his house in Cuyab Street, San Pedro, Laguna, he saw Asuncion in their yard, sitting inside the chicken coop, putting a chicken inside a sack. According to him, he allegedly shouted at Asuncion "
Hoy, anong ginagawa mo diyan?
" (Hey, what are you doing there?). Apparently resenting the question, Asuncion allegedly pulled out a knife from the right side of his waist and attacked accused-appellant. The latter, who was then about two meters from Asuncion, allegedly was hit on both sides of his forehead and on his right arm. However, he was allegedly able to wrest the knife from Asuncion and with it, he stabbed Asuncion. Accused-appellant then went to the house of his cousin Sofronio Lazarte to turn himself in.
[12]
On cross-examination, accused-appellant said he could not recall the number and location of the stab wounds he had inflicted on Asuncion nor the type and length of the weapon he used in stabbing the victim. With regard to the wounds he sustained, he stated that he treated himself with Betadine because the jailguard at the police station denied his request to see a doctor.
[13]
On November 18, 1997, the trial court rendered judgment the dispositive portion of which provides:
[14]
WHEREFORE, this Court renders judgment sentencing accused Teofisto Cotas to suffer the penalty of death, to pay the heirs of Rossman Asuncion the following sums: P50,000,00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, P20,000.00 representing expenses incurred during the funeral, burial and wake of the deceased and P1,840,000,00 as lost earnings/income and to pay the costs.
In this appeal, accused-appellant alleges that:
[15]
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT UPHOLDING SELF-DEFENSE AS A GROUND FOR [THE] ACQUITTAL OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS AT ALL GUILTY, THE TRIAL COURT NEVERTHELESS ERRED IN CONVICTING HIM FOR MURDER INSTEAD OF ONLY HOMICIDE.
First.
 Accused-appellant reiterates his contention below that he acted in self-defense when he stabbed and killed Rossman Asuncion. He thus admits committing the acts constituting the crime for which he was charged,
[16]
 and the burden of proof is on him to establish, by clear and convincing proof, the following requisites of self-defense: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.
[17]
 Of these requisites, unlawful aggression, i.e., the sudden and unprovoked attack on the person defending himself, is indispensable.
[18]
 Absent such element, no claim of self-defense can be successfully interposed.
[19]
In this case, the prosecutionâs principal witness, Lady Angela, despite the fact that she was then barely four years old, described very clearly how accused-appellant stabbed her father. She said:

This account by a child of tender years is highly credible, especially because it is corroborated by the result of the autopsy examination showing that the victim sustained three fatal stab wounds at the back, in addition to other injuries which, according to Dr. MuÃ±oz, the victim sustained while trying to defend himself from accused-appellantâs blows. The nature, character, location and extent of these wounds belie accused-appellantâs claim that the victim attacked him with a knife and it was in self-defense that after wresting the knife from the victim, accused-appellant used it against the former.
Indeed, the victimâs common-law wife said her husband thrice said to accused-appellant, "
Kuya Jovy, hindi po ako lalaban
" (Kuya Jovy, I wonât fight you). This statement, which constitutes res gestae,
[21]
 belies that Asuncion was the aggressor.
Even assuming that Asuncion was the aggressor, it is clear that at the time he was killed, the danger to accused-appellant had already ceased. It is a settled rule that when unlawful aggression ceases, the defender has no longer any right to kill or wound the former aggressor,
[22]
 otherwise, retaliation and not self-defense is committed.
[23]
 In this case, accused-appellant stabbed Asuncion seven times and inflicted on him several incised wounds.
Accused-appellant says it is allegedly incredible for the child to have gone out of their house unscathed as "no criminal would allow someone who . . . witnessed his dastardly act to live another day . . . ."
[24]
The contention has no merit. The fact that the child was able to come out of their house unharmed does not mean that she lied on the stand. The trial court, who observed her demeanor in court, stated:
[25]
. . . . prosecution witness [Lady Angela] at her very tender age who fears God and knows that lying is bad would not have testified as she did if it were not true that her father Rossman was lying down and sleeping on the floor when accused stabbed him with what appears to be an ice pick. In this instant case, there is no basis to doubt the testimony of Kitkat which was given in a candid, categorical and consistent manner. There is likewise no reason for her to testify falsely against accused whom she calls her "kuya." Thus, her positive assertion that accused stabbed her sleeping father, . . . deserves full faith [and] belief .
That Lady Angela was able to slip out of their house may be explained by the fact that at the time she did so, accused-appellant was attacking the victim. In fact, when her mother arrived in their house, accused-appellant was just coming down the stairs of their house.
Second.
 Accused-appellant contends, in the alternative, that even if his act of killing Asuncion is not justified, he should only be held liable for homicide and not for murder as the prosecution allegedly failed to prove the qualifying circumstance of treachery and evident premeditation.
[26]
We agree there was no evident premeditation as the prosecution failed to show: (1) the time when accused-appellant decided to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the accused had clung to his determination; and (3) a sufficient lapse of time between such determination and its execution to allow him to reflect upon the consequence of his act.
[27]
However, there is evidence of treachery. Lady Angela testified that when accused-appellant entered their house, her father, younger sister and herself were all asleep on the floor in the sala of their house. Her father was lying on his stomach,
[28]
 with his face down, and it was in that position that he was killed by accused-appellant. It was only after he had been stabbed that Asuncion was awakened. It is settled that if the victim, when killed, was sleeping
[29]
 or had just awakened,
[30]
 the killing is with treachery because in such cases, the victim was not in a position to put up any form of defense.
[31]
Although not raised in this appeal, the killing of Asuncion was attended by the generic aggravating circumstance of dwelling
[32]
 as the victim was killed in his own house. However, this circumstance is offset by the generic mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender of accused-appellant. The evidence shows that immediately after the stabbing, he went to the house of his cousin, Lazarte, who called the PNP station in San Pedro to inform them of the presence of accused-appellant in his (Lazarteâs) house. When PO2 Amion arrived at Lazarteâs house, he found accused-appellant who gave himself up without any resistance. The following requisites of voluntary surrender were present: (1) the offender has not been arrested; (2) he surrendered himself to a person in authority or to an agent of a person in authority; and (3) his surrender was voluntary.
[33]
 That accused-appellant first went to his cousin and not directly to the police is of no moment because the latter merely acted as an intermediary and such is recognized by law.
[34]
Under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, murder is punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 to death. Pursuant to Art. 63(2) thereof, the penalty of death should be imposed if, in addition to the requisite qualifying circumstances enumerated in Art. 248, the killing is attended by one or more generic aggravating circumstance. In this case, while it is true that the murder of Asuncion was also attended by the generic aggravating circumstance of dwelling, the same, as already stated, is offset by the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. Consequently, the lower penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 should be imposed.
Third.
 Modifications should be made with regard to the damages awarded by the lower court. The awards of P50,000.00 moral damages and P50,000.00 indemnity to the heirs of the victim were proper.
[35]
 However the actual damages of P20,000.00 should be reduced to P12,000.00 as this is the amount shown in the receipt (Exh. C) presented by the prosecution to evidence the expenses incurred by the victimâs family in relation to Asuncionâs death.
In addition, the P1,840,000.00 unearned income awarded by the trial court should be deleted. Awards for the loss of earning capacity partake of the nature of damages
[36]
 and must thus be proved not only by credible and satisfactory evidence but also by unbiased proof.
[37]
In this case, the evidence is insufficient to support the lower courtâs award. The only evidence in the record is the testimony of Tungala that her common-law husband used to earn a monthy salary of P5,000.00 from Cosmos Bottling Corporation, although at the time he died, he was not gainfully employed. No other evidence was presented to corroborate her testimony. In 
People v. Villanueva
,
[38]
 which is analogous to this case, the only evidence presented to support the claim for unearned income was the testimony of the victimâs widow that her late husband earned about P2,500.00 a week from fish vending. This Court ruled that such testimony was insufficient because it was self-serving. Hence, it ordered the award made by the lower court deleted. This ruling was followed in 
People v. Sanchez
[39]
 and 
People v. EreÃ±o.
[40]
 
WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 31, San Pedro, Laguna, is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that accused-appellantâs sentence is reduced to reclusion perpetua and the amount of actual damages is reduced to P12,000.00, while the award for unearned income is deleted.
