PANGANIBAN, J.:


After agreeing to a contract stipulating that a real or immovable 
property be considered as personal or movable, a party is estopped from 
subsequently claiming otherwise.  Hence, such property is a proper 
subject of a writ of replevin obtained by the other contracting party.


The Case




Before us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the January 6, 1999 Decision
[1]
  of the Court of Appeals (CA)
[2]
  in CA-GR SP No. 47332 and its February 26, 1999 Resolution
[3]
  denying reconsideration.  The decretal portion of the CA Decision reads as follows:



 âWHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Order dated February
 18, 1998 and Resolution dated March 31, 1998 in Civil Case No. 
Q-98-33500 are hereby AFFIRMED.  The writ of preliminary injunction 
issued on June 15, 1998 is hereby LIFTED.â
[4]





    In its February 18, 1998 Order,
[5]
  the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City (Branch 218)
[6]
  issued a Writ of Seizure.
[7]
  The March 18, 1998 Resolution
[8]

 denied petitionersâ Motion for Special Protective Order, praying that 
the deputy sheriff be enjoined âfrom seizing immobilized or other real 
properties in (petitionersâ) factory in Cainta, Rizal and to return to 
their original place whatever immobilized machineries or equipments he 
may have removed.â
[9]







The Facts




The undisputed facts are summarized by the Court of Appeals as follows:
[10]




 âOn February 13, 1998, respondent PCI Leasing and Finance, Inc. 
(âPCI Leasingâ for short) filed with the RTC-QC a complaint for [a] sum 
of money (Annex âEâ), with an application for a writ of replevin 
docketed as Civil Case No. Q-98-33500. 


 âOn March 6, 1998, upon an ex-parte application of PCI Leasing, 
respondent judge issued a writ of replevin (Annex âBâ) directing its 
sheriff to seize and deliver the machineries and equipment to PCI 
Leasing after 5 days and upon the payment of the necessary expenses. 


 âOn March 24, 1998, in implementation of said writ, the sheriff 
proceeded to petitionerâs factory, seized one machinery with [the] word 
that he [would] return for the other machineries. 


 âOn March 25, 1998, petitioners filed a motion for special 
protective order (Annex âCâ), invoking the power of the court to control
 the conduct of its officers and amend and control its processes, 
praying for a directive for the sheriff to defer enforcement of the writ
 of replevin. 


 âThis motion was opposed by PCI Leasing (Annex âFâ), on the ground
 that the properties [were] still personal and therefore still subject 
to seizure and a writ of replevin. 


 âIn their Reply, petitioners asserted that the properties sought 
to be seized [were] immovable as defined in Article 415 of the Civil 
Code, the partiesâ agreement to the contrary notwithstanding.  They 
argued that to give effect to the agreement would be prejudicial to 
innocent third parties.  They further stated that PCI Leasing [was] 
estopped from treating these machineries as personal because the 
contracts in which the alleged agreement [were] embodied [were] totally 
sham and farcical. 


 âOn April 6, 1998, the sheriff again sought to enforce the writ of
 seizure and take possession of the remaining properties.  He was able 
to take two more, but was prevented by the workers from taking the rest.
 


 âOn April 7, 1998, they went to [the CA] via an original action for certiorari.â
  





Ruling of the Court of Appeals




Citing the Agreement of the parties, the appellate court held that the 
subject machines were personal property, and that they had only been 
leased, not owned, by petitioners.  It also ruled that the âwords of the
 contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the true intention of the 
contracting parties.â  Observing that Petitioner Goquiolay was an 
experienced businessman who was ânot unfamiliar with the ways of the 
trade,â  it ruled that he âshould have realized the import of the 
document he signed.â  The CA further held:



 âFurthermore, to accord merit to this petition would be to preempt
 the trial court in ruling upon the case below, since the merits of the 
whole matter are laid down before us via a petition whose sole purpose 
is to inquire upon the existence of a grave abuse of discretion on the 
part of the [RTC] in issuing the assailed Order and Resolution.  The 
issues raised herein are proper subjects of a full-blown trial, 
necessitating presentation of evidence by both parties.  The contract is
 being enforced by one, and [its] validity is attacked by the other â a 
matter x x x which respondent court is in the best position to 
determine.â
  



    Hence, this Petition.
[11]







The Issues




In their Memorandum, petitioners submit the following issues for our consideration:



 âA. Whether or not the machineries purchased and imported by SERGâS became real property by virtue of immobilization. 


 B. Whether or not the contract between the parties is a loan or a lease.â
[12]







In the main, the Court will resolve whether the said machines are 
personal, not immovable, property which may be a proper subject of a 
writ of replevin.  As a preliminary matter, the Court will also address 
briefly the procedural points raised by respondent.

 The Courtâs Ruling 



The Petition is not meritorious.


Preliminary Matter:Procedural Questions




Respondent contends that the Petition failed to indicate expressly 
whether it was being filed under Rule 45 or Rule 65 of the Rules of 
Court.  It further alleges that the Petition erroneously impleaded  
Judge Hilario Laqui as respondent.


There is no question that the present recourse is under Rule 45.  This 
conclusion finds support in the very title of the Petition, which is 
âPetition for Review on Certiorari.â
[13]



While Judge Laqui should not have been impleaded as a respondent,
[14]

  substantial justice requires that such lapse by itself should not 
warrant the dismissal of the present Petition.  In this light, the Court
 deems it proper to remove, motu proprio, the name of Judge Laqui from 
the caption of the present case.


Main Issue: Nature of the Subject Machinery




Petitioners contend that the subject machines used in their factory were
 not proper subjects of the Writ issued by the RTC, because they were in
 fact real property.  Serious policy considerations, they argue, 
militate against a contrary characterization.


Rule 60 of the Rules of Court provides that writs of replevin are issued for the recovery of personal property only.
[15]
  Section 3 thereof reads:



 âSEC. 3.
 Order. 
- Upon the filing of such affidavit and 
approval of the bond, the court shall issue an order and the 
corresponding writ of replevin describing the personal property alleged 
to be wrongfully detained and requiring the sheriff forthwith to take 
such property into his custody.â
  





On the other hand, Article 415 of the Civil Code enumerates immovable or real property as follows:



 âART. 415.  The following are immovable property: 





x x x....................................x x x....................................x x x


(5) Machinery, receptacles, instruments or implements intended by the 
owner of the tenement for an industry or works which may be carried on 
in a building or on a piece of land, and which tend directly to meet the
 needs of the said industry or works;


x x x....................................x x x....................................x x xâ


In the present case, the machines that were the subjects of the Writ of 
Seizure were placed by petitioners in the factory built on their own 
land.  Indisputably, they were essential and principal elements of their
 chocolate-making industry.  Hence, although each of them was movable or
 personal property on its own, all of them have become âimmobilized by 
destination because they are essential and principal elements in the 
industry.â
[16]
  In that sense,
 petitioners are correct in arguing that the said machines are real, not
 personal, property pursuant to Article 415 (5) of the Civil Code.
[17]



Be that as it may, we disagree with the submission of the petitioners 
that the said machines are not proper subjects of the Writ of Seizure. 


The Court has held that contracting parties may validly stipulate that a real property be considered  as personal.
[18]

  After agreeing to such stipulation, they are consequently estopped 
from claiming otherwise.  Under the principle of estoppel, a party to a 
contract is ordinarily precluded from denying the truth of any material 
fact found therein.  


Hence, in Tumalad v. Vicencio,
[19]

  the Court upheld the intention of the parties to treat a house as a 
personal property  because it had been made the subject of a chattel 
mortgage.  The Court ruled:



 âx x x.  Although there is no specific statement referring to the 
subject house as personal property, yet by ceding, selling or 
transferring a property by way of chattel mortgage defendants-appellants
 could only have meant to convey the house as chattel, or at least, 
intended to treat the same as such, so that they should not now be 
allowed to make an inconsistent stand by claiming otherwise.â
  





Applying Tumalad, the Court in Makati Leasing and Finance Corp. v. Wearever Textile Mills
[20]

  also held that the machinery used in a factory and essential to the 
industry, as in the present case, was a proper subject of a writ of 
replevin because it was treated as personal property in a contract.  
Pertinent portions of the Courtâs ruling are reproduced hereunder:



 âx x x.  If a house of strong materials, like what was involved in
 the above Tumalad case, may be considered as personal property for 
purposes of executing a chattel mortgage thereon as long as the parties 
to the contract so agree and no innocent third party will be prejudiced 
thereby, there is absolutely no reason why a machinery, which is movable
 in its nature and becomes immobilized only by destination or purpose, 
may not be likewise treated as such.  This is really because one who has
 so agreed is estopped from denying the existence of the chattel 
mortgage.â
  





In the present case, the Lease Agreement clearly provides that the 
machines in question are to be considered  as personal property.  
Specifically, Section 12.1 of the Agreement reads as follows:
[21]




 â12.1  The PROPERTY is, and shall at all times be and remain, 
personal property notwithstanding that the PROPERTY or any part thereof 
may now be, or hereafter become, in any manner affixed or attached to or
 embedded in, or permanently resting upon, real property or any building
 thereon, or attached in any manner to what is permanent.â
  



  Clearly then, petitioners are estopped from denying the 
characterization of the subject machines as personal property.   Under 
the circumstances, they are proper subjects of the Writ of Seizure.
  


 It should be stressed, however, that our holding -- that the 
machines should be deemed personal property pursuant to the Lease 
Agreement â is good only insofar as the contracting parties are 
concerned.
[22]
  Hence, while 
the parties are bound by the Agreement, third persons acting in good 
faith are not affected by its stipulation characterizing the subject 
machinery as personal.
[23]
  In any event, there is no showing that any specific third party would be adversely affected.
  





Validity of the Lease Agreement




    In their Memorandum, petitioners contend that the Agreement is a loan and not a lease.
[24]

 Submitting documents supposedly showing that they own the subject 
machines, petitioners also argue in their Petition that the Agreement 
suffers from âintrinsic ambiguity which places in serious doubt the 
intention of the parties and the validity of the lease agreement 
itself.â
[25]
 In their Reply to respondentâs Comment, they further allege that the Agreement is invalid.
[26]





    These arguments are unconvincing.  The validity and the nature of 
the contract are the lis mota of the civil action pending before the 
RTC.  A resolution of these questions, therefore, is effectively a 
resolution of the merits of the case.  Hence, they should be threshed 
out in the trial, not in the proceedings involving the issuance of the 
Writ of Seizure.
  


 Indeed, in  La TondeÃ±a Distillers v. CA,
[27]

 the Court explained that the policy under Rule 60 was that questions 
involving title to the subject property â questions which petitioners 
are now raising --   should be determined in the trial.  In that case, 
the Court noted that the remedy of defendants under Rule 60 was either 
to post a counter-bond or to question the sufficiency of the plaintiffâs
 bond.  They were not allowed, however, to invoke the title to the 
subject property.  The Court ruled: 




 âIn other words, the law does not allow the defendant to file a 
motion to dissolve or discharge the writ of seizure (or delivery) on 
ground of insufficiency of the complaint or of the grounds relied upon 
therefor, as in proceedings on preliminary attachment or injunction, and
 thereby put at issue the matter of the title or right of possession 
over the specific chattel being replevied, the policy apparently being 
that said matter should be ventilated and determined only at the trial 
on the merits.â
[28]







Besides, these questions require a determination of facts and a 
presentation of evidence, both of which have no place in a petition for 
certiorari in the CA under Rule 65 or in a petition for review in this 
Court under Rule 45.
[29]



Reliance on the Lease Agreement






It should be pointed out that the Court in this case may rely on the 
Lease Agreement, for  nothing on record shows that it has been nullified
 or annulled.  In fact, petitioners assailed it first only in the RTC 
proceedings, which had ironically been instituted by respondent.  
Accordingly, it must be presumed valid and binding as the law between 
the parties.



Makati Leasing and Finance Corporation
[30]

  is also instructive on this point.  In that case, the Deed of Chattel 
Mortgage, which characterized the subject machinery as personal 
property, was also assailed because respondent had allegedly been 
required âto sign a printed form of chattel mortgage which was in a 
blank form at the time of signing.â  The Court rejected the argument and
 relied on the Deed, ruling as follows: 


âx x x.  Moreover, even granting that the charge is true, such fact 
alone does not render a contract void ab initio, but can only be a 
ground for rendering said contract voidable, or annullable pursuant to 
Article 1390 of the new Civil Code, by a proper action in court.  There 
is nothing on record to show that the mortgage has been annulled.  
Neither is it disclosed that steps were taken to nullify the same. x x 
xâ


Alleged Injustice Committed on the Part of Petitioners




Petitioners contend that âif the Court allows these machineries to be 
seized, then its workers would be out of work and thrown into the 
streets.â
[31]
  They also allege that the seizure would nullify all efforts to rehabilitate the corporation. 


Petitionersâ arguments do not preclude the implementation of the Writ.  
As earlier discussed, law and jurisprudence support its propriety.  
Verily, the above-mentioned consequences, if they come true, should not 
be blamed on this Court, but on the petitioners for failing to avail 
themselves of the remedy under Section 5 of Rule 60, which allows the 
filing of a counter-bond.  The provision states:



 âSEC. 5.
 Return of property.
 -  If the adverse party 
objects to the sufficiency of the applicantâs bond, or of the surety or 
sureties thereon, he cannot immediately require the return of the 
property, but if he does not so object, he may, at any time before the 
delivery of the property to the applicant, require the return thereof, 
by filing with the court where the action is pending a bond executed to 
the applicant, in double the value of the property as stated in the 
applicantâs affidavit for the delivery thereof to the applicant, if such
 delivery be adjudged, and for the payment of such sum to him as may be 
recovered against the adverse party, and by serving a copy bond on the 
applicant.â
  






WHEREFORE,
 the Petition is DENIED and the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals AFFIRMED.  Costs against petitioners.
