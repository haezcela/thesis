CIRILO R. VALLES, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND ROSALIND YBASCO LOPEZ, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




PURISIMA, J.:


This is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, pursuant to 
Section 2, Rule 64 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, assailing 
Resolutions dated July 17, 1998 and January 15, 1999, respectively, of 
the Commission on Elections in SPA No. 98-336, dismissing the petition 
for disqualification filed by the herein petitioner, Cirilo R. Valles, 
against private respondent Rosalind Ybasco Lopez, in the May 1998 
elections for governor of Davao Oriental.

Rosalind Ybasco Lopez was born on May 16, 1934 in Napier Terrace,
 Broome, Western Australia, to the spouses, Telesforo Ybasco, a Filipino
 citizen and native of Daet, Camarines  Norte, and Theresa Marquez, an 
Australian.  In 1949, at the age of fifteen, she left Australia and came
 to settle in the Philippines.

On June 27, 1952, she was married to Leopoldo Lopez, a Filipino 
citizen, at the Malate Catholic Church in Manila. Since then, she has 
continuously participated in the electoral process not only as a voter 
but as a candidate, as well.  She served as Provincial Board Member of 
the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Davao Oriental.  In 1992, she ran for 
and was elected governor of Davao Oriental.  Her election was contested 
by her opponent, Gil Taojo, Jr., in a petition for 
quo warranto
,
 docketed as EPC No. 92-54, alleging as ground therefor her alleged 
Australian citizenship.  However, finding no sufficient proof that 
respondent had renounced her Philippine citizenship, the Commission on 
Elections en banc dismissed the petition, ratiocinating thus:



 âA cursory reading of the records of this case vis-a-vis the 
impugned resolution shows that respondent was able to produce 
documentary proofs of the Filipino citizenship of her late father... and
 consequently, prove her own citizenship and filiation by virtue of the 
Principle of Jus Sanguinis, the perorations of the petitioner to the 
contrary notwithstanding. 


On the other hand, except for the three (3) alleged important 
documents . . . no other evidence substantial in nature surfaced to 
confirm the allegations of petitioner that respondent is an Australian 
citizen and not a Filipino.  Express renunciation of citizenship as a 
mode of losing citizenship under Commonwealth Act No. 63 is an equivocal
 and deliberate act with full awareness of its significance and 
consequence.  The evidence adduced by petitioner are inadequate, nay 
meager, to prove that respondent contemplated renunciation of her 
Filipino citizenshipâ.
[1]






In the 1995 local elections, respondent Rosalind Ybasco Lopez ran for
 re-election as governor of Davao Oriental.  Her opponent, Francisco 
Rabat, filed a petition for disqualification, docketed as SPA No. 95-066
 before the COMELEC, First Division, contesting her Filipino citizenship
 but the said petition was likewise dismissed by the COMELEC, 
reiterating substantially its decision in EPC 92-54.

The citizenship of private respondent was once again raised as an
 issue when she ran for re-election as governor of Davao Oriental  in 
the May 11, 1998 elections.  Her candidacy was questioned by the herein 
petitioner, Cirilo Valles, in SPA No. 98-336.

On July 17, 1998, the COMELECâs First Division came out with a Resolution dismissing the petition, and disposing as follows:



 âAssuming arguendo that res judicata does not apply and We are to 
dispose the instant case on the merits trying it de novo, the above 
table definitely shows that petitioner herein has presented no new 
evidence to disturb the Resolution of this Commission in SPA No. 95-066.
  The present petition merely restates the same matters and incidents 
already passed upon by this Commission not just in 1995 Resolution but 
likewise in the Resolution of EPC No. 92-54.  Not having put forth any 
new evidence and matter substantial in nature, persuasive in character 
or sufficiently provocative to compel reversal of such Resolutions, the 
dismissal of the present petition follows as a matter of course. 


xxx xxx xxx
  


 âWHEREFORE, premises considered and there being no new matters and
 issues tendered, We find no convincing reason or impressive explanation
 to disturb and reverse the Resolutions promulgated by this Commission 
in EPC 92-54 and SPA. 95-066. This Commission RESOLVES as it hereby 
RESOLVES to DISMISS the present petition. 


SO ORDERED.â
[2]






Petitioner interposed a motion for reconsideration of the aforesaid 
Resolution but to no avail.  The same was denied by the COMELEC in its 
en banc
 Resolution of January 15, 1999.

Undaunted, petitioner found his way to this Court via the present
 petition; questioning the citizenship of private respondent Rosalind 
Ybasco Lopez.

The Commission on Elections ruled that private respondent 
Rosalind Ybasco Lopez is a Filipino citizen and therefore, qualified to 
run for a public office because (1) her father, Telesforo Ybasco, is a 
Filipino citizen, and by virtue of the principle of 
jus sanguinis

 she was a Filipino citizen under the 1987 Philippine Constitution; (2) 
she was married to a Filipino, thereby making her also a Filipino 
citizen ipso jure under Section 4 of Commonwealth Act 473; (3) and that,
 she renounced her Australian citizenship on January 15, 1992 before the
 Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of Australia and her 
Australian passport was accordingly cancelled as certified to by the 
Australian Embassy in Manila; and (4) furthermore, there are the COMELEC
 Resolutions in EPC No. 92-54 and SPA Case No. 95-066, declaring her a 
Filipino citizen duly qualified to run for the elective position of 
Davao Oriental governor.

Petitioner, on the other hand, maintains that the private 
respondent is an Australian citizen, placing reliance on the admitted 
facts that:



a) In 1988, private respondent registered herself with the Bureau 
of Immigration as an Australian national and was issued Alien 
Certificate of Registration No. 404695 dated September 19, 1988;
  


b) On even date, she applied for the issuance of an Immigrant Certificate of Residence (ICR), and
  


c) She was issued Australian Passport No. H700888 on March 3, 1988.
  




Petitioner theorizes that under the aforestated facts and 
circumstances, the private respondent had renounced her Filipino 
citizenship.  He contends that in her application for alien certificate 
of registration and immigrant certificate of residence, private 
respondent expressly declared under oath that she was a citizen or 
subject of Australia; and said declaration forfeited her Philippine 
citizenship, and operated to disqualify her to run for elective office.

As regards the COMELECâs finding that private respondent had 
renounced her Australian citizenship on January 15, 1992 before the 
Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs of Australia and had her 
Australian passport cancelled on February 11, 1992, as certified to by 
the Australian Embassy here in Manila, petitioner argues that the said 
acts did not automatically restore the status of private respondent as a
 Filipino citizen.  According to petitioner, for the private respondent 
to reacquire Philippine citizenship she must comply with the mandatory 
requirements for repatriation under Republic Act 8171; and the election 
of private respondent to public office did not mean the restoration of 
her Filipino citizenship since the private respondent was not legally 
repatriated.  Coupled with her alleged renunciation of Australian 
citizenship, private respondent has effectively become a stateless 
person and as such, is disqualified to run for a public office in the 
Philippines; petitioner concluded.

Petitioner theorizes further that the Commission on Elections erred in applying the principle of 
res judicata
 to the case under consideration; citing the ruling in 
Moy Ya Lim Yao vs. Commissioner of Immigration
,
[3]
 that:



âxxx Everytime the citizenship of a person is material or 
indispensable in a judicial or administrative case, whatever the 
corresponding court or administrative authority decides therein as to 
such citizenship is generally not considered  as res adjudicata, hence 
it has to be threshed out again and again as the occasion may demand. 
xxxâ
  




The petition is unmeritorious.

The Philippine law on citizenship adheres to the principle of 
jus sanguinis
.
  Thereunder, a child follows the nationality or citizenship of the 
parents regardless of the place of his/her birth, as opposed to the 
doctrine of 
jus soli
 which determines nationality or citizenship on the basis of  place of birth.

Private respondent Rosalind Ybasco Lopez was born on May 16, 1934
 in Napier Terrace, Broome, Western Australia, to the spouses, Telesforo
 Ybasco, a Filipino citizen and native of Daet, Camarines Norte, and 
Theresa Marquez, an Australian.  Historically, this was a year before 
the 1935 Constitution took into effect and at that time, what served as 
the Constitution of the Philippines were the principal organic acts by 
which the United States governed the country.  These were the Philippine
 Bill of July 1, 1902 and the Philippine Autonomy Act of August 29, 
1916, also known as the Jones Law.

Among others, these laws defined who were deemed to be citizens 
of the Philippine islands.   The Philippine Bill of 1902 defined 
Philippine citizens as:



SEC
. 4 xxx  
all inhabitants of the Philippine Islands 
continuing to reside therein who were Spanish subjects on the eleventh 
day of April, eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, and then resided in the 
Philippine Islands, and their children born subsequent thereto, shall be
 deemed and held to be citizens of the Philippine Islands
 and as 
such entitled to the protection of the United States, except such as 
shall have elected to preserve their allegiance to the Crown of Spain in
 accordance with the provisions of the treaty of peace between the 
United States and Spain signed at Paris December tenth, eighteen hundred
 and ninety-eight. (
underscoring ours
)
  




The Jones Law, on the other hand, provides:



SEC
. 2 That 
all inhabitants of the Philippine Islands 
who were Spanish subjects on the eleventh day of April, eighteen hundred
 and ninety-nine, and then resided  in said Islands, and their children 
born subsequent thereto, shall be deemed and held to be citizens of the 
Philippine Islands
, except such as shall have elected to preserve 
their allegiance to the Crown of Spain in accordance with the provisions
 of the treaty of peace between the United States and Spain, signed at 
Paris December tenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and except such
 others as have since become citizens of some other country:  Provided, 
That the Philippine Legislature, herein provided for, is hereby 
authorized to provide by law for the acquisition of Philippine 
citizenship by those natives of the Philippine Islands who cannot come 
within the foregoing provisions, the natives of the insular possessions 
of the United States, and such other persons residing in the Philippine 
Islands who are citizens of the United States, or who could become 
citizens of the United States under the laws of the United States if 
residing therein. (underscoring ours)
  




Under both organic acts, all inhabitants of the Philippines who were 
Spanish subjects on April 11, 1899 and resided therein including their 
children are deemed to be Philippine citizens.  Private respondentâs 
father, Telesforo Ybasco, was born on January 5, 1879 in Daet, Camarines
 Norte, a fact duly evidenced by a certified true copy of an entry in 
the Registry of Births.  Thus, under the Philippine Bill of 1902 and the
 Jones Law, Telesforo Ybasco was deemed to be a Philippine citizen.  By 
virtue of the same laws, which were the laws in force at the time of her
 birth, Telesforoâs daughter, herein private respondent Rosalind Ybasco 
Lopez, is likewise a citizen of the Philippines.

The signing into law of the 1935 Philippine Constitution has established the principle of 
jus sanguinis
 as basis for the acquisition of Philippine citizenship, to wit:



(1) Those who are citizens of the Philippine Islands at the time of the adoption of this Constitution.
  


(2) Those born in the Philippine Islands of foreign parents who, 
before the adoption of this Constitution had been elected to public 
office in the Philippine Islands.
  


(3) Those whose fathers are citizens of the Philippines.
  


(4) Those whose mothers are citizens of the Philippines and, upon reaching the age of majority, elect Philippine citizenship.
  


(5) Those who are naturalized in accordance with law.
  




So also, the principle of jus sanguinis, which confers citizenship by
 virtue of blood relationship, was subsequently retained under the 1973
[4]
 and 1987
[5]

 Constitutions.  Thus, the herein private respondent, Rosalind Ybasco 
Lopez, is a Filipino citizen, having been born to a Filipino father.  
The fact of her being born in Australia is not tantamount to her losing 
her Philippine citizenship.  If Australia follows the principle of jus 
soli, then at most, private respondent can also claim Australian 
citizenship resulting to her possession of dual citizenship.

Petitioner also contends that even on the assumption that the 
private respondent is a Filipino citizen, she has nonetheless renounced 
her Philippine citizenship.  To buttress this contention, petitioner 
cited private respondentâs application for an Alien Certificate of 
Registration (ACR) and Immigrant Certificate of Residence (ICR), on 
September 19, 1988, and the issuance to her of an Australian passport on
 March 3, 1988.

Under Commonwealth Act No. 63, a Filipino citizen may lose his citizenship:



(1) By naturalization in a foreign country;
  


(2) By express renunciation of citizenship;
  


(3) By subscribing to an oath of allegiance to support the 
constitution or laws of a foreign country upon attaining twenty-one 
years of age or more;
  


(4) By accepting commission in the military, naval or air service of a foreign  country;
  


(5) By cancellation of the certificate of naturalization;
  


(6) By having been declared by competent authority, a deserter of 
the Philippine armed forces in time of war, unless subsequently, a 
plenary pardon or amnesty has been granted: and
  


(7) In case of a woman, upon her marriage, to a foreigner if, by 
virtue of the laws in force in her husbandâs country, she acquires his 
nationality. 




In order that citizenship may be lost by renunciation, such 
renunciation must be express.  Petitionerâs contention that the 
application of private respondent for an alien certificate of 
registration, and her Australian passport, is bereft of merit.  This 
issue was put to rest in the case of 
Aznar vs. COMELEC
[6]
 and in the more recent case of
 Mercado vs. Manzano and COMELEC
.
[7]


In the case of Aznar, the Court ruled that the mere fact that 
respondent Osmena was a holder of a certificate stating that he is an 
American did not mean that he is no longer a Filipino, and that an 
application for an alien certificate of registration was not tantamount 
to renunciation of his Philippine citizenship.

And, in 
Mercado vs. Manzano and COMELEC
, it was held 
that the fact that respondent Manzano was registered as an American 
citizen in the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation and was holding an 
American passport on April 22, 1997, only a year before he filed a 
certificate of candidacy for vice-mayor of Makati, were just assertions 
of his American nationality before the termination of his American 
citizenship.

Thus, the mere fact that private respondent Rosalind Ybasco Lopez
 was a holder of an Australian passport and had an alien certificate of 
registration are not acts constituting an effective renunciation of 
citizenship and do not militate against her claim of Filipino 
citizenship.  For renunciation to effectively result in the loss of 
citizenship, the same must be express.
[8]

 As held by this court in the aforecited case of Aznar, an application 
for an alien certificate of registration does not amount to an express 
renunciation or repudiation of oneâs citizenship.  The application of 
the herein private respondent for an alien certificate of registration, 
and her holding of an Australian passport, as in the case of 
Mercado vs. Manzano
,
 were mere acts of assertion of her Australian citizenship before she 
effectively renounced the same.  Thus, at the most, private respondent 
had dual citizenship - she was an Australian and a Filipino, as well.

Moreover, under Commonwealth Act 63, the fact that a child of 
Filipino parent/s was born in another country has not been included as a
 ground for losing oneâs Philippine citizenship.  Since private 
respondent did not lose or renounce her Philippine citizenship, 
petitionerâs claim that respondent must go through the process of 
repatriation does not hold water.

Petitioner also maintains that even on the assumption that the 
private respondent had dual citizenship, still, she is disqualified to 
run for governor of Davao Oriental; citing Section 40 of Republic Act 
7160 otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, which states:



 âSEC. 40.  Disqualifications. The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position: 




xxx xxx xxx
    


 (d) Those with dual citizenship;
    


xxx xxx xxxâ
      






Again, petitionerâs contention is untenable.

In the aforecited case of 
Mercado vs. Manzano
, the Court
 clarified âdual citizenshipâ as used in the Local Government Code and 
reconciled the same with Article IV, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution 
on dual allegiance.
[9]
 
Recognizing situations in which a Filipino citizen may, without 
performing any act, and as an involuntary consequence of the conflicting
 laws of different countries, be also a citizen of another state, the 
Court explained that dual citizenship as a disqualification must refer 
to citizens with dual allegiance.  The Court succinctly pronounced:



 âxxx the phrase âdual citizenshipâ in R.A. No. 7160, xxx 40 (d)  
and in R.A. No. 7854, xxx 20 must be understood as referring to âdual 
allegianceâ.  Consequently, persons with mere dual citizenship do not 
fall under this disqualification.â
  




Thus, the fact that the private respondent had dual citizenship did 
not automatically disqualify her from running for a public office.  
Furthermore, it was ruled that for candidates with dual citizenship, it 
is enough that they elect Philippine citizenship upon the filing of 
their certificate of candidacy, to terminate their status as persons 
with dual citizenship.
[10]
 The
 filing of a certificate of candidacy sufficed to renounce foreign 
citizenship, effectively removing any disqualification as a dual 
citizen.
[11]
 This is so 
because in the certificate of candidacy, one declares that he/she is a 
Filipino citizen and that he/she will support and defend the 
Constitution of the Philippines and will maintain true faith and 
allegiance thereto.  Such declaration, which is under oath, operates as 
an effective renunciation of foreign citizenship.  Therefore, when the 
herein private respondent filed her certificate of candidacy in 1992, 
such fact alone terminated her Australian citizenship.

Then, too, it is significant to note that on January 15 1992, 
private respondent executed a Declaration of Renunciation of Australian 
Citizenship, duly registered in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic
 Affairs of Australia on May 12, 1992.  And, as a result, on February 
11, 1992, the Australian passport of private respondent was cancelled, 
as certified to by Second Secretary Richard F. Munro of the Embassy of 
Australia in Manila.  As aptly appreciated by the COMELEC, the aforesaid
 acts were enough to settle the issue of the alleged dual citizenship of
 Rosalind Ybasco Lopez. Since her renunciation was effective, 
petitionerâs claim that private respondent must go through the whole 
process of repatriation holds no water.

Petitioner maintains further that when citizenship is raised as 
an issue in judicial or administrative proceedings, the resolution or 
decision thereon is generally not considered res judicata in any 
subsequent proceeding challenging the same; citing the case of 
Moy Ya Lim Yao vs. Commissioner of Immigration
.
[12]
 He insists that the same issue of citizenship may be threshed out anew.

Petitioner is correct insofar as the general rule is concerned, 
i.e. the principle of res judicata generally does not apply in cases 
hinging on the issue of citizenship.  However, in the case of 
Burca vs. Republic
,
[13]

 an exception to this general rule was recognized. The Court ruled in 
that case that in order that the doctrine of res judicata may be applied
 in cases of citizenship, the following must be present:



1) a personâs citizenship be raised as a material issue in a controversy where said person is a party; 


2) the Solicitor General or his authorized representative took active part in the resolution thereof, and
  


3) the finding on citizenship is affirmed by this Court.
  




Although the general rule was set forth in the case of 
Moy Ya  Lim Yao
,
 the case did not foreclose the weight of prior rulings on citizenship. 
 It elucidated that reliance may somehow be placed on these antecedent 
official findings, though not really binding, to make the effort easier 
or simpler.
[14]
 Indeed, there 
appears sufficient basis to rely on the prior rulings of the Commission 
on Elections in SPA. No. 95-066 and EPC 92-54 which resolved the issue 
of citizenship in favor of the herein private respondent.  The evidence 
adduced by petitioner is substantially the same evidence presented in 
these two prior cases.  Petitioner failed to show any new evidence or 
supervening event to warrant a reversal of such prior resolutions.  
However, the procedural issue notwithstanding, considered on the merits,
 the petition cannot prosper.

WHEREFORE
, the petition is hereby DISMISSED and 
the COMELEC Resolutions, dated July 17, 1998 and January 15, 1999, 
respectively, in SPA No. 98-336 AFFIRMED.

Private respondent Rosalind Ybasco Lopez is hereby adjudged 
qualified to run for governor of Davao Oriental.  No pronouncement as to
 costs.
