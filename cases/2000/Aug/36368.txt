JOSE S. DUCAT, JR., COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTYS. ARSENIO C. VILLALON, JR. AND CRISPULO DUCUSIN, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




DE LEON, JR., J.:




Before us is a verified letter-complaint
[1]

 for disbarment against Attys. Arsenio C. Villalon, Jr.; Andres Canares,
 Jr. and Crispulo Ducusin for deceit and gross misconduct in violation 
of the lawyerâs oath.  Investigation proceeded only against respondent 
Villalon because it was discovered that Andres Canares was not a lawyer 
while Atty. Crispulo Ducusin passed away on February 3, 1996.
[2]
In the letter-complaint,
[3]

 complainant alleged that on October 29, 1991, respondent Villalon, as 
counsel for the family of complainant, spoke to the father of 
complainant and asked that he be given the title over a property owned 
by complainant located in Pinugay, Antipolo, Rizal and covered by TCT 
No. M-3023, Emancipation Patent No. 410414, because he allegedly had to 
verify the proper measurements of the subject property.  Sometime in 
November, 1991, however, complainant and his family were surprised when 
several people entered the subject property and, when confronted by the 
companions of complainant, the latter were told that they were workers 
of Canares and were there to construct a piggery.  Complainant 
complained to the barangay authorities in Pinugay and narrated the 
incident but respondent Canares did not appear before it and continued 
with the construction of the piggery in the presence of armed men who 
were watching over the construction.  Complainant then went to 
respondent Villalon to complain about the people of respondent Canares 
but nothing was done.

Complainant then filed a case for ejectment against respondent 
Canares.  In his Reply however, the latter answered that the subject 
property was already sold by complainant to respondent Canares in the 
amount of P450,000.00 as evidenced by the Deed of Absolute Sale of Real 
Property dated December 5, 1991 and notarized by respondent Atty. 
Crispulo Ducusin.  Complainant, however, averred that he never sold the 
property, signed any document nor received any money therefor, and he 
also denied having appeared before respondent Ducusin who was the notary
 public for the Deed of Absolute Sale.  Complainant discovered that 
respondent Villalon claimed that complainantâs father allegedly gave the
 subject property to him (respondent Villalon) as evidenced by a 
document of sale purportedly signed by complainant.

In his Comment,
[4]
 
respondent Villalon denied that allegations of the complainant and in 
turn, he alleged that the property was given voluntarily by Jose Ducat, 
Sr. to him out of close intimacy and for past legal services rendered.  
Thereafter, respondent Villalon, with the knowledge and consent of Jose 
Ducat, Sr., allowed the subject property to be used by Andres Canares to
 start a piggery business without any monetary consideration.  A Deed of
 Sale of Parcel of Land was then signed by Jose Ducat, Sr. to evidence 
that he has conveyed the subject property to respondent Villalon with 
the name of respondent Canares included therein as protection because of
 the improvements to be introduced in the subject property.  Upon 
presenting the title covering the subject property, it was discovered 
that the property was registered in the name of Jose Ducat, Jr. and not 
Jose Ducat, Sr., but the latter told respondents Villalon and Canares 
not to worry because the land was actually owned by him and that he 
merely placed the name of his son, Jose Ducat, Jr.  Jose Ducat, Sr. then
 suggested that the subject property be transferred directly from Jose 
Ducat, Jr. to respondent Canares; hence, he (Ducat, Sr.) got the title 
and guaranteed that he would return the document already signed and 
notarized, which he did the following day.  According to respondent 
Canares, the trouble began when Jose Ducat, Sr. came to his office 
demanding to know why he was not allowed to cut the trees inside the 
subject property by the caretaker of respondent Canares.

On January 21, 1993, Jose Ducat, Jr. wrote
[5]

 to this Court and averred that he neither signed the Deed of Sale 
covering the subject property nor did he appear before the notary public
 Crispulo Ducusin, who notarized the same.  He averred that respondents 
Villalon and Ducusin should be disbarred from the practice of law and 
respondent Villalon be imprisoned for forging his signature and selling 
the subject property without his consent.

In his Rejoinder
[6]
, 
respondent Villalon denied the allegations of complainant and maintained
 that he is a member of good standing of the Integrated Bar and that he 
has always preserved the high standards of the legal profession.  
Respondent Villalon expressed his willingness to have the Deed of Sale 
examined by the National Bureau of Investigation and reiterated that the
 subject property was orally given to him by Jose Ducat, Sr. and it was 
only in October, 1991 that the conveyance was reduced in writing.  He 
added that the complainant knew that his father, Jose Ducat, Sr., was 
the person who signed the said document for and in his behalf and that 
this was done with his consent and knowledge.

This Court referred
[7]
 the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for investigation, report and recommendation.

On May 17, 1997, the IBP Board of Governors passed a resolution 
adopting and approving the report and recommendation of its 
Investigating Commissioner who found respondent Atty. Villalon guilty, 
and recommended his suspension from the practice of law for two (2) 
years and likewise directed respondent Atty. Villalon to deliver to the 
complainant his TCT No. M-3023 within ten (10) days from receipt of 
notice, otherwise, this will result in his disbarment.

The findings of IBP Investigating Commissioner Victor C. Fernandez are as follows:



Complainant and his witness, Jose Ducat, Sr., testified in a 
straightforward, spontaneous and candid manner.  The sincerity and 
demeanor they displayed while testifying before the Commission inspire 
belief as to the truth of what they are saying.  More importantly, 
respondent failed to impute any ill-motive on the part of the 
complainant and his witness which can impel them to institute the 
instant complaint and testify falsely against him.  To be sure, the 
testimony of the complainant and his witness deserves the Commissionâs 
full faith and credence. 


Respondentâs evidence, on the other hand, leaves much to be 
desired.  His defense (that he considered himself the owner of the 
subject property which was allegedly given to him by Jose Ducat, Sr.) 
rings hollow in the face of a welter of contravening and 
incontrovertible facts. 


FIRST, the registered owner of the subject property is complainant 
Jose Ducat, Jr.  Accordingly, respondent (being a lawyer) knew or ought 
to know that Jose Ducat, Sr. could not possibly give to him the said 
property unless the former is duly authorized by the complainant through
 a Special Power of Attorney.  No such authorization has been given.  
Moreover, Jose Ducat, Sr. has vigorously denied having given the subject
 property to the respondent.  This denial is not too difficult to 
believe considering the fact that he (Jose Ducat, Sr.) is not the owner 
of said property.
  


SECOND, being a lawyer, respondent knew or ought to know that 
conveyance of a real property, whether gratuitously or for a 
consideration, must be in writing.  Accordingly, it is unbelievable that
 he would consider himself the owner of the subject property on the 
basis of the verbal or oral âgivingâ of the property by Jose Ducat, Sr. 
no matter how many times the latter may have said that. 


THIRD, the Deed of Sale of Parcel of Land (Exh. â1â for the 
respondent and Exh. âA-2â for the complainant) allegedly executed by 
Jose Ducat, Sr. in favor of respondent Atty. Arsenio Villalon and/or 
Andres Canares, Jr. covering the subject parcel of land which respondent
 prepared allegedly upon instruction of Jose Ducat, Sr. is of dubious 
character.  As earlier adverted to, Jose Ducat, Sr. is not the owner of 
said property.  Moreover, said Deed of Sale of Parcel of Land is a 
falsified document as admitted by the respondent himself when he said 
that the signature over the typewritten name Maria Cabrido (wife of Jose
 Ducat, Sr.) was affixed by Jose Ducat, Sr.  Being a lawyer, respondent 
knew or ought to know that the act of Jose Ducat, Sr. in affixing his 
wifeâs signature is tantamount to a forgery.  Accordingly, he should 
have treated the said Deed of Sale of Parcel of Land has (sic) a mere 
scrap of worthless paper instead of relying on the same to substantiate 
his claim that the subject property was given to him by Jose Ducat, Sr. 
 Again, of note is the fact that Jose Ducat, Sr. has vigorously denied 
having executed said document which denial is not too difficult to 
believe in the light of the circumstances already mentioned. 


FOURTH, the Deed of Absolute Sale of Real Property (Exh. â2â for 
the respondent and Exh. âA-3â for the complainant) allegedly executed by
 Jose Ducat, Jr. in favor of Andres Canares, Jr. over the subject 
property (which respondent claims he prepared upon instruction of Jose 
Ducat, Sr.) is likewise of questionable character.  Complainant Jose 
Ducat, Jr. has vigorously denied having executed said document.  He 
claims that he has never sold said property to Andres Canares, Jr. whom 
he does not know; that he has never appeared before Atty. Crispulo 
Ducusin to subscribe to the document; and that he has never received the
 amount of P450,000.00 representing the consideration of said 
transaction.  More importantly, the infirmity of the said Deed of 
Absolute Sale of Real Property was supplied by the respondent no less 
when he admitted that there was no payment of P450,000.00 and that the 
same was placed in the document only to make it appear that the 
conveyance was for a consideration.  Accordingly, and being a lawyer, 
respondent knew or ought to know the irregularity of his act and that he
 should have treated the document as another scrap of worthless paper 
instead of utilizing the same to substantiate his defense.
[8]






After a careful consideration of the record of the instant case, it 
appears that the findings of facts and observations of the Investigating
 Commissioner, Integrated Bar of the Philippines, which were all adopted
 by its Board of Governors, are well-taken, the same being supported by 
the evidence adduced.

The ethics of the legal profession rightly enjoin lawyers to act 
with the highest standards of truthfulness, fair play and nobility in 
the course of his practice of law.  A lawyer may be disciplined or 
suspended for any misconduct, whether in his professional or private 
capacity, which shows him to be wanting in moral character, in honesty, 
in probity and good demeanor, thus rendering unworthy to continue as an 
officer of the court.
[9]
 Canon
 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility mandates that âa lawyer 
shall at all times uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal 
profession.â  The trust and confidence necessarily reposed by clients 
require in the lawyer a high standard and appreciation of his duty to 
them.  To this end, nothing should be done by any member of the legal 
fraternity which might tend to lessen in any degree the confidence of 
the public in the fidelity, honesty, and integrity of the profession.
[10]


It has been established that the subject parcel of land, with an 
area of five (5) hectares located in Barrio Pinugay, Antipolo, Rizal, is
 owned by and registered in the name of complainant herein, Jose Ducat, 
Jr.  Respondent Villalon insists nonetheless that the property was 
orally given to him by complainantâs father, Jose Ducat, Sr., allegedly 
with the complete knowledge of the fact that the subject property 
belonged to his son, Jose Ducat, Jr.  It is basic law, however, that 
conveyance or transfer of any titled real property must be in writing, 
signed by the registered owner or at least by his attorney-in-fact by 
virtue of a proper special power of attorney and duly notarized.  
Respondent Villalon, as a lawyer, is presumed to know, or ought to know,
 this process.  Worse, when the transfer was first reduced in writing in
 October, 1991 per Deed of Sale of Parcel of Land,
[11]

 purportedly in favor of âAtty. Arsenio C. Villalon and/or Andres 
Canares, Jr.,â respondent Villalon knew that it was Jose Ducat, Sr. who 
signed the said document of sale without any Special Power of Attorney 
from the registered owner thereof, Jose Ducat, Jr.; and that Jose Ducat,
 Sr. also signed it for his wife, Maria Cabrido, under the word 
âConformeâ.  As regards the subsequent Deed of Absolute Sale of Real 
Property dated December 5, 1991, covering the same property, this time 
purportedly in favor of Andres Canares, Jr. only, respondent Villalon 
admitted that there was in fact no payment of P450,000.00 and that the 
said amount was placed in that document only to make it appear that the 
conveyance was for a consideration.

All these taken together, coupled with complainant Jose Ducat, 
Jr.âs strong and credible denial that he allegedly sold the subject 
property to respondent Villalon and/or Andres Canares, Jr. and that he 
allegedly appeared before respondent notary public Ducusin, convince us 
that respondent Villalonâs acts herein complained of which constitute 
gross misconduct were duly proven.

Public confidence in law and lawyers may be eroded by the 
irresponsible and improper conduct of a member of the Bar.  Thus, every 
lawyer should act and comport himself in such a manner that would 
promote public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession.  
Members of the Bar are expected to always live up to the standards of 
the legal profession as embodied in the Code of Professional 
Responsibility inasmuch as the relationship between an attorney and his 
client is highly fiduciary in nature and demands utmost fidelity and 
good faith.
[12]


We find, however, the IBPâs recommended penalty of two (2) years 
suspension to be imposed upon respondent Atty. Villalon too severe in 
the light of the facts obtaining in the case at bar.  In Cesar V. Roces 
vs. Atty. Jose G. Aportadera,
[13]

 this Court suspended therein respondent Atty. Aportadera for a period 
of two (2) years from the practice of law for two main reasons:



(i) His dubious involvement in the preparation and notarization of 
the falsified sale of his clientâs property merits the penalty of 
suspension imposed on him by the IBP Board of Governors;  and 


(ii) The NBI investigation reveals that: (1) respondent 
misrepresented himself to Gregorio Licuanan as being duly authorized by 
Isabel Roces to sell her property; (2) it was respondent who prepared 
the various deeds of sale over Isabelâs subdivision lots; (3) Isabel was
 already confined at a hospital in Metro Manila on January 4, 1980, the 
deedâs date of execution; (4) respondent knew that Isabel was 
hospitalized in Metro Manila when he subscribed the deed; (5) he knew 
that Isabel died in Metro Manila soon after her confinement; and (6) he 
did not give the seller a copy of the questioned deed of sale.
[14]






Unlike the circumstances prevailing in the said case of 
Aportadera
,
 the record does not show that respondent Villalon had any direct 
participation in the notarization by respondent notary public Crispulo 
Ducusin of the Deed of Absolute Sale of Real Property dated December 5, 
1991,
[15]
 which was supposedly
 signed by complainant Jose Ducat, Jr. who, however, strongly denied 
having signed the same.  The earlier Deed of Sale of Parcel of Land 
dated âthis ___day of October 1991,â allegedly signed by Jose S. Ducat, 
Sr., as vendor, covering the same property, in favor of respondent 
âArsenio S. Villalon and/or Andres Canares, Jr.â was not notarized.  The
 record also shows that Jose Ducat, Sr. and complainant Jose Ducat, Jr. 
are father and son and that they live in the same house at 912 Leo 
Street, Sampaloc, Manila.  It is not also disputed that respondent 
Villalon has been the lawyer for a number of years of the family of Jose
 Ducat, Sr.

WHEREFORE
, respondent ATTY. ARSENIO C. VILLALON,
 JR. is hereby found guilty of gross misconduct, and he is SUSPENDED 
from the practice of law for a period of ONE (1) YEAR with a warning 
that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more 
severely.  Respondent Villalon is further directed to deliver to the 
registered owner, complainant Jose Ducat Jr., the latterâs TCT No. 
M-3023 covering the subject property within a period of  sixty (60) days
 from receipt of this Decision, at his sole expense;  and that failure 
on his part to do so will result in his disbarment.

Let a copy of this Decision be attached to Atty. Villalonâs 
personal record in the Office of the Bar Confidant and copies thereof be
 furnished the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.
