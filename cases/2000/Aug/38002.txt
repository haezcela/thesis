EDUARDO A. ALARILLA, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN (FIRST DIVISION), RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




GONZAGA-REYES, J.:




In this petition for 
certiorari 
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, petitioner alleges that the Sandiganbayan
[1]

  gravely abused its discretion when it issued its Resolution dated July
 28, 1998 denying his demurrer to evidence and the subsequent Resolution
 dated December 17, 1998 denying his motion for reconsideration in 
Criminal Case No. 23069.
[2]

The factual background of this case is set out herein:


On December 1, 1995, the Office of the Ombudsman, acting through the Office of the Special Prosecutor, filed an information
[3]

  with the Sandiganbayan charging petitioner Eduardo A. Alarilla with 
the crime of grave threats as defined in Article 282 of the Revised 
Penal Code.  On the same day, a second information
[4]

  was filed charging petitioner of having violated section 3 (e) of 
Republic Act No. 3019.  These informations were docketed as Criminal 
Case Nos. 23069 and 23070, respectively.


Criminal Case No. 23070 was raffled to the Second Division of the 
Sandiganbayan. Acting upon a motion for reinvestigation filed by 
petitioner, the Office of the Special Prosecutor filed a motion to 
withdraw the information
[5]
 , which motion was eventually granted by the Sandiganbayan on July 16, 1996.
[6]



Meanwhile, Criminal Case No. 23069 was assigned to the First Division of
 the Sandiganbayan.  Petitioner also filed a motion for reinvestigation 
with the court on May 8, 1996, to which the prosecution objected.  On 
June 18, 1996, the court issued a resolution deferring action on 
petitionerâs motion for reinvestigation until compliance by the 
prosecution with the courtâs resolution of March 20 and 28, 1996, 
requiring the amendment of the information so as to indicate the 
âoffice-relatedâ character of the crime charged.  On November 8, 1996, 
the Office of the Special Prosecutor filed an ex-parte motion
[7]
  for the admission of an amended information which reads -




    That on or about October 13, 1982, in Meycauayan, Bulacan, and 
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, a public officer, being then the Municipal Mayor of Meycauayan,
 Bulacan, committing the crime herein charged in relation to and taking 
advantage of his official functions, did then and there wilfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously level and aim a .45 caliber pistol at and 
threaten to kill one Simeon G. Legaspi, during a public hearing about 
the pollution from the operations of the Giant Achievers Enterprises 
Plastic Factory and after the said complainant rendered a privilege 
speech critical of the abuses and excesses of the administration of said
 accused.
  





In its resolution
[8]
  of January 30, 1997, the Sandiganbayan admitted the amended information.


Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration,
[9]

  praying that the court reconsider its admission of the amended 
information.  He claimed that the crimes charged in Criminal Case Nos. 
23069 and 23070 arose out of the same incident; that considering that 
the latter case had already been dismissed by the court on the ground 
that it had no jurisdiction over the same since the crime charged was 
not âoffice-related,â the same ruling should apply to the former case.  
After the prosecution had filed its comment,
[10]
  the First Division issued a resolution
[11]

  on April 25, 1997, denying petitionerâs motion for reinvestigation of 
Criminal Case No. 23069 and his motion for reconsideration.  With 
regards to the issue of jurisdiction, the Sandiganbayan held that â


In criminal cases, the courtâs jurisdiction in the first instance is 
determined by the facts alleged in the complaint or information.  The 
complaint or information must be examined for the purpose of 
ascertaining whether or not the facts set out therein and the punishment
 provided for by law for such acts fall within the jurisdiction of the 
court in which the complaint or information is presented.  If the facts 
set out in the complaint or information are sufficient to show the court
 in which the complaint or information is presented has jurisdiction, 
then the court has jurisdiction (U.S. vs. Mallari, 24 Phil 366; Magay 
vs. Estiandan, 69 SCRA 456; Enerio vs. Alampay, 64 SCRA 142).


A perusal of the Amended Information in the instant case readily shows 
that the felony allegedly committed was âoffice-related,â hence, within 
the jurisdiction of this court.  It is alleged therein that accused 
mayor committed the crime of grave threats when he levelled and aimed 
his gun at and threatened to kill private complainant Simeon Legazpi 
during a public hearing about the pollution which resulted from the 
operation of Giant Achievers Enterprises Plastic Factory and after said 
complainant rendered a privileged speech critical of the abuses and 
excesses of the administration of the accused.  As the local chief 
executive, the health and sanitation problem of the community was one of
 the accusedâs main concern[s].  Thus, accused was performing his 
official duty as municipal mayor when he attended said public hearing.  
It is apparent from the allegations, that, although public office is not
 an element of the crime of grave threat[s] in abstract, as committed by
 the accused, there is an intimate connection/relation between the 
commission of the offense and accusedâs performance of his public 
office.


Moreover, accusedâs violent act was precipitated by complainantâs 
criticism of his administration as the mayor or chief executive of the 
municipality, during the latterâs privilege speech.  It was his response
 to private complainantâs attack to his office.  If he was not the 
mayor, he would not have been irritated or angered by whatever private 
complainant might have said during said privilege speech.




xxx                                    xxx                              xxx




The ruling in Criminal Case No. 23070 relied upon by the accused will 
not apply in this case, because the offense involved there was [a] 
[v]iolation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. 3019.  It is an essential element 
of said offense that the act of the accused in causing undue injury to 
any party including the Government or the giving to any party of 
unwarranted benefits, advantage or perference was done in the course of 
the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial function.  The
 ponente, the Hon. Jose S. Balajadia, however, found the said 
circumstance not obtaining in the said case (Crim. Case No. 23070) 
because the incident complained of took place after the public hearing 
when the accused was not anymore performing any of his official 
administrative functions.  The difference lies in the fact that in the 
case at bar (grave threats), said condition is not a component element. 
 All that the law requires for the crime to be within the jurisdiction 
of this court is the fact that the felony was committed âin relation to 
his officeâ (not during the discharge of his official function).


PREMISES CONSIDERED, and on the further ground that accusedâs primary 
intent in pleading a reinvestigation is the determination of the 
âoffice-relatedâ character of the crime, which is now passed upon, his 
Motion for Reinvestigation is hereby DENIED due course.  His Motion for 
Reconsideration of the Courtâs Resolution dated January 30, 1997 is 
likewise DENIED for lack of merit.


Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the above cited ruling, but the Sandiganbayan denied the same in its resolution
[12]
  dated June 18, 1997.  Thus, petitioner was prompted to file a petition for 
certiorari
[13]

  with this Court questioning the Sandiganbayanâs April 25, 1997 and 
June 18, 1997 resolutions, which case was docketed as G.R. No. 130231.  
However, in our resolution
[14]

  dated September 22, 1997, we dismissed the petition âfor failure to 
sufficiently show that the questioned [resolutions were] tainted with 
grave abuse of discretion.â


Thus, the trial of Criminal Case No. 23069 proceeded.  On May 19, 1998, 
after the prosecution had completed the presentation of its evidence, 
petitioner filed a demurrer to evidence
[15]

  on the ground that the prosecution had failed to prove that he had 
committed the crime charged in the information and that the act 
complained of took place while he was performing his official functions.


In a resolution
[16]
  dated July 28, 1998, the Sandiganbayan denied petitionerâs demurrer to evidence.  The resolution states that â




xxx                                    xxx                              xxx




The accused herein is charged with having threatened to kill Simeon 
Legaspi by pointing a .45 caliber pistol at him.  There is evidence on 
record that the acts were indeed committed. Regardless of whether or not
 the pistol was cocked, the pointing of a firearm at a person in a 
hostile manner is an act demonstrating an intent to inflict harm to that
 person.  Whether or not the accused Mayor was in the performance of his
 proper duties when he pointed the .45 caliber pistol is not a proper 
issue of jurisdiction for this Court since all illegal acts are never 
proper acts of oneâs public office.  What is at evidence is that an 
ordinary citizen was not in a position to convoke the Sanggunian Bayan 
nor to preside over the same, much less to interfere with the 
legislative proceedings of the Municipal Council which, because he as 
mayor, the accused could and did, even if unlawfully.


xxx                                    xxx                              xxx


Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration was similarly denied by the Sandiganbayan in its December 17, 1998 resolution
[17]
  explaining that â


xxx                                    xxx                              xxx


Indeed, an illegal act is not an official act; rather the question boils
 down to whether or not the acts attributed to the accused herein were 
performed by him in the occasion of either the performance of his duties
 or of his assertion of his authority to do so.  Were the rule to be 
otherwise, the Sandiganbayan would never have jurisdiction of criminal 
acts of public officers since these acts would never be the performance 
of official duties or be official acts, although they might be in the 
occasion thereof.


xxx                                    xxx                              xxx


Hence, the present petition wherein petitioner asks this Court to set 
aside the July 28, 1998 and December 17, 1998 resolutions of the 
Sandiganbayan and to dismiss Criminal Case No. 23069.  In addition, 
petitioner prays for the issuance of a temporary restraining order 
and/or writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin public respondent from 
further proceeding with said case until this petition has been resolved.
[18]



The Office of the Special Prosecutor filed its Comment
[19]
  on April 22, 1999.  On May 18, 1999, petitioner filed a motion to resolve
[20]

  his application for a temporary restraining order and/or writ of 
preliminary injunction in order to enjoin the Sandiganbayan from further
 proceeding with the case, which prayer he reiterated in a subsequent 
motion
[21]
  filed with this 
Court on July 22, 1999.  On September 6, 1999, the Court denied 
petitionerâs July 22, 1999 motion for lack of merit.
[22]
  Petitioner filed a Reply
[23]
  on December 6, 1999.  The prosecution and the defense then filed their respective Memorandums on March 16, 2000
[24]
  and on March 30, 2000,
[25]
  respectively, after which the case was deemed submitted for decision.


Petitioner sets forth the following issues for the Courtâs resolution  -



 I. WHETHER OR NOT THE FIRST DIVISION OF THE SANDIGANBAYAN ACTED 
WITHOUT OR IN EXCESS OF ITS JURISDICTION OR WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF 
DISCRETION IN DENYING PETITIONERâS DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE. 



    II. WHETHER OR NOT THE FIRST DIVISION OF THE SANDIGANBAYAN ACTED 
WITHOUT OR IN EXCESS OF ITS JURISDICTION OR WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF 
DISCRETION IN RULING THAT THE OFFENSE CHARGED IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 23069
 FALLS WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION.
  



    III. WHETHER OR NOT PETITIONER SHOULD BE GRANTED INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
[26]







With regard to the first issue, petitioner claims that the elements 
constituting the crime of grave threats have not been proven.  He 
insists that the prosecution had not established that his act of 
pointing a gun at complainant Simeon Legaspi, assuming that it had 
actually occurred, constituted grave threats.
[27]

  However, quite to the contrary, the Sandiganbayan found that the 
prosecutionâs evidence, standing unrebutted by any opposing evidence, 
sufficiently established the crime charged.
[28]



The resolution of a demurrer to evidence should be left to the exercise 
of sound judicial discretion.  A lower courtâs order of denial shall not
 be disturbed, that is, the appellate courts will not review the 
prosecutionâs evidence and precipitately decide whether or not such 
evidence has established the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable 
doubt, unless accused has established that such judicial discretion has 
been gravely abused, thereby amounting to a lack or excess of 
jurisdiction.
[29]
  Mere allegations of such abuse will not suffice.  For the special civil action of 
certiorari 
to lie, it is crucial that


â¦there must be a capricious, arbitrary and whimsical exercise of power, 
the very antithesis of judicial prerogative in accordance with centuries
 of both civil law and common law traditions.  To warrant the issuance 
of the extraordinary writ of 
certiorari
, the alleged lack of 
jurisdiction, excess thereof, or abuse of discretion must be so gross or
 grave, as when power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by
 reason of passion, prejudice or personal hostility, or the abuse must 
be so patent as to amount to an evasion of positive duty, or to a 
virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all, in 
contemplation of law.  xxx 
[30]



When there is no showing of such grave abuse, 
certiorari 
is not the proper remedy.
[31]

  Rather, the appropriate recourse from an order denying a demurrer to 
evidence is for the court to proceed with the trial, after which the 
accused may file an appeal from the judgment of the lower court rendered
 after such trial.
[32]
  In the
 present case, we are not prepared to rule that the Sandiganbayan has 
gravely abused its discretion when it denied petitionerâs demurrer to 
evidence.  Public respondent found that the prosecutionâs evidence 
satisfactorily established the elements of the crime charged.  
Correspondingly, there is nothing in the records of this case nor in the
 pleadings of petitioner that would show otherwise.


Coming now to the second issue, petitioner assails the Sandiganbayanâs 
jurisdiction over the case on the ground that the crime was not 
committed in relation to his office.  He contends that it has not been 
established that the crime charged was committed by him while in the 
discharge of or as a consequence of his official functions as municipal 
mayor.  Additionally, he claims that public office is not an essential 
ingredient of the crime of grave threats, which may be committed by a 
public officer and a private individual alike, with the same facility.  
Therefore, the Sandiganbayan erroneously assumed jurisdiction over the 
present case.
[33]



It is well established that the jurisdiction of a court to try a 
criminal case is determined by the law in force at the time of the 
institution of the action.  Once the court acquires jurisdiction over a 
controversy, it shall continue to exercise such jurisdiction until the 
final determination of the case and it is not affected by subsequent 
legislation vesting jurisdiction over such proceedings in another 
tribunal.  A recognized exception to this rule is when the statute 
expressly provides, or is construed to the effect that it is intended to
 operate upon actions pending before its enactment.  However, where such
 retroactive effect is not provided for, statutes altering the 
jurisdiction of a court cannot be applied to cases already pending prior
 to their enactment.
[34]



The original information in Criminal Case No. 23069 was filed with the 
Sandiganbayan on December 1, 1995, whereas the amended information was 
filed with the same court on November 8, 1996 and admitted by the 
Sandiganbayan on January 30, 1997.  The applicable law at this time 
would be Presidential Decree No. 1606 (PD 1606), as amended by Republic 
Act No. 7975 (RA 7975),
[35]
  which took effect on May 16, 1995.
[36]
  Section 4 of PD 1606, as amended by RA 7975, provides that â


The Sandiganbayan shall exercise original jurisdiction in all cases involving:




    a.  Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known
 as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act No. 1379, and
 Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII of the Revised Penal Code, xxx
  





      xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
    



    b.  Other offenses or felonies committed by the public officials and
 employees mentioned in subsection (a) of this section in relation to 
their office.
  







xxx                                    xxx                              xxx




Thus, to fall within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan, the crime charged must be either one of those mentioned 
in paragraph (a) abovementioned or one committed by a public officer in 
relation to his office.  The Court has held that an offense is deemed to
 be committed in relation to the accusedâs office when such office is an
 element of the crime charged
[37]

  or when the offense charged is intimately connected with the discharge
 of the official functions of accused.  This was our ruling in Cunanan 
v. Arceo
[38]
  wherein the Court explained several decisions dealing with the Sandiganbayanâs jurisdiction.  The Court held â



 In 
Sanchez v. Demetriou 
[227 SCRA 627 (1993)], the Court 
elaborated on the scope and reach of the term âoffense committed in 
relation to [an accusedâs] officeâ by referring to the principle laid 
down in 
Montilla v. Hilario 
[90 Phil 49 (1951)], and to an 
exception to that principle which was recognized in People v. Montejo 
[108 Phil 613 (1960)].  The principle set out in Montilla v. Hilario is 
that an offense may be considered as committed in relation to the 
accusedâs office if âthe offense cannot exist without the officeâ such 
that âthe office [is] a constituent element of the crime x x x.â In 
People v. Montejo, the Court, through Chief Justice Concepcion, said 
that âalthough public office is not an element of the crime of murder in
 [the] abstract,â the facts in a particular case may show that 


 âx x x 
the offense therein charged is intimately connected 
with [the accusedâs] respective offices and was perpetrated while they 
were in the performance, though improper or irregular, of their official
 functions.  Indeed, [the accused] had no personal motive to commit the 
crime and they would not have committed it had they not held their 
aforesaid offices. 
x x xâ
  





The jurisdiction of a court is determined by the allegations in the complaint or information.
[39]

  In the case at bar, the amended information contained allegations that
 the accused, petitioner herein, took advantage of his official 
functions as municipal mayor of Meycauayan, Bulacan when he committed 
the crime of grave threats as defined in Article 282 of the Revised 
Penal Code against complainant Simeon G. Legaspi, a municipal councilor.
  The Office of the Special Prosecutor charged petitioner with aiming a 
gun at and threatening to kill Legaspi during a public hearing, after 
the latter had rendered a privilege speech critical of petitionerâs 
administration.  Clearly, based on such allegations, the crime charged 
is intimately connected with the discharge of petitionerâs official 
functions.  This was elaborated upon by public respondent in its April 
25, 1997 resolution wherein it held that the âaccused was performing his
 official duty as municipal mayor when he attended said public hearingâ 
and that âaccusedâs violent act was precipitated by complainantâs 
criticism of his administration as the mayor or chief executive of the 
municipality, during the latterâs privilege speech.  It was his response
 to private complainantâs attack to his office.  If he was not the 
mayor, he would not have been irritated or angered by whatever private 
complainant might have said during said privilege speech.â Thus, based 
on the allegations in the information, the Sandiganbayan correctly 
assumed jurisdiction over the case.
