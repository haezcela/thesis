PHILIPPINE BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, COURT OF TAX APPEALS, AND COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENTS.

PURISIMA, J.:


At bar is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking a review of the decision
[1]

 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 34095 which affirmed the 
decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in C.T.A. Case No. 4419.

The facts that matter are as follows:

On June 21, 1989, the petitioner received an assessment letter 
from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (respondent Commissioner) for 
the payment of deficiency amusement tax computed thus:







Deficiency Amusement Tax

Total Amount Due & Collectible


P 5,864,260.84








On July 18, 1989, petitioner contested the assessment by filing a 
protest with respondent Commissioner who denied the same on November 6, 
1989.

On January 8, 1990, petitioner filed a petition for review
[2]
 with the Court of Tax Appeals (respondent CTA) questioning the denial by respondent Commissioner of its tax protest.

On December 24, 1993, respondent CTA dismissed petitionerâs petition, holding:



"WHEREFORE, in all the foregoing, herein petition for review is 
hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit and the Petitioner is hereby ORDERED 
to PAY to the Respondent the amount of P5,864,260.84 as deficiency 
amusement tax for the year 1987 plus 20% annual delinquency interest 
from July 22, 1989 which is the due date appearing on the notice and 
demand of the Commissioner (i.e. 30 days from receipt of the assessment)
 until fully paid pursuant to the provisions of Sections 248 and 249 (c)
 (3) of the Tax Code, as amended."
[3]






Petitioner presented a motion for reconsideration
[4]
 of the said decision but the same was denied by respondent CTA in a resolution
[5]

 dated April 8, 1994. Thereafter and within the reglementary period for 
interposing appeals, petitioner appealed the CTA decision to the Court 
of Appeals.

On November 21, 1994, the Court of Appeals rendered its questioned Decision,
[6]

 affirming the decision of the CTA and dismissing petitionerâs appeal. 
Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of said decision but to no
 avail. The same was denied by the Court of Appeals in a Resolution
[7]
 dated January 31, 1995. Hence, this petition.

Undaunted, petitioner found its way to this Court via the present petition, contending that:



"1. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that the 
jurisdiction to collect amusement taxes of PBA games is vested in the 
national government to the exclusion of the local governments. 


"2. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that Section 13 of
 the Local Tax Code of 1973 limits local government units to theaters, 
cinematographs, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement in
 the collection of the amusement tax. 


"3. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that Revenue 
Regulations No. 8-88 dated February 19, 1988 is an erroneous 
interpretation of law. 


"4. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in giving retroactive effect to the revocation of Revenue Regulations 8-88. 


"5. Respondent Court of Appeals erred when it failed to consider 
the provisions of P.D. 851 the franchise of Petitioner, Section 8 of 
which provides that amusement tax on admission receipts of Petitioner is
 5%. 


"6. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that the cession 
of advertising and streamer spaces in the venue to a third person is 
subject to amusement taxes. 


"7. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that the cession 
of advertising and streamer spaces inside the venue is embraced within 
the term âgross receiptsâ as defined in Section 123 (6) of the Tax Code.
 


"8. Respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that the amusement tax liability of Petitioner is subject to a 75% surcharge."
  




The issues for resolution in this case may be simplified as follows:

 Is the amusement tax on admission tickets to PBA games a national
 or local tax? Otherwise put, who between the national government and 
local government should petitioner pay amusement taxes? 
 Is the cession of advertising and streamer spaces to Vintage Enterprises, Inc. (VEI) subject to the payment of amusement tax? 
 If ever petitioner is liable for the payment of deficiency 
amusement tax, is it liable to pay a seventy-five percent (75%) 
surcharge on the deficiency amount due? 


Petitioner contends that PD 231, otherwise known as the Local Tax 
Code of 1973, transferred the power and authority to levy and collect 
amusement taxes from the sale of admission tickets to places of 
amusement from the national government to the local governments. 
Petitioner cited BIR Memorandum Circular No. 49-73 providing that the 
power to levy and collect amusement tax on admission tickets was 
transferred to the local governments by virtue of the Local Tax Code; 
and BIR Ruling No. 231-86 which held that "the jurisdiction to levy 
amusement tax on gross receipts from admission tickets to places of 
amusement was transferred to local governments under P.D. No. 231, as 
amended."
[8]
 Further, 
petitioner opined that even assuming arguendo that respondent 
Commissioner revoked BIR Ruling No. 231-86, the reversal, modification 
or revocation cannot be given retroactive effect since even as late as 
1988 (BIR Memorandum Circular No. 8-88), respondent Commissioner still 
recognized the jurisdiction of local governments to collect amusement 
taxes.

The Court is not persuaded by petitionerâs asseverations.

The laws on the matter are succinct and clear and need no elaborate disquisition. Section 13 of the Local Tax Code provides:



"Sec. 13. Amusement tax on admission. -The province shall impose a 
tax on admission to be collected from the proprietors, lessees, or 
operators of theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses and other
 places of amusement xxx."
  




The foregoing provision of law in point indicates that the province 
can only impose a tax on admission from the proprietors, lessees, or 
operators of 
theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses
 
and other places of amusement. The authority to tax professional 
basketball games is not therein included, as the same is expressly 
embraced in PD 1959, which amended PD 1456 thus:



"SEC. 44. Section 268 of this Code, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows: 




âSec. 268. Amusement taxes. -- There shall be collected from the 
proprietor, lessee or operator of cockpits, cabarets, night or day 
clubs, boxing exhibitions, 
professional basketball games
, Jai-Alai, race tracks and bowling alleys, a tax equivalent to: 


â1. Eighteen 
per centum
 in the case of cockpits; 


â2. Eighteen 
per centum
 in the case of cabarets, night or day clubs; 


â3. Fifteen 
per centum
 in the case of boxing exhibitions; 


â4. Fifteen per centum in the case of professional basketball 
games as envisioned in Presidential Decree No. 871. Provided, however, 
That the tax herein shall be in lieu of all other percentage taxes of 
whatever nature and description;
 


â5. Thirty
 per centum
 in the case of Jai-Alai and race tracks; and 


â6. Fifteen 
per centum
 in the case of bowling alleys of 
their gross receipts, irrespective of whether or not any amount is 
charged or paid for admission. For the purpose of the amusement tax, the
 term gross receiptsâ embraces all the receipts of the proprietor, 
lessee or operator of the amusement place. Said gross receipts also 
include income from television, radio and motion picture rights, if any.
 (A person or entity or association conducting any activity subject to 
the tax herein imposed shall be similarly liable for said tax with 
respect to such portion of the receipts derived by him or it.) 


âThe taxes imposed herein shall be payable at the end of each 
quarter and it shall be the duty of the proprietor, lessee, or operator 
concerned, as well as any party liable, within twenty days after the end
 of each quarter, to make a true and complete return of the amount of 
the gross receipts derived during the preceding quarter and pay the tax 
due thereon. If the tax is not paid within the time prescribed above, 
the amount of the tax shall be increased by 
twenty-five per centum
, the increment to be part of the tax. 


âIn case of willful neglect to file the return within the period 
prescribed herein, or in case a false or fraudulent return is willfully 
made, there shall be added to the tax or to the deficiency tax, in case 
any payment has been made on the basis of the return before the 
discovery of the falsity or fraud, a surcharge of fifty 
per centum

 of its amount. The amount so added to any tax shall be collected at the
 same time and in the same manner and as part of the tax unless the tax 
has been paid before the discovery of the falsity or fraud, in which 
case, the amount so assessed shall be collected in the same manner as 
the tax." (underscoring ours) 






From the foregoing it is clear that the "proprietor, lessee or 
operator of xxx professional basketball games" is required to pay an 
amusement tax equivalent to fifteen per centum (15%) of their gross 
receipts to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, which payment is a national 
tax. The said payment of amusement tax is in lieu of all other 
percentage taxes of whatever nature and description.

While Section 13 of the Local Tax Code mentions "other places of 
amusement", professional basketball games are definitely not within its 
scope. Under the principle of 
ejusdem generis
, where general 
words follow an enumeration of persons or things, by words of a 
particular and specific meaning, such general words are not to be 
construed in their widest extent, but are to be held as applying only to
 persons or things of the same kind or class as those specifically 
mentioned.
[9]
 Thus, in 
determining the meaning of the phrase "other places of amusement", one 
must refer to the prior enumeration of theaters, cinematographs, concert
 halls and circuses with artistic expression as their common 
characteristic. Professional basketball games do not fall under the same
 category as theaters, cinematographs, concert halls and circuses as the
 latter basically belong to artistic forms of entertainment while the 
former caters to sports and gaming.

A historical analysis of pertinent laws does reveal the 
legislative intent to place professional basketball games within the 
ambit of a national tax. The Local Tax Code, which became effective on 
June 28, 1973, allowed the province to collect a tax on admission from 
the proprietors, lessees, or operators of 
theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement
.
 On January 6, 1976, the operation of petitioner was placed under the 
supervision and regulation of the Games and Amusement Board by virtue of
 PD 871, with the proviso (Section 8) that "xxx all professional 
basketball games conducted by the Philippine Basketball Association 
shall only be subject to amusement tax of five per cent of the gross 
receipts from the sale of admission tickets." Then, on June 11, 1978, PD
 1456 came into effect, increasing the amusement tax to ten per cent, 
with a categorical referral to PD 871, to wit, "[t]en per centum in the 
case of professional basketball games as envisioned in Presidential 
Decree No. 871 xxx." Later in 1984, PD 1959 increased the rate of 
amusement tax to fifteen percent by making reference also to PD 871. 
With the reference to PD 871 by PD 1456 and PD 1959, there is a 
recognition under the laws of this country that the amusement tax on 
professional basketball games is a national, and not a local, tax. Even 
up to the present, the category of amusement taxes on professional 
basketball games as a national tax remains the same. This is so provided
 under Section 125
[10]
 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code. Section 140
[11]

 of the Local Government Code of 1992 (Republic Act 7160), meanwhile, 
retained the areas (theaters, cinematographs, concert halls, circuses 
and other places of amusement) where the province may levy an amusement 
tax without including therein professional basketball games.

Likewise erroneous is the stance of petitioner that respondent Commissionerâs issuance of BIR Ruling No. 231-86
[12]
 and BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 8-88
[13]

 -- both upholding the authority of the local government to collect 
amusement taxes -- should bind the government or that, if there is any 
revocation or modification of said rule, the same should operate 
prospectively.

It bears stressing that the government can never be in estoppel, 
particularly in matters involving taxes. It is a well-known rule that 
erroneous application and enforcement of the law by public officers do 
not preclude subsequent correct application of the statute, and that the
 Government is never estopped by mistake or error on the part of its 
agents.
[14]


Untenable is the contention that income from the cession of 
streamer and advertising spaces to VEI is not subject to amusement tax. 
The questioned proviso may be found in Section 1 of PD 1456 which 
states:



"SECTION 1. Section 268 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 
1977, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows: 




âSec. 268. Amusement taxes. -- There shall be collected from the 
proprietor, lessee or operator of cockpits, cabarets, night or day 
clubs, boxing exhibitions, professional basketball games, Jai-Alai, race
 tracks and bowling alleys, a tax equivalent to: 


xxx  xxx  xxx 


of their gross receipts, irrespective of whether or not any amount is charged or paid for admission. 
For
 the purpose of the amusement tax, the term gross receiptsâ embraces all
 the receipts of the proprietor, lessee or operator of the amusement 
place
. Said gross receipts also include income from television, 
radio and motion picture rights, if any. (A person, or entity or 
association conducting any activity subject to the tax herein imposed 
shall be similarly liable for said tax with respect to such portion of 
the receipts derived by him or it.)" (underscoring ours) 






The foregoing definition of gross receipts is broad enough to embrace
 the cession of advertising and streamer spaces as the same embraces 
all

 the receipts of the proprietor, lessee or operator of the amusement 
place. The law being clear, there is no need for an extended 
interpretation.
[15]


The last issue for resolution concerns the liability of 
petitioner for the payment of surcharge and interest on the deficiency 
amount due. Petitioner contends that it is not liable, as it acted in 
good faith, having relied upon the issuances of the respondent 
Commissioner. This issue must necessarily fail as the same has never 
been posed as an issue before the respondent court. Issues not raised in
 the court a quo cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.
[16]


All things studiedly considered, the Court rules that the 
petitioner is liable to pay amusement tax to the national government, 
and not to the local government, in accordance with the rates prescribed
 by PD 1959.

WHEREFORE
, the Petition is DENIED, and the 
Decisions of the Court of Appeals and Court of Tax Appeals dated
