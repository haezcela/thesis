GONZAGA-REYES, J.:


In this petition for prohibition and mandamus filed on December 
9, 1999, petitioner Ramon A. Gonzales, in his capacity as a citizen and 
taxpayer, assails the constitutionality of the creation of the 
Preparatory Commission on Constitutional Reform (PCCR) and of the 
positions of presidential consultants, advisers and assistants. 
Petitioner asks this Court to enjoin the PCCR and the presidential 
consultants, advisers and assistants from acting as such, and to enjoin 
Executive Secretary Ronaldo B. Zamora from enforcing their advice and 
recommendations.  In addition, petitioner seeks to enjoin the Commission
 on Audit from passing in audit expenditures for the PCCR and the 
presidential consultants, advisers and assistants. Finally, petitioner 
prays for an order compelling respondent Zamora to furnish petitioner 
with information on certain matters.

On January 28, 2000, respondent Hon. Andres R. Narvasa, impleaded
 in his capacity as Chairman of the PCCR, filed his Comment to the 
Petition. The rest of the respondents, who are being represented in this
 case by the Solicitor General, filed their Comment with this Court on 
March 7, 2000.  Petitioner then filed a Consolidated Reply on April 24, 
2000, whereupon this case was considered submitted for decision.

I.  Preparatory Commission on Constitutional Reform



The Preparatory Commission on Constitutional Reform (PCCR) was 
created by President Estrada on November 26, 1998 by virtue of Executive
 Order No. 43 (E.O. No. 43) in order âto study and recommend proposed 
amendments and/or revisions to the 1987 Constitution, and the manner of 
implementing the same.â
[1]
 
Petitioner disputes the constitutionality of the PCCR on two grounds.  
First, he contends that it is a public office which only the legislature
 can create by way of a law.
[2]

 Secondly, petitioner asserts that by creating such a body the President
 is intervening in a process from which he is totally excluded by the 
Constitution â the amendment of the fundamental charter.
[3]


It is alleged by respondents that, with respect to the PCCR, this case has become moot and academic.  We agree.

An action is considered âmootâ when it no longer presents a 
justiciable controversy because the issues involved have become academic
 or dead.
[4]
 Under E.O. No. 43, the PCCR was instructed to complete its task on or before June 30, 1999.
[5]

 However, on February 19, 1999, the President issued Executive Order No.
 70 (E.O. No. 70), which extended the time frame for the completion of 
the commissionâs work, 
viz
 â



SECTION 6.  Section 8 is hereby amended to read as follows:
  


Time Frame.  The Commission shall commence its work on 01 January 
1999 and complete the same on or before 31 December 1999.  The 
Commission shall submit its report and recommendations to the President 
within fifteen (15) working days from 31 December 1999.
  




The PCCR submitted its recommendations to the President on December 
20, 1999 and was dissolved by the President on the same day.  It had 
likewise spent the funds allotted to it.
[6]
 Thus, the PCCR has ceased to exist, having lost its 
raison dâetre
. Subsequent events have overtaken the petition and the Court has nothing left to resolve.

The staleness of the issue before us is made more manifest by the
 impossibility of granting the relief prayed for by petitioner.  
Basically, petitioner asks this Court to enjoin the PCCR from acting as 
such.
[7]
 Clearly, prohibition 
is an inappropriate remedy since the body sought to be enjoined no 
longer exists.  It is well established that prohibition is a preventive 
remedy and does not lie to restrain an act that is already 
fait accompli
.
[8]

 At this point, any ruling regarding the PCCR would simply be in the 
nature of an advisory opinion, which is definitely beyond the 
permissible scope of judicial power.

In addition to the mootness of the issue, petitionerâs lack of 
standing constitutes another obstacle to the successful invocation of 
judicial power insofar as the PCCR is concerned.

The question in standing is whether a party has âalleged such a 
personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that 
concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon 
which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult 
constitutional questions.â
[9]
 In assailing the constitutionality of E.O. Nos. 43 and 70, petitioner asserts his interest as a citizen and taxpayer.
[10]

 A citizen acquires standing only if he can establish that he has 
suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the allegedly 
illegal conduct of the government; the injury is fairly traceable to the
 challenged action; and the injury is likely to be redressed by a 
favorable action.
[11]
 In 
Kilosbayan, Incorporated v. Morato
,
[12]

 we denied standing to petitioners who were assailing a lease agreement 
between the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office and the Philippine 
Gaming Management Corporation, stating that,



â¦ in 
Valmonte v. Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office
, 
G.R. No. 78716, Sept. 22, 1987, standing was denied to a petitioner who 
sought to declare a form of lottery known as Instant Sweepstakes invalid
 because, as the Court held, 




Valmonte brings the suit as a citizen, lawyer, taxpayer and 
father of three (3) minor children. But nowhere in his petition does 
petitioner claim that his rights and privileges as a lawyer or citizen 
have been directly and personally injured by the operation of the 
Instant Sweepstakes.  The interest of the person assailing the 
constitutionality of a statute must be direct and personal.  He must be 
able to show, not only that the law is invalid, but also that he has 
sustained or in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury as a 
result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers thereby in 
some indefinite way.  It must appear that the person complaining has 
been or is about to be denied some right or privilege to which he is 
lawfully entitled or that he is about to be subjected to some burdens or
 penalties by reason of the statute complained of.
    




We apprehend no difference between the petitioner in Valmonte and 
the present petitioners.  Petitioners do not in fact show what 
particularized interest they have for bringing this suit.  It does not 
detract from the high regard for petitioners as civic leaders to say 
that their interest falls short of that required to maintain an action 
under Rule 3, d 2.
  




Coming now to the instant case, petitioner has not shown that he has 
sustained or is in danger of sustaining any personal injury attributable
 to the creation of the PCCR.  If at all, it is only Congress, not 
petitioner, which can claim any âinjuryâ in this case since, according 
to petitioner, the President has encroached upon the legislatureâs 
powers to create a public office and to propose amendments to the 
Charter by forming the PCCR.  Petitioner has sustained no direct, or 
even any indirect, injury.  Neither does he claim that his rights or 
privileges have been or are in danger of being violated, nor that he 
shall be subjected to any penalties or burdens as a result of the PCCRâs
 activities.  Clearly, petitioner has failed to establish his 
locus standi
 so as to enable him to seek judicial redress as a citizen.

A taxpayer is deemed to have the standing to raise a 
constitutional issue when it is established that public funds have been 
disbursed in alleged contravention of the law or the Constitution.
[13]
, Thus payerâs action is properly brought only when there is an exercise by Congress of its taxing or spending power.
[14]

 This was our ruling in a recent case wherein petitioners 
Telecommunications and Broadcast Attorneys of the Philippines (TELEBAP) 
and GMA Network, Inc. questioned the validity of section 92 of B.P. No. 
881 (otherwise knows as the âOmnibus Election Codeâ) requiring radio and
 television stations to give free air time to the Commission on 
Elections during the campaign period.
[15]

 The Court held that petitioner TELEBAP did not have any interest as a 
taxpayer since the assailed law did not involve the taxing or spending 
power of Congress.
[16]


Many other rulings have premised the grant or denial of standing 
to taxpayers upon whether or not the case involved a disbursement of 
public funds by the legislature.  In 
Sanidad v. Commission on Elections
,
[17]

 the petitioners therein were allowed to bring a taxpayersâ suit to 
question several presidential decrees promulgated by then President 
Marcos in his legislative capacity calling for a national referendum, 
with the Court explaining that â 



...[i]t is now an ancient rule that the valid source of a statute â
 Presidential Decrees are of such nature â may be contested by one who 
will sustain a direct injury as a result of its enforcement.  At the 
instance of taxpayers, laws providing for the disbursement of public 
funds may be enjoined, upon the theory that the expenditure of public 
funds by an officer of the State for the purpose of executing an 
unconstitutional act constitutes a misapplication of such funds.  The 
breadth of Presidential Decree No. 991 carries an appropriation of Five 
Million Pesos for the effective implementation of its purposes. 
Presidential Decree No. 1031 appropriates the sum of Eight Million Pesos
 to carry out its provisions.  The interest of the aforenamed 
petitioners as taxpayers in the lawful expenditure of these amounts of 
public money sufficiently clothes them with that personality to litigate
 the validity of the Decrees appropriating said funds. â¦
  




In still another case, the Court held that petitioners â the 
Philippine Constitution Association, Inc., a non-profit civic 
organization - had standing as taxpayers to question the 
constitutionality of Republic Act No. 3836 insofar as it provides for 
retirement gratuity and commutation of vacation and sick leaves to 
Senators and Representatives and to the elective officials of both 
houses of Congress.
[18]
 And in 
Pascual v. Secretary of Public Works
,
[19]

 the Court allowed petitioner to maintain a taxpayerâs suit assailing 
the constitutional soundness of Republic Act No. 920 appropriating 
P85,000 for the construction, repair and improvement of feeder roads 
within private property.  All these cases involved the disbursement of 
public funds by means of a law.

Meanwhile, in 
Bugnay Construction and Development Corporation v. Laron
,
[20]

 the Court declared that the trial court was wrong in allowing 
respondent Ravanzo to bring an action for injunction in his capacity as a
 taxpayer in order to question the legality of the contract of lease 
covering the public market entered into between the City of Dagupan and 
petitioner.  The Court declared that Ravanzo did not possess the 
requisite standing to bring such taxpayerâs suit since â[o]n its face, 
and there is no evidence to the contrary, the lease contract entered 
into between petitioner and the City shows that no public funds have 
been or will be used in the construction of the market building.â

Coming now to the instant case, it is readily apparent that there
 is no exercise by Congress of its taxing or spending power.  The PCCR 
was created by the President by virtue of E.O. No. 43, as amended by 
E.O. No. 70. Under section 7 of E.O. No. 43, the amount of P3 million is
 âappropriatedâ for its operational expenses âto be sourced from the 
funds of the Office of the President.â The relevant provision states -



Appropriations.  The initial amount of Three Million Pesos 
(P3,000,000.00) is hereby appropriated for the operational expenses of 
the Commission to be sourced from funds of the Office of the President, 
subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations.  
Additional amounts shall be released to the Commission upon submission 
of requirements for expenditures.
  




The appropriations for the PCCR were authorized by the President, not
 by Congress.  In fact, there was no an appropriation at all. âIn a 
strict sense, 
appropriation
 has been defined âas nothing more 
than the legislative authorization prescribed by the Constitution that 
money may be paid out of the Treasuryâ, while 
appropriation made by law

 refers to âthe act of the legislature setting apart or assigning to a 
particular use a certain sum to be used in the payment of debt or dues 
from the State to its creditors.â â
[21]

 The funds used for the PCCR were taken from funds intended for the 
Office of the President, in the exercise of the Chief Executiveâs power 
to transfer funds pursuant to section 25 (5) of article VI of the 
Constitution.

In the final analysis, it must be stressed that the Court retains
 the power to decide whether or not it will entertain a taxpayerâs suit.
[22]

 In the case at bar, there being no exercise by Congress of its taxing 
or spending power, petitioner cannot be allowed to question the creation
 of the PCCR in his capacity as a taxpayer, but rather, he must 
establish that he has a âpersonal and substantial interest in the case 
and that he has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of 
its enforcement.â
[23]
 In other
 words, petitioner must show that he is a real party in interest - that 
he will stand to be benefited or injured by the judgment or that he will
 be entitled to the avails of the suit.
[24]
 Nowhere in his pleadings does petitioner presume to make such a representation.

II. Presidential Consultants, Advisers, Assistants



The second issue raised by petitioner concerns the presidential 
consultants. Petitioner alleges that in 1995 and 1996, the President 
created seventy (70) positions in the Office of the President and 
appointed to said positions twenty (20) presidential consultants, 
twenty-two (22) presidential advisers, and twenty-eight (28) 
presidential assistants.
[25]
 Petitioner asserts that, as in the case of the PCCR, the President does not have the power to create these positions.
[26]


Consistent with the abovementioned discussion on standing, 
petitioner does not have the personality to raise this issue before the 
Court. First of all, he has not proven that he has sustained or is in 
danger of sustaining any injury as a result of the appointment of such 
presidential advisers.  Secondly, petitioner has not alleged the 
necessary facts so as to enable the Court to determine if he possesses a
 taxpayerâs interest in this particular issue.  Unlike the PCCR which 
was created by virtue of an executive order, petitioner does not allege 
by what official act, whether it be by means of an executive order, 
administrative order, memorandum order, or otherwise, the President 
attempted to âcreateâ the positions of presidential advisers, 
consultants and assistants.  Thus, it is unclear what act of the 
President petitioner is assailing.  In support of his allegation, 
petitioner merely annexed a copy of the Philippine Government Directory 
(Annex âCâ) listing the names and positions of such presidential 
consultants, advisers and assistants to his petition.  However, 
appointment is obviously not synonymous with creation.  It would be 
improvident for this Court to entertain this issue given the 
insufficient nature of the allegations in the Petition.

III.  Right to Information



Finally, petitioner asks us to issue a writ of mandamus ordering 
Executive Secretary Ronaldo B. Zamora to answer his letter (Annex âDâ) 
dated October 4, 1999 requesting for the names of executive officials 
holding multiple positions in government, copies of their appointments, 
and a list of the recipients of luxury vehicles seized by the Bureau of 
Customs and turned over to Malacanang.
[27]


The right to information is enshrined in Section 7 of the Bill of Rights which provides that â



The right of the people to information on matters of public concern
 shall be recognized.  Access to official records, and to documents, and
 papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well
 as to government research data used as basis for policy development, 
shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be 
provided by law.
  




Under both the 1973
[28]
 and
 1987 Constitution, this is a self-executory provision which can be 
invoked by any citizen before the courts.  This was our ruling in 
Legaspi v. Civil Service Commission
,
[29]

 wherein the Court classified the right to information as a public right
 and âwhen a [m]andamus proceeding involves the assertion of a public 
right, the requirement of personal interest is satisfied by the mere 
fact that the petitioner is a citizen, and therefore, part of the 
general âpublicâ which possesses the right.â However, Congress may 
provide for reasonable conditions upon the access to information.  Such 
limitations were embodied in Republic Act No. 6713, otherwise knows as 
the âCode of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and 
Employees,â which took effect on March 25, 1989.  This law provides 
that, in the performance of their duties, all public officials and 
employees are obliged to respond to letters sent by the public within 
fifteen (15) working days from receipt thereof and to ensure the 
accessibility of all public documents for inspection by the public 
within reasonable working hours, subject to the reasonable claims of 
confidentiality.
[30]


Elaborating on the significance of the right to information, the Court said in 
Baldoza v. Dimaano
[31]

 that â[t]he incorporation of this right in the Constitution is a 
recognition of the fundamental role of free exchange of information in a
 democracy.  There can be no realistic perception by the public of the 
nationâs problems, nor a meaningful democratic decisionmaking if they 
are denied access to information of general interest.  Information is 
needed to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of 
the times.â The information to which the public is entitled to are those
 concerning âmatters of public concernâ, a term which âembrace[s] a 
broad spectrum of  subjects which the public may want to know, either 
because these directly affect their lives, or simply because such 
matters naturally arouse the interest of an ordinary citizen.  In the 
final analysis, it is for the courts to determine in a case by case 
basis whether the matter at issue is of interest or importance, as it 
relates to or affects the public.â
[32]


Thus, we agree with petitioner that respondent Zamora, in his 
official capacity as Executive Secretary, has a constitutional and 
statutory duty to answer petitionerâs letter dealing with matters which 
are unquestionably of public concern â that is, appointments made to 
public offices and the utilization of public property.  With regard to 
petitionerâs request for copies of the appointment papers of certain 
officials, respondent Zamora is obliged to allow the inspection and 
copying of the same subject to the reasonable limitations required for 
the orderly conduct of official business.
[33]


WHEREFORE
, the petition is dismissed, with the 
exception that respondent Zamora is ordered to furnish petitioner with 
the information requested.

SO ORDERED.
