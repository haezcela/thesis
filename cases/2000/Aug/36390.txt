POTENCIANA M. EVANGELISTA, PETITIONER, VS. THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN, (FIRST DIVISION), RESPONDENTS.

YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


On September 30, 1999, we rendered a Decision in this case 
acquitting petitioner of the charge of violation of then Section 268 (4)
 of the National Internal Revenue Code
[1]
 but affirming her conviction for violation of Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3 (e),
[2]

 thus imposing on her an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for six 
(6) years and one month as minimum to twelve (12) years as maximum, and 
the penalty of perpetual disqualification from public office.

The basic facts are briefly restated as follows:

On September 17, 1987, Tanduay Distillery, Inc. filed with the 
Bureau of Internal Revenue an application for tax credit in the amount 
of P180,701,682.00, for allegedly erroneous payments of ad valorem taxes
 from January 1, 1986 to August 31, 1987. Tanduay claimed that it is a 
rectifier of alcohol and other spirits, which per previous ruling of the
 BIR is only liable to pay specific taxes and not ad valorem taxes. Upon
 receipt of the application, Aquilino Larin of the Specific Tax Office 
sent a memorandum to the Revenue Accounting Division (RAD), headed by 
petitioner, requesting the said office to check and verify whether the 
amounts claimed by Tanduay were actually paid to the BIR as ad valorem 
taxes. Larinâs memorandum was received by the Revenue Administrative 
Section (RAS), a subordinate office of the RAD. After making the 
necessary verification, the RAS prepared a certification in the form of a
 1st Indorsement to the Specific Tax Office, dated September 25, 1987, 
which was signed by petitioner as RAD chief.

The 1st Indorsement states that Tanduay made tax payments 
classified under Tax Numeric Code (TNC) 3011-0001 totalling 
P102,519,100.00 and payments classified under TNC 0000-0000 totalling 
P78,182,582.00. Meanwhile, Teodoro PareÃ±o, head of the Tax and Alcohol 
Division, certified to Justino Galban, Jr., Head of the Compounders, 
Rectifiers and Repackers Section, that Tanduay was a rectifier not 
liable for ad valorem tax. PareÃ±o recommended to Larin that the 
application for tax credit be given due course. Hence, Larin recommended
 that Tanduayâs claim be approved, on the basis of which Deputy 
Commissioner Eufracio D. Santos signed Tax Credit Memo No. 5177 in the 
amount of P180,701,682.00.

Sometime thereafter, a certain Ruperto Lim wrote a 
letter-complaint to then BIR Commissioner Bienvenido Tan, Jr. alleging 
that the grant of Tax Credit Memo No. 5177 was irregular and anomalous. 
Based on this, Larin, PareÃ±o, Galban and petitioner Evangelista were 
charged before the Sandiganbayan with violation of Section 268 (4) of 
the National Internal Revenue Code and of Section 3 (e) of R.A. 3019, 
the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Larin, PareÃ±o and petitioner 
were later convicted of both crimes, while Galban was acquitted inasmuch
 as his only participation in the processing of Tanduayâs application 
was the preparation of the memorandum confirming that Tanduay was a 
rectifier.

The three accused filed separate petitions for review. PareÃ±oâs 
and Larinâs petitions were consolidated and, in a decision dated April 
17, 1996, both were acquitted by this Court in Criminal Cases Nos. 14208
 and 14209.
[3]
 In this 
petition, on the other hand, we acquitted petitioner in Criminal Case 
No. 14208, for violation of Section 268 (4) of the NIRC. However, we 
found petitioner guilty of gross negligence in issuing a certification 
containing TNCs which she did not know the meaning of and which, in 
turn, became the basis of the Bureauâs grant of Tanduayâs application 
for tax credit. Thus, we affirmed petitionerâs conviction in Criminal 
Case No. 14209, i.e., for violation of Section 3 (e) of the Anti-Graft 
and Corrupt Practices Act.

Petitioner seasonably filed a Motion for Reconsideration,
[4]

 wherein she asserts that there was nothing false in her certification 
inasmuch as she did not endorse therein approval of the application for 
tax credit. Rather, her certification showed the contrary, namely, that 
Tanduay was not entitled to the tax credit since there was no proof that
 it paid ad valorem taxes. Petitioner also claims that she was neither 
afforded due process nor informed of the nature and cause of the 
accusation against her. She was found guilty of an offense different 
from that alleged in the information; consequently, she was unable to 
properly defend herself from the crime for which she was convicted.

The Information against petitioner and her co-accused in Criminal
 Case No. 14209 alleges in fine that they caused undue injury to the 
Government and gave unwarranted benefits to Tanduay when they endorsed 
approval of the claim for tax credit by preparing, signing and 
submitting false memoranda, certification and/or official communications
 stating that Tanduay paid ad valorem taxes when it was not liable for 
such because its products are distilled spirits on which specific taxes 
are paid, by reason of which false memoranda, certification and/or 
official communications the BIR approved the application for tax credit,
 thus defrauding the Government of the sum of P107,087,394.80, 
representing the difference between the amount claimed as tax credit and
 the amount of ad valorem taxes paid by Tanduay to the BIR.
[5]

 According to petitioner, instead of convicting her of the acts 
described in the Information, she was convicted of issuing the 
certification without identifying the kinds of tax for which the TNCs 
stand and without indicating whether Tanduay was really entitled to tax 
credit or not.

The Solicitor General filed his Comment
[6]

 wherein he joined petitionerâs cause and prayed that the motion for 
reconsideration be granted. In hindsight, even the Solicitor Generalâs 
comment on the petition consisted of a "Manifestation and Motion in lieu
 of Comment,"
[7]
 where he recommended that petitioner be acquitted of the two charges against her.

We find that the Motion for Reconsideration is well-taken.

After a careful re-examination of the records of this case, it 
would appear that the certification made by petitioner in her 1st 
Indorsement was not favorable to Tanduayâs application for tax credit. 
Far from it, petitionerâs certification meant that there were no 
payments of ad valorem taxes by Tanduay in the records and hence, it was
 not entitled to tax credit. In other words, the certification was 
against the grant of Tanduayâs application for tax credit.

It has been established that the BIR adopted tax numeric codes 
(TNCs) to classify taxes according to their kinds and rates, in order to
 facilitate the preparation of statistical and other management reports,
 the improvement of revenue accounting and the production of tax data 
essential to management planning and decision-making. These codes 
include TNC No. 3011-0001 for specific tax on domestic distilled 
spirits, TNC No. 3023-2001 for ad valorem tax on compounded liquors, and
 TNC No. 0000-0000 for unclassified taxes.

Petitionerâs 1st Indorsement dated September 25, 1987 lists down 
the confirmation receipts covering tax payments by Tanduay for the 
period January 1, 1986 to August 31, 1987, during which Tanduay alleges 
that it made erroneous ad valorem tax payments, classified according to 
TNC numbers. The tax payments therein are described only as falling 
under TNC No. 3011-0001, i.e., specific tax, and TNC No. 0000-0000, 
i.e., unclassified taxes. There are no tax payments classified as 
falling under TNC No. 3023-2001, the code for ad valorem taxes. The 
import of this, simply, is that Tanduay did not make any ad valorem tax 
payments during the said period and is, therefore, not entitled to any 
tax credit.

Further, petitioner contends that she was convicted of a supposed crime not punishable by law.
[8]

 She was charged with violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. 
3019, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, which states:



SEC. 3. 
Corrupt practices of public officers
. --- In 
addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by 
existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any 
public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:
  


xxx xxx xx.
  


(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the 
Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, 
advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, judicial or 
administrative functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith 
or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers 
and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the 
grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.
  


xxx xxx xxx.
  




The elements of the offense are: (1) that the accused are public 
officers or private persons charged in conspiracy with them; (2) that 
said public officers commit the prohibited acts during the performance 
of their official duties or in relation to their public positions; (3) 
that they cause undue injury to any party, whether the Government or a 
private party; (4) that such injury is caused by giving unwarranted 
benefits, advantage or preference to such parties; and (5) that the 
public officers have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith 
or gross inexcusable negligence.
[9]


R.A. 3019, Section 3, paragraph (e), as amended, provides as one 
of its elements that the public officer should have acted by causing any
 undue injury to any party, including the Government, or by giving any 
private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the 
discharge of his functions. The use of the disjunctive term "or" 
connotes that either act qualifies as a violation of Section 3, 
paragraph (e), or as aptly held in Santiago,
[10]

 as two (2) different modes of committing the offense. This does not 
however indicate that each mode constitutes a distinct offense, but 
rather, that an accused may be charged under either mode or under both.
[11]


In the instant case, we find that petitioner, in issuing the 
certification, did not cause any undue injury to the Government. She 
also did not give unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to 
Tanduay. Neither did petitioner display manifest partiality to Tanduay 
nor act with evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. Quite 
the contrary, petitionerâs certification was against the interest of 
Tanduay. It did not advocate the grant of its application for tax 
credit. The certification can even be read as a recommendation of denial
 of the application.

Petitioner further argues that her conviction was merely based on
 her alleged failure to identify with certainty in her certification the
 kinds of taxes paid by Tanduay and to indicate what the TNCs stand for,
 which acts were different from those described in the Information under
 which she was charged. This, she claims, violated her constitutional 
right to due process and to be informed of the nature and cause of the 
accusation against her.

It is well-settled that an accused cannot be convicted of an 
offense unless it is clearly charged in the complaint or information. 
Constitutionally, he has a right to be informed of the nature and cause 
of the accusation against him. To convict him of an offense other than 
that charged in the complaint or information would be a violation of 
this constitutional right.
[12]

 In the case at bar, we find merit in petitionerâs contention that the 
acts for which she was convicted are different from those alleged in the
 Information. More importantly, as we have discussed above, petitionerâs
 act of issuing the certification did not constitute corrupt practices 
as defined in Section 3 (e) of R.A. 3019.

Employees of the BIR were expected to know what the TNCs stand 
for. If they do not, there is a "Handbook of Tax Numeric Code of Revenue
 Sources" which they can consult. With this, petitioner should not be 
required to describe in words the kinds of tax for which each TNC used 
stands for. Precisely, the purpose of introducing the use of tax numeric
 codes in the Bureau was to do away with these descriptive words, in 
order to expedite and facilitate communications among the different 
divisions therein. We find that petitionerâs omission to indicate what 
kind of taxes TNC Nos. 3011-0001 and 0000-0000 stand for was not a 
criminal act. Applicable here is the familiar maxim in criminal law: 
Nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege
. There is no crime where there is no law punishing it.

On the whole, therefore, we find that petitioner was not guilty 
of any criminal offense. The prosecutionâs evidence failed to establish 
that petitioner committed the acts described in the Information which 
constitute corrupt practices. Her conviction must, therefore, be set 
aside. For conviction must rest no less than on hard evidence showing 
that the accused, with moral certainty, is guilty of the crime charged. 
Short of these constitutional mandate and statutory safeguard --- that a
 person is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved --- the Court 
is then left without discretion and is duty bound to render a judgment 
of acquittal.
[13]


WHEREFORE
, the Motion for Reconsideration is 
GRANTED. This Courtâs Decision dated September 30, 1999 is RECONSIDERED 
and SET ASIDE. Petitioner is ACQUITTED of the charge against her.

SO ORDERED.
