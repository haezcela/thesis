REMEDIOS F. EDRIAL, MAURO EDRIAL JR., MARYLENE EDRIAL, ILDEFONSO EDRIAL, ROSALIND EDRIAL, MARY JEAN EDRIAL, AND SUSAN EDRIAL-VALENZUELA, PETITIONERS, VS. PEDRO QUILAT-QUILAT, GABRIELA QUILAT-QUILAT, ISIDRA QUILAT-QUILAT, AND ESTANISLAO QUILAT-QUILAT, RESPONDENTS.
DECISION




PANGANIBAN, J.:


Parties who prayed for and were granted several postponements and caused repeated delays cannot ask for the reopening of the trial for the purpose of presenting additional evidence. After squandering several opportunities given them to ventilate their claims, they can no longer complain of alleged violation of their right to due process.
The Case
Before us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari, assailing the October 17, 1997 Decision
[1]
  and the March 19, 1998 Resolution
[2]
  of the Court of Appeals (CA)
[3]
  in CA-GR SP No. 42660. The CA affirmed the Order of the trial court, which had denied their Motion to Reopen the Case and to allow them to complete the presentation of their evidence. The assailed Decision disposed as follows:
[4]
"WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED."
The Resolution denied reconsideration of the challenged Decision.
The Facts
Respondents Pedro, Gabriela, Isidra and Estanislao - all surnamed Quilat-Quilat -- filed an action for recovery of a parcel of land against Petitioners Remedios, Mauro Jr., Marylene, Idelfonso, Rosalind, Mary Jean -- all surnamed Edrial -- and Susan Edrial-Valenzuela. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 6315 and raffled to Branch 39 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dumaguete City.
[5]
  The Court of Appeals presented the facts of this case as follows:
"Atty. Gerardo Lituanas, a lawyer of the LAPIL (IBP) Negros Oriental, who was also an [e]lection [r]egistrar of the COMELEC, filed the complaint in 1975;
Atty. Lituanas was able to present evidence on the following dates:
July 10, 1981
First plaintiffs' witness Atilano Ramirez, 73 years old, was presented;
July 16, 1981
Continuation of the testimony of Atilano Ramirez;
August 24, 1982
Continuation of the testimony of Atilano Ramirez;
November 20, 1984
Continuation of the testimony of Atilano Ramirez;
February 28, 1984
Direct Examination of 2nd Plaintiffs' witness Ignacio Tomias. Cross-examination was waived.
August 21, 1985
Plaintiff Pedro Quilat-Quilat was presented on direct examination.
"On December 16, 1986, the Citizen Legal Assistance Office (CLAO) entered its appearance as new [private respondents'] counsel after Atty. Gerardo Lituanas has filed his withdrawal. The subsequent events are as follows:
February 23, 1987
The case was set for hearing on April 21, 1987.
April 21, 1987
The hearing was reset due to the projected amendment of the complainant to implead Primitiva Torrecampo.

The third amended complaint was admitted.
September 9, 1987
Hearing was postponed at the instance of the defendants [herein petitioners].
October 22, 1987
The hearing was suspended for the reason that the Court would require the [private respondents] to submit a certification from the Bureau of Forest Development that the land involved in this case [was] not a part of the public forest.
December 17, 1987
The hearing was postponed at the request of [private respondents'] counsel for the reason that she [would] be attending [a] conference in Cebu City.

December 11, 1990
Atty. Eleccion did not appear. The case [was] submitted for decision as of th[at] day.
August 21, 1992
The transcript of stenographic notes which was taken down by stenographer Alexander Yberley, was missing. He was ordered to produce the transcript.
October 30, 1992
Witness Atilano Ramirez was recalled for cross-examination since stenographer Yberley manifested that the record was burned. Despite due notice, nobody appeared for the [petitioners]. So as of this day, the cross-examination of Atilano Ramirez was considered waived and the case was finally submitted for decision.
December 11, 1992
Court granted the prayer of Atty. Sedillo and the case [was] set for hearing on March 22, 29 and April 5 1993.
March 22, 1993
Atty. Sedillo did not present evidence but instead moved for a resetting of the hearing to April 12, 1993. He [was] advised by the Court to be prepared on the next scheduled hearing.

Judge [was] on leave. Hearing [was] reset to October 3, 1994.
October 3, 1994
The hearing [was] reset to November 17, 1994 due to non-availability of [petitioners'] witness Atty. Roque Bonganciso who [was] on recall.
November 17, 1994
There [was] talk about [a] proposed settlement, hearing [was] held in abeyance.
January 6, 1995
Since no settlement [was] realized a [private respondents'] motion to set [the] case for hearing was filed and the case was reset to [February] 27, 1995.
February 27, 1995
Earlier, [petitioners'] counsel, Atty. Sedillo filed a motion for postponement as he [would be] appearing in a case in Manila. Atty. Ybanez manifested that on February 26, 1995 Atty. Sedillo was in Dumaguete and further that this case ha[d] been delayed by the failure of the [petitioners] to complete the presentation of their evidence. The Court then ordered the case submitted for decision for the THIRD TIME.
March 16, 1995
The Court issued an order reconsidering the February 27, 1995 order upon motion of Atty. Sedillo and set the case for the [petitioners] for June 16, 1995 with a STERN WARNING TO THE [PETITIONERS].

Ruling of the Court of Appeals
The CA dismissed petitioners' appeal because, in issuing the questioned Orders, the trial judge committed no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction. In giving petitioners more than ample time to complete their presentation of evidence and in granting their Motions for Postponement, the judge was accommodating them more than they actually deserved.
Hence, this Petition.
[7]
Issues
Petitioners submit that the CA erred in affirming the twin Orders of the Dumaguete City RTC, Branch 39. They contend that a reversal thereof would have allowed them to complete their presentation of evidence. Hence, by affirming those Orders, the CA allegedly violated their right to due process.
[8]
This Court's Ruling
The Petition is without merit.
Main Issue
Due Process and Reopening of Trial
Counsel for petitioners alleges that the addresses of his clients on file in his law firm were incorrect; hence, the notices and other forms of communication he had sent to them were not received. He allegedly discovered this fact only after he had filed his withdrawal as their counsel. He also argues that the denial of the Motion to Reopen Trial was "plainly capricious and oppressive" because private respondents were equally guilty of delay and procrastination. Finally, he maintains that allowing petitioners to present their remaining evidence would be "in the interest of substantial due process and humane justice."
Respondents disagree, reasoning that the trial court thrice reconsidered its Order to submit the case for decision; that is, petitioners were given several opportunities to present their evidence, but they squandered them. Petitioners, they further point out, were intentionally seeking to delay the resolution of the case because they were in physical possession of the land in dispute.
Counsel's excuses are unsatisfactory and unacceptable. The CA ruled that petitioners were given "more than enough time" to complete their presentation of evidence. Respondents rested their case as early as September 1992. Petitioners' lawyer, at his own request, was allowed to start presenting evidence only on April 12, 1993. From that day until April 26, 1996 or for a period of three years, counsel presented only two witnesses. The trial judge was in fact liberal in granting petitioners' Motions for Postponement. But enough was enough; when they attempted to delay the trial some more, the trial judge finally and correctly refused to go along.
True, respondents also asked for continuances, but petitioners were ultimately to blame for the inexcusable delay. The case was submitted for decision three times -- on December 11, 1990, October 30, 1992, and February 27, 1995 - but petitioners and/or their counsel did not appear in court each time. After having failed to take advantage of opportunities to ventilate their claims below, parties may no longer be accorded the same chances, in the absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, as in this case.
[9]
The Court frowns on lawyers' practice of repeatedly seeking extensions of time to file pleadings and thereafter simply letting the period lapse without submitting any pleading or even any explanation or manifestation of their failure.
[10]
  The same principle applies more forcefully to motions for continuance. Postponement is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion. Actions thereon will not be disturbed by appellate courts in the absence of a clear or manifest abuse of discretion, resulting in a denial of substantial justice.
[11]
  We concur with the CA that there is no such denial in this case.
It is highly suspicious how the counsel for petitioners continued to represent his clients effectively for several years despite allegedly having lost their correct addresses. It was definitely his duty to know the correct ones. Indeed, it was too late for him to do so after he had withdrawn as their counsel. According to him, after April 16, 1996, he sent an office employee to verify the whereabouts of Mauro Edrial Jr. The inquiry yielded the information that Mauro actually resided in San Jose, Negros Oriental, and that Susan Edrial Valenzuela resided in Gomez St., Dumaguete City.
[12]
  He should have undertaken the search before withdrawing as counsel. Further, notice might not have been received by petitioners themselves, but that did not excuse counsel's failure to appear during trials.
Counsel for petitioners further avers that he had difficulty in presenting Atty. Roque Bonganciso because of the latter's prior commitments which conflicted with the scheduled trial dates. The last witness was Mauro Edrial Jr., but counsel had the wrong address on file. He should just have adjusted the order of presentation of witnesses and called Edrial Jr. later. Such move could have prevented the postponement. Besides, finding an available date in his calendar would not have taken Atty. Bonganciso three years.
The Code of Professional Responsibility requires that lawyers, after obtaining extensions of time to file pleadings, memoranda or briefs, shall not let the period lapse without submitting the same or offering an explanation for their failure to do so (Rule 12.03).
[13]
  Moreover, they should avoid any action that would unduly delay a case, impede the execution of a judgment or misuse court processes (Rule 12.04).
For the benefit of the bench and bar, worth repeating is the CA's reminder to petitioners' counsel of his duty to his client and to the court:
"Being an officer of the court a lawyer is part of the machinery in the administration of justice. Like the court itself, he is an instrument to advance its ends-the speedy, efficient, impartial, correct and inexpensive adjudication of cases and the prompt satisfaction of final judgments. A lawyer should not only help attain these objectives but should likewise avoid any unethical or improper practices that impede, obstruct or prevent their realization, charged as he is with the primary task of assisting in the speedy and efficient administration of justice."
