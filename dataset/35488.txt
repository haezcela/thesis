Statement of the Case
Before us is a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking a reversal of the Decision
[1]
  of the Court of Appeals
[2]
  promulgated on January 31, 1995 in CA-G.R. SP No. 34158, which modified the Decision dated February 18, 1994 of the Regional Trial Court
[3]
  of Virac, Catanduanes, Branch 42, in Sp. Civil Case No. 1654.
The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision of the appellate court reads:
â
WHEREFORE
, the judgment appealed from is hereby 
MODIFIED
 such that paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 thereof are deleted. Paragraph 3 is 
AFFIRMED
. No pronouncement as to costs.â
[4]
Antecedent Facts
Private Respondent Augusto T. Antonio was elected barangay captain of Sapang Palay, San Andres, Catanduanes in March 1989. He was later elected president of the Association of Barangay Councils (ABC)
[5]
  for the Municipality of San Andres, Catanduanes. In that capacity and pursuant to the Local Government Code of 1983, he was appointed by the President as member of the 
Sangguniang Bayan
 of the Municipality of San Andres.
Meanwhile, then Secretary Luis T. Santos of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) declared the election for the president of the Federation of the Association of Barangay Councils (FABC) of the same province, in which private respondent was a voting member, void for want of a quorum. Hence, a reorganization of the provincial council became necessary. Conformably, the DILG secretary designated private respondent as a temporary member of the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 of the Province of Catanduanes, effective June 15, 1990.
In view of his designation, private respondent resigned as a member of the 
Sangguniang Bayan
. He tendered his resignation
[6]
  dated June 14, 1990 to Mayor Lydia T. Romano of San Andres, Catanduanes, with copies furnished to the provincial governor, the DILG and the municipal treasurer. Pursuant to Section 50 of the 1983 Local Government Code
[7]
  (B.P. Blg. 337), Nenito F. Aquino, then vice-president of the ABC, was subsequently appointed by the provincial governor as member of the Sangguniang Bayan
[8]
  in place of private respondent. Aquino assumed office on July 18, 1990 after taking his oath.
[9]
 
Subsequently, the ruling of DILG Secretary Santos annulling the election of the FABC president was reversed by the Supreme Court in 
Taule vs. Santos.
[10]
  In the same case, the appointment of Private Respondent Antonio as sectoral representative to the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 was declared void, because he did not possess the basic qualification that he should be president of the federation of barangay councils.
[11]
  This ruling of the Court became final and executory on December 9, 1991.
On March 31, 1992, private respondent wrote to the members of the 
Sangguniang Bayan
 of San Andres advising them of his re-assumption of his âoriginal position, duties and responsibilities as sectoral representativeâ
[12]
  therein. In response thereto, the 
Sanggunian
 issued Resolution No. 6, Series of 1992, declaring that Antonio had no legal basis to resume office as a member of the Sangguniang Bayan.
[13]
 
On August 13, 1992, private respondent sought from the DILG a definite ruling relative to his right to resume his office as member of the 
Sangguniang Bayan
.
[14]
  Director Jacob F. Montesa, department legal counsel of the DILG, clarified Antonioâs status in this wise:
âHaving been elected President of the ABC in accordance with the Departmentâs Memorandum Circular No. 89-09,
[15]
  you became an ex-officio member in the sanggunian. Such position has not been vacated inasmuch as you did not resign nor abandon said office when you were designated as temporary representative of the Federation to the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 of Catanduanes on June 7, 1990. The Supreme Court in Triste vs. Leyte State College Board of Trustees (192 SCRA 327), declared that: âdesignation implies temporariness. Thus, to âdesignateâ a public officer to another position may mean to vest him with additional duties while he performs the functions of his permanent office. In some cases, a public officer may be âdesignatedâ to a position in an acting capacity as when an undersecretary is designated to discharge the functions of the Secretary pending the appointment of a permanent Secretary.â
Furthermore, incumbent ABC presidents are mandated by the Rules and Regulations Implementing the 1991 Local Government Code to continue to act as president of the association and to serve as ex-officio members of the 
sangguniang bayan,
 to wit:
Article 210 (d) (3), Rule XXIX of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Rep. Act No. 7160, provides that:
âThe incumbent presidents of the municipal, city and provincial chapters of the
 liga
 shall continue to serve as ex-officio members of the sanggunian concerned until the expiration of their term of office, unless sooner removed for cause.â
â(f) x x x Pending election of the presidents of the municipal, city, provincial and metropolitan chapters of the 
liga,
 the incumbent presidents of the association of barangay councils in the municipality, city, province and Metropolitan Manila, shall continue to act as president of the corresponding liga chapters under this Rule.â
In view of the foregoing, considering that the annuled designation is only an additional duty to your primary function, which is the ABC President, we find no legal obstacle if you re-assume your representation in the 
sanggunian bayan
 as ex-officio member.â
[16]
 
Despite this clarification, the local legislative body issued another resolution
[17]
  reiterating its previous stand.
In response to private respondentâs request,
[18]
  Director Montesa opined that Antonio did not relinquish or abandon his office; and that since he was the duly elected ABC president, he could re-assume his position in the 
Sanggunian
.
[19]
  A copy of said reply was sent to the members of the local legislative body.
Notwithstanding, the 
Sanggunian
 refused to acknowledge the right of private respondent to re-assume office as sectoral representative.
On December 10, 1992, private respondent filed a petition for certiorari and mandamus with preliminary mandatory injunction and/or restraining order before the RTC. On February 18, 1994, the trial court rendered its decision holding that Augusto T. Antonioâs resignation from the 
Sangguniang Bayan
 was ineffective and inoperative, since there was no acceptance thereof by the proper authorities. The decretal portion of the decision reads:
 
 
â
WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the petitioner and against the respondents and ordering the latter:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1)
 
 
to pay the petitioner jointly and severally the amount of P10,000.00 as attorneyâs fees and the cost of the suit;
 
 
 
(2)
 
 
to allow petitioner to assume his position as sectoral representative of the Sangguniang Bayan of San Andres, Catanduanes;
 
 
 
(3)
 
 
to pay the petitioner jointly and severally his uncollected salaries similar to those received by the other members of the Sangguniang Bayan of San Andres, Catanduanes as certified to by the Municipal Budget Officer and Municipal Treasurer of the same municipality from April 8, 1992 up to the date of this judgment; and
 
 
 
(4)
 
 
declaring Resolution No[s]. 7 & 28 series of 1992 null and void and to have no effect.â
[20]
 
 
 
Petitioners appealed this judgment to the Court of Appeals.
Appellate Courtâs Ruling
Respondent Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courtâs ruling but deleted the first, second and fourth paragraphs of its dispositive portion. It held that private respondentâs resignation was not accepted by the proper authority, who is the President of the Philippines. While the old Local Government Code is silent as to who should accept and act on the resignation of any member of the Sanggunian, the law vests in the President the power to appoint members of the local legislative unit. Thus, resignations must be addressed to and accepted by him. It added that, though the secretary of the DILG is the alter ego of the President and notice to him may be considered notice to the President, the records are bereft of any evidence showing that the DILG secretary received and accepted the resignation letter of Antonio.
Moreover, granting that there was complete and effective resignation, private respondent was still the president of the ABC and, as such, he was qualified to sit in the 
Sangguniang Bayan
 in an ex officio capacity by virtue of Section 494
[21]
  of R.A. 7160
[22]
  and Memorandum Circular No. 92-38.
[23]
  In view, however, of the May 1994 elections in which a new set of barangay officials was elected, Antonioâs reassumption of office as barangay representative to the Sangguniang Bayan was no longer legally feasible.
The appellate court added that private respondent could not be considered to have abandoned his office. His designation as member of the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 was merely temporary and not incompatible with his position as president of the ABC of San Andres, Catanduanes.
Finally, Respondent Court deleted the award of attorneyâs fees for being without basis, and held that Resolution Nos. 6 and 28 of the 
Sangguniang Bayan
 of San Andres involved a valid exercise of the powers of said local body. It thus modified the trial courtâs judgment by affirming paragraph 3 and deleting the other items. Unsatisfied, petitioners brought the present recourse.
[24]
 
Issues
The petitioner, in its memorandum,
[25]
  submits before this Court the following issues:
âI. Whether or not respondentâs resignation as ex-officio member of Petitioner Sangguniang Bayan ng San Andres, Catanduanes is deemed complete so as to terminate his official relation thereto;
âII.       Whether or not respondent had totally abandoned his ex-officio membership in Petitioner Sangguniang Bayan;
âIII. Whether or not respondent is entitled to collect salaries similar to those received by other members of Petitioner Sangguniang Bayan from April 8, 1992 up to date of judgment in this case by the Regional Trial Court of Virac, Catanduanes.â
[26]
 
In sum, was there a complete and effective resignation? If not, was there an abandonment of office?
This Courtâs Ruling
The petition is meritorious. Although the terms of office of barangay captains, including private respondent, elected in March 1989 have expired, the Court deemed it necessary to resolve this case, as the Court of Appeals had ordered the payment of the uncollected salaries allegedly due prior to the expiration of Respondent Antonioâs term.
First Issue: Validity of Resignation
The petitioner submits that the resignation of private respondent was valid and effective despite the absence of an express acceptance by the President of the Philippines. The letter of resignation was submitted to the secretary of the DILG, an alter ego of the President, the appointing authority. The acceptance of respondentâs resignation may be inferred from the fact that the DILG secretary himself appointed him a member of the 
Sangguniang Panlalawigan
 of Catanduanes.
[27]
 
In 
Ortiz vs. COMELEC
,
[28]
  we defined resignation as the âact of giving up or the act of an officer by which he declines his office and renounces the further right to use it. It is an expression of the incumbent in some form, express or implied, of the intention to surrender, renounce, and relinquish the office and the acceptance by competent and lawful authority.â To constitute a complete and operative resignation from public office, there must be: (a) an intention to relinquish a part of the term; (b) an act of relinquishment; and (c) an acceptance by the proper authority.
[29]
  The last one is required by reason of Article 238 of the Revised Penal Code.
[30]
 
The records are bereft of any evidence that private respondentâs resignation was accepted by the proper authority. From the time that he was elected as 
punong barangay
 up to the time he resigned as a member of Sangguniang Bayan, the governing law was B.P. 337 or the Local Government Code of 1983. While said law was silent as to who specifically should accept the resignation of an appointive member of the 
Sangguniang Bayan
, Sec. 6 of Rule XIX of its implementing rules states that the â[r]esignation of 
sanggunian
 members shall be acted upon by the 
sanggunian
 concerned, and a copy of the action taken shall be furnished the official responsible for appointing a replacement and the Ministry of Local Government. The position shall be deemed vacated only upon acceptance of the resignation.â
It is not disputed that private respondentâs resignation letter was addressed only to the municipal mayor of San Andres, Catanduanes. It is indicated thereon that copies were furnished the provincial governor, the municipal treasurer and the DILG. Neither the mayor nor the officers who had been furnished copies of said letter expressly acted on it. On hindsight, and assuming arguendo that the aforecited Sec. 6 of Rule XIX is valid and applicable, the mayor should have referred or endorsed the latter to the 
Sangguniang Bayan
 for proper action. In any event, there is no evidence that the resignation was accepted by any government functionary or office.
Parenthetically, Section 146 of B.P. Blg. 337 states:
âSec. 146. 
Composition
. - (1) The sangguniang bayan shall be the legislative body of the municipality and shall be composed of the municipal mayor, who shall be the presiding officer, the vice-mayor, who shall be the presiding officer pro tempore, eight members elected at large, and 
the members appointed by the President consisting of the president of the katipunang bayan
 and the president of the kabataang barangay municipal federation. x x x.â (Emphasis supplied.)
Under established jurisprudence, resignations, in the absence of statutory provisions as to whom they should be submitted, should be tendered to the appointing person or body.
[31]
  Private respondent, therefore, should have submitted his letter of resignation to the President or to his alter ego, the DILG secretary. Although he supposedly furnished the latter a copy of his letter, there is no showing that it was duly received, much less, that it was acted upon. The third requisite being absent, there was therefore no valid and complete resignation.
Second Issue: 
Abandonment of Office
While we agree with Respondent Court that the resignation was not valid absent any acceptance thereof by the proper authority, we nonetheless hold that Private Respondent Antonio has effectively relinquished his membership in the 
Sangguniang Bayan
 due to his voluntary abandonment of said post.
Abandonment of an office has been defined as the voluntary relinquishment of an office by the holder, with the intention of terminating his possession and control thereof.
[32]
  Indeed, abandonment of office is a species of resignation; while resignation in general is a formal relinquishment, abandonment is a voluntary relinquishment through nonuser.
[33]
  Nonuser refers to a neglect to use a privilege or a right (
Cyclopedic Law Dictionary,
 3rd ed.) or to exercise an easement or an office (
Blackâs Law Dictionary,
 6th ed.).
Abandonment springs from and is accompanied by deliberation and freedom of choice.
[34]
  Its concomitant effect is that the former holder of an office can no longer legally repossess it even by forcible reoccupancy.
[35]
 
Clear intention to abandon should be manifested by the officer concerned. Such intention may be express or inferred from his own conduct.
[36]
  Thus, the failure to perform the duties pertaining to the office must be with the officerâs actual or imputed intention to abandon and relinquish the office.
[37]
  Abandonment of an office is not wholly a matter of intention; it results from a complete abandonment of duties of such a continuance that the law will infer a relinquishment.
[38]
  Therefore, there are two essential elements of abandonment: first, an intention to abandon and, 
second,
 an overt or âexternalâ act by which the intention is carried into effect. 
[39]
 
Petitioner argues that the following clearly demonstrate private respondentâs abandonment of his post in the 
Sangguniang Bayan
:
âAdmittedly, the designation of respondent as member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Catanduanes was worded âtemporary,â but his acts more than clearly established his intention to totally abandon his office, indicating an absolute relinquishment thereof. It bears to emphasize that respondent actually 
tendered his resignation and subsequently accepted an ex-officio membership in the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Catanduanes. He performed his duties and functions of said office for almost two (2) years, and was completely aware of the appointment and assumption on July 18, 1990 of Nenito F. Aquino,
 who was then Vice-President of the Association of Barangay Councils (ABC) of San Andres, Catanduanes, as ex-officio member of petitioner Sangguniang Bayan representing the ABC.
x x x                                             x x x                                     x x x
Moreover, it may be well-noted that ABC Vice President Nenito Aquino assumed respondentâs former position for twenty (20) months, without him questioning the term of office of the former if indeed respondentâs designation as ex-officio member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan was only temporary. Likewise, for almost eight (8) months after knowledge of the decision in 
Taule vs. Santos, et. al., Ibid.,
 nullifying his designation as representative to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, respondent opted to remain silent, and in fact failed to seasonably act for the purpose of reassuming his former position. Evidently, respondent had clearly abandoned his former position by voluntary relinquishment of his office through non-user.â
[40]
  [Underscoring supplied.]
We agree with petitioner. Indeed, the following clearly manifest the intention of private respondent to abandon his position: (1) his failure to perform his function as member of the 
Sangguniang Bayan
, (2) his failure to collect the corresponding remuneration for the position, (3) his failure to object to the appointment of Aquino as his replacement in the Sangguniang Bayan, (4) his prolonged failure to initiate any act to reassume his post in the Sangguniang Bayan after the Supreme Court had nullified his designation to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.
On the other hand, the following overt acts demonstrate that he had effected his intention: (1) his letter of resignation from the Sangguniang Bayan;
[41]
  (2) his assumption of office as member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, (3) his faithful discharge of his duties and functions as member of said Sanggunian, and (4) his receipt of the remuneration for such post.
It must be stressed that when an officer is âdesignatedâ to another post, he is usually called upon to discharge duties in addition to his regular responsibilities. Indeed, his additional responsibilities are prescribed by law to inhere, as it were, to his original position. A Supreme Court justice, for instance, may be designated member of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal. In some cases, a public officer may be âdesignatedâ to a position in an acting capacity, as when an undersecretary is tasked to discharge the functions of a secretary for a temporary period.
[42]
  In all cases, however, the law does not require the public servant to resign from his original post. Rather, the law allows him to concurrently discharge the functions of both offices.
Private respondent, however, did not simultaneously discharge the duties and obligations of both positions. Neither did he, at that time, express an intention to resume his office as member of the Sangguniang Bayan. His overt acts, silence, inaction and acquiescence, when Aquino succeeded him to his original position, show that Antonio had abandoned the contested office. His immediate and natural reaction upon Aquinoâs appointment should have been to object or, failing to do that, to file appropriate legal action or proceeding. But he did neither. It is significant that he expressed his intention to resume office only on March 31, 1992, after Aquino had been deemed resigned on March 23, 1992, and months after this Court had nullified his âdesignationâ on August 12, 1991. From his passivity, he is deemed to have recognized the validity of Aquinoâs appointment and the latterâs discharge of his duties as a member of the 
Sangguniang Bayan.
In all, private respondentâs failure to promptly assert his alleged right implies his loss of interest in the position. His overt acts plainly show that he really meant his resignation and understood its effects. As pointed out by the eminent American commentator, Mechem:
[43]
 
âPublic offices are held upon the implied condition that the officer will diligently and faithfully execute the duties belonging to them, and while a temporary or accidental failure to perform them in a single instance or during a short period will not operate as an abandonment, yet if the officer refuses or neglects to exercise the functions of the office for so long a period as to reasonably warrant the presumption that he does not desire or intend to perform the duties of the office at all, he will be held to have abandoned it, not only when his refusal to perform was wilful, but also where, while he intended to vacate the office, it was because he in good faith but mistakenly supposed he had no right to hold it.â
Lastly, private respondent, who remained ABC president, claims the legal right to be a member of the Sangguniang Bayan by virtue of Section 146 of B.P. Blg. 337. However, his right thereto is not self-executory, for the law itself requires another positive act -- an appointment by the President or the secretary of local government per E.O. 342.
[44]
  What private respondent could have done in order to be able to reassume his post after Aquinoâs resignation was to seek a reappointment from the President or the secretary of local government. By and large, private respondent cannot claim an absolute right to the office which, by his own actuations, he is deemed to have relinquished.
[45]
 
We reiterate our ruling in 
Aparri vs. Court of Appeals:
 
[46]
 
âA public office is the right, authority, and duty created and conferred by law, by which for a given period, either fixed by law or enduring at the pleasure of the creating power, an individual is invested with some portion of the sovereign functions of the government, to be exercised by him for the benefit of the public x x x. The right to hold a public office under our political system is therefore not a natural right. It exists, when it exists at all, only because and by virtue of some law expressly or impliedly creating and conferring it x x x. There is no such thing as a vested interest or an estate in an office, or even an absolute right to hold office. Excepting constitutional offices which provide for special immunity as regards salary and tenure, no one can be said to have any vested right in an office or its salary x x x.â
Third Issue: Salary
Having ruled that private respondent had voluntarily abandoned his post at the 
Sangguniang Bayan,
 he cannot be entitled to any back salaries. Basic is the âno work, no payâ
[47]
  rule. A public officer is entitled to receive compensation for services actually rendered for as long as he has the right to the office being claimed.
[48]
  When the act or conduct of a public servant constitutes a relinquishment of his office, he has no right to receive any salary incident to the office he had abandoned.
