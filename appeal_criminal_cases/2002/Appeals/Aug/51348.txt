PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. SALVADOR MIRANDA Y CAPE, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PER CURIAM:




For automatic review by this Court is the decision of the Regional 
Trial Court, 5th Judicial Region, Branch 57, Libmanan, Camarines Sur 
imposing the death penalty on the accused-appellant, Salvador Miranda 
for raping his fourteen-year old daughter, Teresita.  


 The Information reads as follows: 




The undersigned 4th Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of Camarines 
Sur, upon a sworn complaint filed by Teresita L. Miranda, hereby accuses
 SALVADOR MIRANDA y DOE for the crime of RAPE defined and penalized 
under Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to R.A. 7659, 
committed as follows: 




 That sometime in February, 1998 at Sitio Sampaloc, Barangay Banga 
Caves, Municipality of Ragay, Province of Camarines Sur, Philippines, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, with lewd designs, by means of force and intimidation, and 
while armed with a fan-knife, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully 
and feloniously have sexual intercourse with his 14 year old daughter, 
TERESITA L. MIRANDA against her will, to her damage and prejudice. 




ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.
[1]
 




When arraigned on October 25, 1998, the accused-appellant pleaded 
ânot guilty.â Pre-trial was waived so trial ensued. The prosecution 
presented the victim and the medico-legal officer as witnesses. The 
medico-legal report was offered as their documentary evidence. For the 
defense, only the accused-appellant testified on his own behalf. 


On January 17, 2000, the RTC rendered its decision with the following dispositive portion: 




WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, this Court finds the 
accused, SALVADOR MIRANDA, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime 
of Rape, as defined and punished under Article 335 of the Revised Penal 
Code as amended, and hereby sentences him to the supreme penalty of 
DEATH. He is likewise directed to pay his daughter damages of Fifty 
Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00), exemplary damages of Thirty Thousand Pesos 
(P30,000.00) and to pay the costs of this suit. Considering his old age,
 however, this Court hereby recommends that the penalty be commuted to 
Reclusion Perpetua
. 


Let the record of this case be forwarded to the Supreme Court on automatic review.
[2]
 




The facts as found by the trial court are as follows: 




Sometime in February 1998, Teresita (Tessie) did not go to 
school. Her other siblings were in school, while the older ones who were
 already married lived in their respective houses. Her mother was 
washing clothes near her brotherâs place, while her father was engaged 
in a drinking bout with four men. At about 12:00 noon, her father, 
smelling a gin, went inside their house, and pulled her towards the 
room. Tessie was not able to shout or make any sound, afraid that her 
father might hurt her. Her father removed her T-shirt and shorts and 
then undressed himself. He made her lie down on the floor, then he laid 
down also and inserted his penis into her vagina. The initial, unwelcome
 and detestable experience was excruciating that Tessie cried. She was 
still naked when her mother Rosella arrived. His father stood up, wore 
his shorts and did not answer his wifeâs query what he did to their 
child. Rosella got angry and asked her husband why did he do it, but the
 latter did not speak and just went away as if nothing happened. Tessie,
 in tears, told her mother about her carnal defilement in the hands of 
her father that day. The following day Tessie, together with her aunt, 
Casiana Miranda, went to Daet where she stayed with the latterâs 
daughter for a month, until her mother fetched her. Her elder sister 
Hilda Navarro, who came to learn of her fate from her mother, brought 
her to the police authorities. She executed a sworn statement before 
police at Ragay, Camarines Sur (Exhibit B, p. 4, Record). 


Dr. Marilyn Folloso, Municipal Health Officer of Ragay, examined 
Tessie Miranda on March 24, 1998. The medical certificate (Exhibit A, 
p.5, Record) indicated the following: 


âPertinent PE findings: 


Healed, Complete, Hymenal Laceration at 4:00 oâclockâ  


x x x
[3]
 




The accused-appellant denied the accusations and claimed that he 
was in the farm busy plowing the field in February, 1998. He denied that
 he was drunk that noon of February and asserted that he goes to the 
farm everyday, in February, or even before that month and also in March 
until he was arrested by the police.
[4]



  In this appeal, the accused-appellant raised the lone assignment of error that: 




THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF 
RAPE DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO STATE IN THE INFORMATION THE 
PRECISE DATE OF THE COMMISSION OF THE ALLEGED OFFENSE.
[5]
 




The accused-appellant asserts that the Information where he is 
charged for rape is fatally defective as it does not state the 
approximate time of the commission of the crime in violation of the 
Rules of Court.
[6]
 


The information merely states that the rape was allegedly committed
 âsometime in February 1988.â As it does not mention the precise time 
and date when the rape was committed; the Information must, therefore, 
be considered void. Such defect jeopardizes the right of the 
accused-appellant to be informed of the offense charged. With this 
constitutional infirmity, the accused-appellant deserves an acquittal. 


The contention is untenable. 


In refutation of accused-appellantâs argument, the Office of the 
Solicitor General (OSG) presented adequate jurisprudence on the matter 
that it is not necessary for the information to allege the date and time
 of the commission of the crime with exactitude unless the time is an 
essential ingredient of the crime.
[7]
 In the crime of rape, the time of its commission is not âa material ingredient of the offense.â
[8]

 It is sufficient that the act complained of is alleged to have taken 
place âas near to the actual date at which the offense was committed as 
the information or complaint will permit.â
[9]

 It can not be said that the accused-appellant was not properly apprised
 of the charges proffered against him. There is, therefore, no merit in 
accused-appellantâs appeal. 


After a careful review, we find the findings and conclusions of the
 trial court to be in accord with the law and jurisprudence and 
supported by evidence. The trial court gave credence to the testimony of
 the victim because she testified in a candid and straightforward 
manner. It had the badges of truth considering that the trial court 
found no motive which would make her testify falsely against the father 
if she has not really been aggrieved. She testified, to wit:

Although the Information indicated that the accused-appellant was 
armed with a fan-knife at that time he sexually assaulted his daughter, 
the prosecution, however, failed to prove this allegation as it no 
longer pursued the subject during the direct testimony of the 
complainant. Nonetheless, the trial court justified the presence of 
force and intimidation in the case, as it correctly explained, that: 




xxx In a rape case by a father against her own daughter, his 
moral ascendancy and influence over the latter can sufficiently 
substitute for violence and intimidation. Thus, even without any weapon,
 his being a father is enough to intimidate and bring dread to a very 
young daughter.
[11]
 




Indeed, in cases of incestuous rape, the accused-appellantâs moral 
ascendancy over the victim takes the place of the force and intimidation
 in rape.
[12]
 The force and 
intimidation is subjective and should be viewed in the context of the 
victimâs perception and judgment at that time of the commission of the 
offense.
[13]
 Teresita 
testified that she submitted herself to the father because she was 
afraid that he might hurt her. She noticed that his father was drunk, 
knowing that he had a drinking spree in their house at that time. No 
words of threat were necessary because her fatherâs presence and moral 
ascendancy was intimidating enough for Teresita not to resist his 
advances. The fact that Teresita failed to put up a strong resistance or
 shout for help cannot be considered consent. This lack of resistance on
 the part of the victim as a product of the moral ascendancy is very 
well explained in the case of 
People v. Chua:
[14]
 




In Philippine society, the father is considered the head of the 
family, and the children are taught not to defy the fatherâs authority 
even when this is abused. They are taught to respect the sanctity of 
marriage and to value the family above everything else. Hence, when the 
abuse begins, the victim sees no reason or need to question the 
righteousness of the father whom she had trusted right from the start. 
The value of respect and obedience to parents instilled among Filipino 
children is transferred into the very same value that exposes them to 
risks of exploitation by their own parents. The sexual relationship 
could begin so subtly that the child does not realize that it is 
abnormal. Physical force then becomes unnecessary. The perpetrator takes
 full advantage of this blood relationship. Most daughters cooperate and
 this is one reason why they suffer tremendous guilt later on. It is 
almost impossible for a daughter to reject her fatherâs advances, for 
children seldom question what grown-ups tell them to do. 




Apparently in the case at bar, the accused-appellant certainly 
abused the reverence and respect which his daughter had for him as he 
was successful in forcing her to submit to his lust. The pain and trauma
 which she experienced could not be concealed. Her anger and resentment 
against her father was clearly manifested in her testimony. When asked 
on cross-examination, she knew and understood the consequences of her 
charge for she had this determined resolve to put her father to death as
 a result of the incident. When a woman says that she has been raped, 
she says, in effect, all that is necessary to show that she has indeed 
been raped.
[15]
 She testified on cross-examination: 




ATTY. MIRABUENO: 


Q     You said that your father and uncle and two other persons were drinking at that time, can you still remember that? 

      A     Yes, Sir. 


Q     What were they drinking? 

      A     Tanduay, Sir. 


ATTY. MIRABUENO: 


Q     You said during direct examination, your father drinking 
gin and now you said drinking Tanduay, which is now correct, Gin or 
Tanduay? 

      A     Tanduay, Sir. 


Q     So your testimony that he smelled Gin is not correct? 

      A     Yes, Sir. 


Q     What time did they start drinking? 

      A     11:00 A.M., Sir. 


Q     And what time did they finish in drinking? 

      A     I do not know, Sir. 


Q     Did they drink up to afternoon? 

      A     No, Sir. 


Q     Up to 1:00 oâclock in the afternoon? 

    A     No, Sir. 


Q     Up to 12:00 Noon? 

    A     Before 12:00 Noon, Sir. 


Q     Aside from them, as you mentioned they were four persons drinking, was there any other persons at that time? 

    A     None, Sir. 


Q     When your father, according to you, he pulled you, did you not shout? 

    A     No, Sir. 


Q     Did you not ask your father, why you were being pulled by him? 

    A     No, Sir. 


Q     After the following day that your father allegedly insert 
his penis to your vagina, did you tell to anybody of what happened to 
you? 

    A     Yes, Sir. 


Q     To whom? 

    A     To my sister, Sir. 


Q     What time did you tell to her? 

    A     My mother was the one who told her. 


Q     So, it was your mother who told her and not you, is that correct? 

    A     Yes, Sir. 


Q     Now, do you know that if found out your father really raped you, he put to death, you understand that? 

    A     Yes, Sir. 


Q     Do you want your father to die? 

    A     Yes, Sir. 


Q     You can not forgive your father? 

    A     No, Sir. 


ATTY. MIRABUENO: 


Thatâs all, Your Honor. 


COURT: 


Q     Where is your mother, Tessie? 

      A     She is outside, Maâam. 


Q     Why, that your sister only who helping you in this case? 

    A     When I arrived in Daet, Nilda is not supporting me, but when 
my mother took me from Daet, Ate Nilda brought me to the Police. 


Q     Are you angry with your father? 

      A     Yes, Maâam. 


COURT: 


Q     Why? 

    A     Because of what did he do it to me. 


Q     Before the alleged incident, is your father angry to you? 

      A     I do not know, Maâam. 


Q     Even before that date, did he hurt you? 

      A     No, Maâam. 


Q     Was this is (sic) first time did your father to you? 

      A     Yes, Maâam. 


Q When your mother arrived, was he still on top of you? 

      A     No more, Maâam. 


Q     Do you know that your parents are instrument in giving your life? 

      A     Yes, Maâam. 


Q     Before the incident, did you love your parents particularly your father? 

      A     Yes, Maâam. 


Q     But now, you want that your father be sentenced to death? 

      A     Yes, Maâam. 


Q     What did you feel now, for what your father do to you? 

      A     Painful, Maâam.
[16]
 




The accused-appellant merely denied raping his daughter and 
interposed alibi for his defense. Unfortunately, this self-serving 
denial can not prevail over the affirmative and categorical assertions 
of the victim which the trial court found to be more credible. For alibi
 to prosper, the accused-appellant must prove that he was somewhere else
 when the crime was committed and it was physically impossible for him 
to have been at the scene of the crime.
[17]

 In the case at bar, the farm was not too far from the house and the 
accused-appellant even admitted that he goes home for lunch. Thus, it 
was not impossible that the accused-appellant committed the dastardly 
act on his daughter on that fateful afternoon. 


The rape committed on the victim falls under the qualifying circumstances listed under R.A. 7659.
[18]

 considering the relationship of the accused-appellant to the victim and
 the latterâs minority in which case the imposition of the death penalty
 is mandatory.
[19]
 The 
concurrence of these two circumstances must not only be pleaded in the 
information but must, likewise, be proven beyond reasonable doubt. The 
prosecution presented the birth certificate,
[20]
 to show that the victim was only 13 years old at the time of the incident and that Salvador Miranda was her father.
[21]

 At the time she testified in court in 1999, it was not difficult for 
the trial court to take judicial notice that the victim was certainly 
under 18 years old. 


We note the trial courtâs disposition recommending a commutation of
 this sentence to 
reclusion perpetua
 considering the alleged old age of 
the accused-appellant. The records reveal that the accused-appellant was
 only 55 years old at the time he testified in court in 1999.
[22]
 Obviously, he does not enjoy the commutation of penalty provided by law.
[23]
 The law may be exceedingly hard but so the law is written and the Court is duty bound to apply it.
[24]

 The death penalty is certainly irrevocable and deplorable but given the
 pertinent circumstances obtaining in this case which have been duly 
proven by the prosecution, the Court is constrained to affirm the 
imposable penalty of death in this case.
[25]
 


Finally, the award of damages by the trial court should also be 
modified in line with recent jurisprudence on the matter. In addition to
 the moral damages of P50,000.00 which need not be proven, a civil 
indemnity of P75,000.00 is awarded if the crime was committed under 
circumstances that justify the imposition of the death penalty.
[26]
 Exemplary damages should also be reduced to P25,000.00,
[27]
 to deter fathers from abusing their daughters. 


WHEREFORE,
 the decision of the trial court in 
Criminal case No. L-2071 is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the 
accused-appellant is ordered to pay complainant Teresita Miranda the 
amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages and
 P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.
