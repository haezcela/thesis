 on the head, which directly caused her death. 


CONTRARY TO LAW.
[1]
 




Upon arraignment, the accused-appellant pleaded not guilty. Trial, 
thereby, ensued with the prosecution presenting (1) Rita Ballesteros, 
(2) Alfredo Manabat, (3) Mariano Tumolva, (4) Placido Gangan, (5) 
Elizabeth Deraco, (6) SPO2 Walberto Agpawa and (7) Dr. Conrado Gabriel, 
Sr. as their witnesses. For the defense, the accused-appellant and his 
live-in partner, Susan Domalanta testified in court. 


The facts as found by the trial court are as follows: 




In the early morning of February 28, 1995, ten (10) years old 
Rhea Ballesteros bade good-bye to her mother Rita Ballesteros to attend 
her classes at East Central Elementary School, Ilagan, Isabela. She was 
dressed with the school regulation uniform of white shirt, blue skirt, 
white socks with brown shoes and carried a school bag colored black and 
green. Inside her bag were ruled pad, pencil, notebook and a school 
book. 


Manuel Gannaban works as a baker at Elsaâs Bake Shop owned by 
Elizabeth Deraco of Centro, Ilagan, Isabela. During his stint as a baker
 in that shop, he befriended Rhea according to Deraco (see also Exh. 
âEâ). At about 11:00 A.M. on February 28, 1995, Gannaban left the Bake 
Shop for Barangay San Ignacio, Ilagan, Isabela. 


On the same day, February 28, 1995, between 3:00 and 4:00 P.M. , 
Alfredo Manabat was playing basketball at the barangay park with Mario 
Carino and others at San Ignacio, Ilagan, Isabela. Manabat saw Gannaban 
pass by the park with a young girl. She was wearing a white shirt and 
blue skirt. Both were going towards the northern direction of the 
barangay (see also Exhibit âAâ). 


On the same day, between 4:00 and 5:00 P.M., Mariano Tumolva, a 
fisherman and a widower was at home at Barangay San Ignacio, Ilagan, 
Isabela. Gannaban and a young girl about 10 years old arrived in the 
house and asked for food. Gannaban who is well known to Tumolva, cooked 
salted fish with tomatoes and rice. The young girl ate, Gannaban did 
not. They stayed in the house for less than 30 minutes. After the young 
girl took her meal, she left with Gannaban, southbound. According to 
Tumolva, they were going home to the town proper Ilagan (see also Exh. 
âBâ). 


Placido Gangan, of Baculud Norte, Ilagan, Isabela, arrived at his
 house at about 7:00 P.M., February 28, 1995 to rest after making his 
daily routine with his motorized passenger tricycle. Gangan found 
Gannaban and a young girl at their house. His wife asked for the name of
 the young girl who was dressed with a white shirt and blue skirt and he
 came to know from the wife her name as Rhea Ballesteros. Gannaban was 
asking accommodation for the night. His wife cooked cabbage for supper 
and they shared and dined together. They were given another room of the 
house to spend the night. At about 5:00 A.M., March 1, 1995, the 
visitors of Gangan left their house. 


At about 6:00 A.M., March 1, 1995, Gannaban returned to the 
bakeshop of Deraco. When Deraco confronted him where he came from 
Gannaban told her he came from San Ignacio. Deraco also confronted 
Gannaban why he was with Rhea but Gannaban kept silent. In the evening 
of March 1, 1995, Gannaban, together with a certain Inggo and Larry had a
 drinking spree in a carinderia on the top floor of Ilagan supermarket. 
In the early morning of March 2, 1995 at about 3:00 A.M., Deraco went to
 her bakeshop to wake up Gannaban. She found out Gannaban was no longer 
there. He took all his belongings and left without taking his unpaid 
salary of P300.00. Since that time, Gannaban never returned to the shop.
 


In the meantime, when Rhea did not go home, Rita Ballesteros 
together with her husband and sons, looked for her around the town. She 
was nowhere to be found. On the second day, March 1, 1995, they again 
looked for her and reported her missing to the PNP of Ilagan and one 
Crisel Ferrer, a Bombo reporter. Ferrer reported over Bombo Radio about 
the missing Rhea. 


At about 7:00 A.M., March 4, 1995, SPO2 Walberto Agpawa received a
 report from one, Oscar Adorio, that he found a âcadaver of foul playâ 
at his cornfield at Bagumbayan, Ilagan, Isabela. Agpawa, together with 
Station Commander Nepomuceno Alindada, Jr., and Dr. Conrado S. Gabriel, 
Sr., proceeded to the corn plantation of Adorio. Alindada must have 
dropped by the house of Rita Ballesteros before they reached the 
cornfields reason for which Rita was present in that cornfield. When 
they reached the cornfield, they found the body of a young girl in rigor
 mortis. The right side of her head was bashed and there was a crack on 
that side. The cadaver was wearing a white T-shirt, her blue skirt was 
raised to her waist, her panty was in her legs exposing her private 
parts. Rita Ballesteros identified Rhea thru a mole found at her upper 
right back. Scattered around her were her school bag, papers, pencil and
 her shoes. 


Dr. Conrado Gabriel, Sr. conducted a post mortem examination and submitted Exhibit âDâ, Medico Legal Report, as follows: 




âBODY: 


1) SKULL = Right mastroid process damage. 


2) VAGINA = a) Cervix laceration 5 oâclock 12 oâclock 




Body = state of decomposition 




âCAUSE OF DEATH: 


Hypovolemic shock, due to Internal Hemorrhage, Rape Accident.â
[2]
 


On July 30, 1998, the RTC rendered its judgment with the following dispositive portion: 




WHEREFORE, and in view of the foregoing, the Court finds the 
accused MANUEL GANNABAN guilty beyond any reasonable doubt for the rape 
and death of Rhea Ballesteros. No matter how personally revolting on the
 Court to impose the death penalty, this Court must bow and obey the law
 of the land. Manuel Gannaban is hereby sentenced to suffer the supreme 
penalty of death as provided for and penalized under Article 335 of the 
Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659. He is further 
ordered to indemnify the heirs of young Rhea the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND 
(P50,000.00) PESOS, to pay P50,000.00 as moral damages and the further 
sum of FIFTY THOUSAND (P50,000.00) PESOS, as exemplary damages and to 
pay the costs. 


SO ORDERED.
[3]
 




In this appeal, the accused-appellant raised the following assignment of errors: 




I 


THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT 
GUILTY OF RAPE WITH HOMICIDE BASED ON PURELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. 


II 


THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE DEFENSE PUT UP 
BY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS WELL AS THE ESSENCE OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE 
DOCTOR WHO CONDUCTED THE POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION ON THE VICTIM.
[4]
 




The only issue to be resolved in the instant case is whether or not
 the accused-appellantâs guilt for the crime of rape with homicide has 
been proven beyond reasonable doubt based on circumstantial evidence. 


Conviction can be had on the basis of circumstantial evidence so 
long as a combination of all the circumstances proven produces a logical
 conclusion which suffices to establish accused-appellantâs guilt beyond
 reasonable doubt.
[5]
 
Circumstantial evidence may be sufficiently cogent to satisfy the 
judicial conscience and may be as potent as direct testimony in tending 
to connect the accused-appellant with the commission of the offense.
[6]

 As clearly pointed out by the OSG, the circumstances testified by the 
prosecution witnesses lead to the inevitable conclusion that the 
accused-appellant is the author of the crime, to wit: 


Rita Ballesteros, the mother of Rhea Ballesteros testified:

Q     When Manuel Gannaban went to your house on February 28, 1995, do you already know his name on that date?

      A     I used to know him, sir.

Although he failed to inquire from appellant or the young girl 
herself about the latterâs name, Mariano Tumolva identified (through a 
picture) the victim as the same young girl companion of appellant. He 
testified: 


Q     (PROS. FAUSTO CABANTAC)

Ballesteros and I even told him not to go with her because the father of
 that girl is a killer.

SPO2 Walberto Agpawa testified that on March 4, 1995, he found the 
lifeless body of Rhea Ballesteros in the cornfields with her head 
bashed. She was wearing white T-shirt and blue skirt and her underwear 
partially removed so that her private parts were exposed. The police 
also found at the scene of the crime the victimâs school bag, notebooks 
and books scattered all over the place.
[8]
 


Dr. Conrado Gabriel, Sr. retired Municipal Health Officer of 
Ilagan, Isabela who conducted a post-mortem examination on the cadaver 
of Rhea Ballesteros testified that the body was already in a state of 
decomposition. The victim had a broken mouth. An examination of her 
vagina revealed hymenal lacerations at the 5 oâclock and 12 oâclock 
positions. Dr. Gabriel concluded that the victim died of hypovolemic 
shock due to internal hemorrhage caused by the broken mouth. He further 
stated that this case was a rape accident.
[9]
 


The accused-appellant questions the credibility of the prosecution 
witnesses alleging that each one of them has an ax to grind against him 
or that they were rehearsed witnesses. Against these positive assertions
 of the prosecution witnesses, however, it is quite difficult to believe
 the accused-appellantâs version. For his defense, the accused-appellant
 interposed alibi which to the mind of the Court is so weak and does not
 engender belief. His live-in partnerâs testimony that the 
accused-appellant was with her during the time of the commission of the 
crime is not enough to overcome the positive assertions of the 
prosecution witnesses that they last saw the victim with the 
accused-appellant. No other witnesses were presented to corroborate the 
allegation that the accused-appellant and his live-in partner, Susan 
Domalanta lived together continuously for two months. When the issue is 
one of the credibility of the witnesses, weight is given to the findings
 of the trial court as it is more in the position to observe the 
demeanor of these witnesses. 

    Undoubtedly, the victim was last seen in the company of the 
accused-appellant by prosecution witness Placido Gangan who testified 
that both of them slept in their house on the night of February 28, 1995
 and left at 5:00 oâclock in the morning of the next day, March 1, 1995.
 Rhea Ballesteros was in her school uniform when they left the place of 
Placido Gangan and her lifeless body which was discovered on March 4, 
1995, already decomposing, still donned the same uniform. While it is 
true that the accused-appellant apparently reported to the bakery at 
6:00 oâclock in the morning of March 1, 1995 and had a drinking spree 
that night, his sudden flight from the bakery the early morning of March
 2, 1995 was quite suspect. He was silent when he was confronted by his 
employer Elizabeth Derraco about the whereabouts of Rhea Ballesteros who
 was reported missing already at that time.
[10]

 If he had nothing to do with the disappearance of Rhea Ballesteros 
during that time, why did the accused-appellant flee from the place 
without any warning at all, bringing with him all his belongings and 
without even bothering to get the remaining balance of his salary? There
 appears no other reason for this sudden departure except Elizabeth 
Derracoâs persistent warning for him not to see Rhea Ballesteros because
 the latterâs father is a killer. She had basis to warn him because she 
knew that the accused-appellant and the victim were together.
[11]
 The accused-appellantâs immediate flight is strongly indicative of his consciousness of guilt 
[12]
 for as the proverb says, âthe wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are as bold as a lion.â
[13]
 


Furthermore, we agree with the trial courtâs observation that it 
was rather strange for the accused-appellant to be sleeping together 
with the victim in one room at the house of Placido Gangan in the night 
of February 28, 1995. If he really had good intentions of the victim, he
 should have slept separately from her, out of delicadeza.
[14]

 Apparently, the accused-appellant had an evil motive for the victim. 
The fact of rape was also clearly established by the medico-legal report
 which states that the victim had lacerations in her vagina. The body 
was found with the victimâs blue skirt up to her waist and her panty 
pulled down to her legs, exposing her private parts. Unfortunately, a 
thorough autopsy examination of the body was no longer conducted as the 
body was already in its third state of decomposition.
[15]
 Notwithstanding, the tell-tale signs of rape were apparent. 


After all evidence considered, the Court is constrained to affirm 
the penalty of death imposed by the trial court. Three justices of the 
Court continue to maintain the unconstitutionality of R.A. 7659 insofar 
as it prescribes the death penalty. Nevertheless, they submit to the 
ruling of the majority to the effect that this law is constitutional and
 that the death penalty can be lawfully imposed in the case at bar. 


Anent the amount of damages awarded by the trial court, there is 
need to modify the same in accordance with recent jurisprudence on the 
matter. R.A. 7659 provides that: âwhen by reason or on the occasion of 
the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty is death.â In rape with 
homicide, civil indemnity is increased to P100,000.00.
[16]
 An award of P50,000.00 for moral damages without need of proof is also in order.
[17]

 The exemplary damages of P50,000.00 awarded by the trial court should 
be deleted, there being no proof of aggravating circumstance. 
Considering that it was admitted in court that the heirs of the victim 
spent P15,000.00 for funeral and burial expenses,
[18]
 the Court shall allow the same. 


WHEREFORE,
 the conviction of Manuel Gannaban is 
hereby AFFIRMED. Accused-appellant is directed to indemnify the heirs of
 the victim in the amount of P 100,000.00 as civil indemnity. In 
addition, the accused-appellant is also hereby ordered to pay P50,000.00
 as moral damages and P15,000.00 as actual damages. 


In accordance with Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659 amending 
Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, upon finality of this decision, 
let the records of this case be forthwith forwarded to the Office of the
 President for possible exercise of the pardoning power.
