PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. LEONARDO BAUTISTA Y ADOCA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




PUNO, J.:


 This is an automatic review of the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela, Metro Manila, Branch 75 in Criminal Case No. 3889-V-94 finding accused-appellant guilty of the crime of statutory rape and sentencing him to death.
In an Information dated February 7, 1994, accused-appellant Leonardo Bautista y Adoca was charged with the crime of statutory rape committed as follows:
âThat on or about the 4
th
 day of February 1994 in Valenzuela, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with one MA. THERESA BAUTISTA y EBESA, ten years old.
Contrary to law.
Valenzuela, Metro Manila, February 7, 1994.â
[1]
On August 31, 1994, accused-appellant was arraigned and he pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. At the trial, the prosecution presented the testimonies of three (3) witnesses, namely: (1) Evelyn Bautista, the victimâs mother; (2) Ma. Theresa, the victim herself; and (3) Dr. Anabelle Soliman, a medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation. The prosecution established the following facts: Ma. Theresa Bautista
[2]
 is the eldest of four (4) children of accused-appellant and Evelyn Bautista.
[3]
 She has two sisters and a brother and they all reside in Pinalagad, Malinta, Valenzuela, Metro Manila. In February 1993, Evelyn left for Saudi Arabia where she worked as a domestic helper. While she was away, her children were left in the care of appellant and Evelynâs sister in Pinalagad, Malinta. Evelynâs stay in Saudi Arabia, however, was short-lived as she returned home in November 1993.
[4]
On January 19, 1994, Evelyn went on a vacation to her hometown in Ozamiz City in Mindanao. She took her youngest daughter with her, leaving her three children with appellant.
On the night of February 4, 1994, appellant and his three children were sleeping in the living room of their house in Pinalagad. The house was a one-room affair. They slept in a lined position with Theresa on one edge, appellant on the other edge with the two children sandwiched between them. They were all sleeping soundly when Theresa was suddenly awakened, sensing someone was lifting her body from the floor. Theresa saw that the person who lifted her was her father, herein appellant, and he was naked. Appellant laid Theresa down and removed her t-shirt and short pants. Theresa pushed him away and begged him â
Huwag po, ayoko po
!â â
Huwag kang magulo
!â he replied. Appellant reached out to the shelf beside the mirror and took the big bottle of baby oil nearby, poured oil on his hands, and rubbed it on his penis and on Theresaâs sex organ. Theresa was surprised but kept quiet. Appellant placed himself on top of the girl and inserted his penis into her vagina and made a push and pull movement. Theresa felt pain in her vagina. She pushed him away but could not move him because he was big. Appellant told her: â
Huwag kang malikot
!â Theresa kept still, scared that he might whip her as he had done in the past. Five to ten minutes later, appellant got up and put on his short pants. He also put Theresaâs clothes on her and went back to sleep.
[5]
The following day, February 5, 1994, Theresaâs mother, Evelyn, returned home from Mindanao. In the evening of the same day, appellant and his friends had a drinking session in his house. When he became drunk, appellant informed Evelyn that Theresa was always crying at night and he was worried that their neighbors might think he had wronged her. Evelyn was â
kinutuban
â because her husband had molested Theresa before.
[6]
 Theresa, then seven years of age, had told her mother that her father did something bad to her, but Evelyn refused to believe her.
[7]
 This time, Evelyn confronted Theresa who just bowed her head and cried. At Evelynâs insistent questioning, Theresa looked up and pointed to the bottle of baby oil by the mirror.  In between sobs, Theresa told her mother about her fatherâs dastardly act the night before. Forthwith, Evelyn called her sister and the following morning, they took Theresa to the police station to report the incident. Evelyn and Theresa gave their sworn statements to the police
[8]
 and appellant was arrested. The day after, Theresa was examined by Dr. Anabelle Soliman, the medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation.
[9]
Accused-appellant presented two (2) witnesses: himself and one Erlinda Caga. Appellant denied the charge.  He counters that the charge was fabricated by his wife after he discovered her illicit relations with another man. His wife was allegedly using their own daughter as an instrument to prevent him from digging further into her affair so she and her lover could continue their adulterous relations.
[10]
On January 31, 1994, he was at their house in Pinalagad when one Erlinda Caga came looking for his wife. Finding appellant instead, Erlinda informed him that Evelyn was having an affair with Erlindaâs husband, Leoncio; that the relationship started in Saudi Arabia where they worked under the same employer, and that Leoncio impregnated Evelyn, hence, the latter returned to the Philippines earlier than expected.
[11]
 To prove her claim, Erlinda showed appellant a love letter written by Evelyn addressed to Leoncio in Saudi Arabia which was forwarded to Erlinda in the Philippines.
[12]
 Erlinda also showed appellant two letters addressed to her, written and sent anonymously from Saudi Arabia informing her of her husbandâs illicit relations with Evelyn.
[13]
 One of the letters notified her that Evelyn was returning home in October or November 1993 and gave the latterâs address in Valenzuela.
Appellant photocopied the letters. When Evelyn arrived from Mindanao, he confronted her with the information and showed her the letters. Evelyn denied the accusation of infidelity and, angrily, tore the letters. On February 5, 1994, he was arrested by the Valenzuela police and the case of rape was filed against him.
On January 31, 1996, the trial court found accused-appellant guilty of the crime of statutory rape and sentenced him to death, viz:
âWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the prosecution having established by proof beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of STATUTORY RAPE punishable by Article 335 (1) of the Revised Penal Code, accused LEONARDO BAUTISTA y ADOCA is hereby found GUILTY as charged and is hereby sentenced to a penalty of death by electrocution and to indemnify the victim the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as damages.
Let the whole records of the case be forwarded to the Supreme Court for immediate review pursuant to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Section 22 of R.A. 7659.
SO ORDERED.â
[14]
Before us, accused-appellant raises the following issues:
â1. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN CREDITING THE TESTIMONIES  OF THE ALLEGED VICTIM AND THAT OF HER MOTHER;
2. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN SETTING ASIDE AS IMMATERIAL THE DEFENSE OF ILL-MOTIVE PUT UP BY ACCUSED-APPELLANT;
3. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN RELYING UNCONDITIONALLY UPON THE DOCTRINE CITED IN THE DECISION UNDER REVIEW;
4. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN DECLARING THE CRIME OF STATUTORY RAPE TO BE âPUNISHABLE BY ARTICLE 335 (1) OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE;â AND
5. WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN IMPOSING UPON ACCUSED-APPELLANT THE âPENALTY OF DEATH BY ELECTROCUTION.â
[15]
In reviewing rape cases, the court is guided by three settled principles: (1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove the charge and more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove it; (2) only two persons are usually involved in this crime for which reason the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with strictness; and (3) the prosecution evidence must stand or fall on its own merits; it cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.
[16]
In the instant case, appellantâs claims are mainly anchored on the insufficiency of the prosecution evidence. Appellant alleges that the trial court erred in upholding the prosecution evidence because the complainantâs testimony is incredible and full of inconsistencies and discrepancies.

When he turned on the light, sir.

A: 
 
Yes, sir.

A: 
 
He laid me down (inilapag niya ako).

A:
 
 
Tapos na po niya akong galawin.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
Now, you said earlier that you were raped. Before going to the word âraped,â you said you were raped by your father and you said âTapos na po niya akong galawin,â you mean that you had already been âginalawâ by your father before he turned on or switched on the light?
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
And how did you know that you were âginalawâ by your father and because you said that you were raped?
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
I felt that he placed himself on top of me.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
In other words, you were not awakened when you were lifted by......... Now, what is correct, you were awakened when you were bodily lifted by your father or you were awakened when he placed his body on top of you?
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
When he placed himself on top of me.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
And at that time, the light was not switched off [
sic
]?
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
Not yet, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
So, it must be dark inside your house?
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
Then during that darkness, how did you know that it was your father who was âgumalaw sa iyoâ or the person on top of you?
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
I felt, sir, that someone who [
sic
] was fat and has a beard.

I was naked also.

Who?

My father, sir.

A: 
 
Yes, sir.

A:
 
 
Yes, sir.

A: 
 
Pinagdidikit po niyang pilit.

Theresaâs foregoing testimony on direct examination was given on two separate occasionsâthe first was on October 28, 1994 and its continuation was on November 7, 1994. An examination of her testimony shows several inconsistencies. First, Theresa gave conflicting versions of how she was awakened from sleep. Initially, she said she awoke because she sensed she was being lifted by someone. In the same testimony that same day, she said she awoke because she felt her father on top of her. In the continuation of her direct examination, however, she said she was already awake before her father went on top of her because she was able to witness what he did with the baby oil.
Secondly, Theresa said that she knew the rapist was her father because she saw his face after he switched on the light. In the same testimony, she later said that she knew that the man on top of her was her father because he was fat and had a beard, just like appellant.
Thirdly, Theresa was not certain whether or not her father switched on the light. At first she said that appellant himself turned on the light after raping her and that she was surprised at seeing him naked. It is not clear whether the reason for her surprise was seeing appellant naked or realizing that her rapist was her own father because the âsurpriseâ came after she was raped. At the continuation of her direct examination, there was no switching on of the light and lifting of the girlâs body. Instead, appellant took the big bottle of Johnsonâs Baby Oil and applied some oil on his and his daughterâs private parts and then went on top of her and raped her.
These conflicting testimonies were not explained in the direct examination even when it was continued on another date. Neither were they clarified in the testimony of Evelyn, Theresaâs mother, nor were they discussed in the decision of the trial court. These discrepancies are material. The occurrence or non-occurrence of these facts did not happen separately from the rape itself. They involve sequence of events immediately preceding the victimâs story of defilement.  They erode her credibility.
More importantly, the victimâs account of penetration is not supported by the medico-legal report. Theresa was examined by Dr. Anabelle Soliman, the medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation. Dr. Solimanâs findings are as follows:
âGENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Height: 140 cm                                        Weight: 57 lbs.
Fairly nourished, conscious, coherent, cooperative, ambulatory subject. Breast, developing, conical, firm. Areolae, light brown, measures 2.5 cm in diameter. Nipples, light brown, protruding, measures 0.5 cm in diameter.
No extragenital physical injury noted.
GENITAL EXAMINATION:
Pubic hair, no growth. Labia majora and minora, coaptated.
Fourchette, tense. Vestibular mucosa, pinkish. Hymen, moderately thick, moderately wide, intact. Hymenal orifice, measures 1.5 cm in diameter. Vaginal walls and rugosities, cannot be reached by examining finger.
CONCLUSIONS: 
 
No evident sign of extragenital physical injury noted on the body of the subject at the time of examination.
Hymen intact and its orifice small (1.5 cm) as to preclude complete penetration of an average-sized adult male organ in full erection without producing hymenal injury.â
[19]
Dr. Soliman found no extragenital injuries on the girlâs body. She also found that Theresaâs hymen was âmoderately thick, moderately wide, intact.â The hymenal orifice measured 1.5 centimeters in diameter and was so small that the vaginal walls and rugosities could not even be reached by an examining finger which âpreclude[d] complete penetration of an average-sized adult male organ in full erection without producing hymenal injury." From these findings, it was concluded that there was no complete penetration of the vagina.
[20]
Theresa testified that she resisted her fatherâs lustful act but no extragenital injuries were found on her body. The girl also stated that appellant was able to penetrate her vagina because she felt pain in her organ. Theresaâs hymen, however, was found to be intact. The medical examination was made barely three days after the rape and yet there is nothing in the report that shows there was a tearing of the hymen or that a slight penetration of the vagina was made. The girl had a small hymenal orifice and appellant allegedly forced his penis into her vagina for some five to ten minutes. Yet there was no redness, contusion, discoloration, or any sign to prove that a forced penetration was at least attempted. Theresa revealed to Dr. Soliman she had been raped by appellant repeatedly since 1986.
[21]
 The doctor, however, did not find any healing or healed laceration in the girlâs organ.
[22]
 The examination was conducted for some 30 to 40 minutes;
[23]
 it was therefore more than superficial and cursory.
Dr. Soliman testified that although her findings did not show complete penetration of the vagina, she could not rule out  âpenetration of the labia.â
[24]
In rape cases, penetration of the vaginal orifice or rupture of the hymen is not necessary for rape to be consummated. What is important is that the penetration of the penis must be by entry thereof into the labia majora of the female organ.
[25]
 There must be penetration, no matter how slight, of the labia majora. Absent a showing of this entry, there can be no consummated rape; at most, it can only be attempted rape, or acts of lasciviousness.
[26]
In the case at bar, save for Theresaâs testimony, there is no other evidence showing that appellant was able to penetrate the girlâs labia majora. The testimony of Evelyn, Theresaâs mother, merely established the fact of marriage between her and appellant and that Theresa, the victim, is their eldest child. The rest of her testimony dwelt on events that occurred before and after the alleged rape.
A review of the evidence discloses that Theresaâs testimony can not pass the test of moral certainty. It is shot with inconsistencies and discrepancies material enough to cast doubt on its weight and sufficiency for conviction. Neither is her testimony adequate to convict appellant for the lesser degree of attempted rape or for the lesser crime of acts of lasciviousness. The inconsistencies do not involve the simple question of whether or not there was penetration of the labia majora to support a finding of consummated or attempted rape, or acts of lasciviousness. They go deep into the veracity and credibility of the victimâs testimony, raising the question of whether or not the act complained of actually occurred.
A conviction in a criminal case must be supported by proof beyond reasonable doubt, which means a moral certainty that the accused is guilty.
[27]
 It is possible that accused-appellant may have raped Theresa, but this court is not persuaded to the point of moral certainty. The defense may be weak, but the prosecution is weaker.
[28]
 The prosecution evidence has failed to establish and leave in our minds an abiding belief, based on reason and common sense, to a moral certainty of the truthfulness of the charge.
As a result of this finding, it is unnecessary to discuss the other issues raised by accused-appellant.
IN VIEW WHEREOF,
 the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela, Metro Manila, Branch 75 in Criminal Case No. 3889-V-94 is reversed and set aside, and accused-appellant Leonardo Bautista y Adoca is acquitted of the crime of statutory rape on the ground of reasonable doubt. It is ordered that he should be immediately released unless there be other valid cause for his continued detention. The Director of the Bureau of Corrections is further ordered to report to this Court the implementation of this decision.
SO ORDERED.
