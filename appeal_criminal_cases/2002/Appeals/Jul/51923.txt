PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE,
VS. MAXIMO SALVADOR, APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PER CURIAM:


This is an
automatic review of the Decision
[1]
 of the
Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 19, penned by Judge
Anthony E. Santos in Criminal Case No. 99-336 finding Maximo Salvador guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of qualified rape and imposing on him the supreme
penalty of death.


The Solicitor
General (OSG) narrates how appellant raped his own daughter:


âThe victim, Merlyn Salvador, is 14
years old and the legitimate child of appellant Maximo Salvador.


âAround 2 oâclock in the afternoon
of December 3, 1998, the victim heeded her fatherâs instruction to take a nap
inside their bedroom. But as she woke up later, she found herself already
naked. She was shocked when she saw her father embracing her. He pinned down
her hands while inserting his hard and erect penis into her vagina. He then
made pumping motions (TSN, September 15, 1999, pp. 33-35). At that very moment,
he looked like a âdevilâ to her. She tried to free herself from his embrace,
but he was so strong. She felt extreme pain when his penis penetrated her
vagina. After a while, she felt something wet that came out of his organ. The
incident happened inside the room where her other siblings were also sleeping
(TSN, September 15, 1999, pp. 36-37). After he had satisfied his lustful
desire, he warned her not to tell any one or he would cut her neck and those of
her mother and siblings (TSN, September 15, 1999, p. 37). He later burned her
panty which was stained with blood. Her mother, a market vendor, was not home
when the incident took place (TSN, September 15, 1999, p. 39).


âIn January 1999, he again tried to
abuse her. He was already on top of her, but later desisted when she shouted
for help. Thereafter, she left their house for she could no longer take the
abuses of her own father. She worked as a househelp but did not Inform her
family of her whereabouts. After sometime, she finally managed to reveal to her
Uncle Lando, her motherâs cousin, the sexual abuse she experienced in the hands
of her own father. She chose to tell her Uncle Lando, and not her mother
because she knew that her mother loved her father so much (TSN, September 15,
1999, pp. 26-41). Even then, her Uncle Lando also told her mother about It.
Together, she, her mother and her Uncle Lando reported the incident to the
authorities. The medical examination made on her reveals that she sustained old
healed lacerations at 4 oâclock and 8 oâclock positions (TSN, September 15,
1999, pp. 16-25).â
[2]


As a
consequence, on March 10, 1999, an Information docketed as Criminal Case No.
99-336 was filed, charging him as follows:


âThat sometime in December 3, 1998,
at 21st-20th Streets, Nazareth, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with the use
of force, threat and Intimidation, forced the offended party, Merlyn Salvador y
Candones, who is his 14 year old daughter to have carnal knowledge with him
knowing fully well that he is the father of the victim and the consummated
[sic] sexual assault was without the consent of his said daughter.â
[3]


During his
arraignment on May 6, 1999, appellant, assisted by his counsel de oficio Atty.
Cesar Merlas, pleaded not guilty to the above-quoted charge.
[4]
 Pre-trial
was held after which trial on the merits ensued. Appellant was subsequently
found guilty of rape in the Courtâs appealed Decision disposing thus:


âWherefore, accused Maximo Salvador
Is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of death, to indemnify Merlyn
Salvador the sum of 
P
75,000, to pay her moral damages of 
P
50,000
and to pay the costs.â
[5]


Appellant avers
that the prosecution failed to rebut the constitutional presumption of
innocence. He claims that the victimâs testimony on the rape incident was
incredulous because it defied the ordinary experience of man.
[6]
 As such,
the defects In the testimony should work towards his acquittal.
[7]
 He also
adds that the medical examination did not help the victimâs cause in any way,
not having conclusively shown that the old healed laceration in the vagina was
caused by penile penetration.
[8]


Thus, he assigns
the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:


âI


THE COURT
A QUO ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED NOTWITHSTANDING THE  FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS
GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.


âII


GRANTING
THAT ACCUSED IS GUILTY OF THE CRIME CHARGED, THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN IMPOSING
THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH INASMUCH AS THE RAPE IN THIS CASE IS NOT QUALIFIED
BY ANY CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE SAID PENALTY IS TO BE IMPOSED.â
[9]


The contentions
of appellant are not meritorious.


Appellant cannot
hide behind the constitutional presumption of innocence when, as in this case,
his guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Settled principles
enunciated in a long history of jurisprudence work against him. These, together
with the evidence adduced by the prosecution during the trial, affirm his
conviction.


In reviewing
rape cases, this Court has three guiding principles: (1) an accusation for rape
can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but even more difficult for
the person accused, though innocent, to disprove it; (2) in view of the
intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually
involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme
caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own
merit; the prosecution cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of
the evidence for the defense.
[10]


Corollary to
these is the principle that when a victim of rape says that she was defiled,
she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted
on her, and so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused
may be convicted on the basis thereof.
[11]
 This is a
basic rule, founded on reason and experience
[12]
 and
becomes even more apparent when the victim is a minor.
[13]
 In fact,
more compelling is the application of this doctrine when the culprit is her
close relative.
[14]


After
meticulously perusing the records and evaluating the evidence, the Court is
convinced beyond doubt of the credibility and the sufficiency of the
prosecution evidence establishing that appellant raped his own daughter. The
testimony of the victim is replete with details. She was positive, clear and
convincing during  the direct
examination and unwavering during the cross-examination. Her straightforward
testimony on her traumatic experience proceeded as follows:


âASST. FISCAL ADILAN: (To the
witness contâng.)

witness contâng.)


Q.

you vagina bleed?

blood.


Q.
   
For
how long was your father on top of you making a push and pull movement?

A.
    
No.
âNote: when the witness answered that question she [shook] her head.ââ
[15]


In evaluating
the credibility of witnesses, much weight and great respect are given to the
findings made by the trial court
[16]
 since it
had the unique opportunity to observe their demeanor on the stand and was, as
such, in a position to discern whether or not they were telling the truth.
[17]
 Needless
to say, its evaluation of their testimonies is binding upon the appellate court
in the absence of a clear showing that the trial judge reached such evaluation
arbitrarily or plainly overlooked certain facts of substance or value which, if
considered, might affect the result of the case.
[18]
 Appellant
has not given the Court sufficient reason to deviate from this doctrine.


To be sure, we
have on many occasions ruled that testimonies of child-victims of rape are to
be given full weight and credence.
[19]
 This is
because it is highly Improbable that a girl of tender years, one not yet
exposed to the ways of the world, would impute to any man, more so her own
father, a crime so serious as rape, if what she claims is not true.
[20]


The Court has
this to say of incestuous rape:


âIncestuous rape is not an ordinary
crime that can be easily Invented because of its heavy psychological and social
toll. On top of the humiliation of a trial and life-long stigmatization
resulting from the experience, the victims and their families must deal with a
crisis that goes to the very core of familial Integrity. We do not think a
daughter x x x would have sought the prosecution of her father and the
imposition on him of the supreme penalty of death had It not been for her
desire to seek justice.â
[21]


Courts usually
give greater weight to the testimony of the victim of a sexual assault,
especially a minor.
[22]
 No woman,
especially one so young, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an
examination of her private parts and thereafter pervert herself by being
subjected to the expense, the trouble and the inconvenience, not to mention the
trauma of a public trial, if she is not motivated solely by the desire to have
the culprit apprehended and punished.
[23]
 The
embarrassment or stigma she suffers in allowing an examination of her private
parts and testifying in open court on the painfully intimate details of her
ravishment effectively rules out the possibility of a false accusation of rape.
[24]
 When a
woman, especially a minor, says she has been raped, she says in effect all that
is necessary to prove that rape was committed.
[25]


Appellant harps
on the supposed untruthful testimony of the victim as it allegedly defied the
ordinary experience of man. According to him, it was unbelievable that during
the rape, he was embracing her, pinning down both her hands and Inserting his
penis into her vagina all at the same time. That to him was incredible. But as
correctly argued by the OSG:


âTruth to tell, however, the acts
of pinning down the hands of a rape victim, embracing and sexually assaulting
her are acts that are usually done simultaneously, If the offender had to
succeed in his criminal plot. The improbability of performing these acts all at
the same time is more Imagined than real.â
[26]


Also important,
minor discrepancies, if any, will not detract from the fact that complainant
categorically identified appellant as her assailant and vividly narrated the
sexual assault committed against her.
[27]
 Besides,
an error-free testimony cannot be expected from children, most especially when
they are recounting details of harrowing experiences, those that even adults
would rather bury in oblivion.
[28]

Complainantâs testimony may not be described as flawless, but its substance,
veracity and weight were hardly affected by the triviality of her alleged
inconsistencies. On the contrary, the supposed inconsistencies may have even
reinforced her credibility, as they had probably arisen from the innocence of a
child, confused and traumatized by the bestial act done upon her person.
[29]


Appellantâs
contention that the testimony of the medico-legal officer weakens the case against
him deserves scant consideration. He argues that Dr. Anabelle Murillo found in
the victimâs vagina an old healed laceration only, one that could have been
caused by the insertion of any hard object, possibly even by the girlâs own
finger or an activity like biking.
[30]


The findings of
Dr. Murillo that the victimâs private organ showed no recent lacerations but
only old and healed vaginal tearing cannot by itself be taken to mean
necessarily that the girl was not subjected to the crime, charged. Neither virginity
nor a finding of fresh vaginal lacerations would be essential in proving rape.
[31]
 True,
lacerations, whether healed or fresh, are physical evidence of a forcible
defloration.
[32]
 However,
there can be a finding of rape even if the medical examination shows no vaginal
laceration.
[33]


Further, in a
long line of cases, this Court has continued to hold that a medical examination
of the victim is not indispensable to a prosecution for rape.
[34]
 Just the
contrary, the Court has consistently ruled that the accused may be convicted
even solely on the basis of the complainantâs testimony if credible, natural,
convincing and consistent with human nature and the course of things.
[35]


Because the
victimâs testimony was shown to be credible,  natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal
course of things, appellantâs conviction must be affirmed. Also, this Court
finds no sufficient motive that might have impelled the girl to testify falsely
against her father or to implicate him falsely in the commission of such a
dastardly act.
[36]


As to
appellantâs alibi, we need not belabor this point. Settled is the rule that
such line of defense in a criminal trial cannot take precedence over the
positive testimony of the offended party.
[37]
 Unless
substantiated by clear and convincing proof, alibi is negative, self-serving,
and undeserving of any weight in law.
[38]
 In the
present case, appellant offered no evidence to prove or even corroborate his
alibi; as such, it cannot exculpate him from the crime charged.


Article 335 of
the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659, clearly provides that the death
penalty shall be imposed if the crime of rape is attended by, among others, the
following  circumstances:


âWhen the victim is under eighteen
(18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent,
guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree,
or the common-law-spouse of the parent of the victim;â


The minority of
the victim and her relationship with appellant were sufficiently alleged in the
information and later on proved during trial upon the presentation of evidence
by the prosecution. 


It has been
established that at the time of the rape, the victim was a minor, only fourteen
(14) years of age. This fact is amply supported by her baptismal certificate,
[39]
 which
shows that she was born on March 8, 1984. It is also confirmed by the testimony
[40]
 of her
mother; and by the girlâs school records, particularly the Report on Promotions.
[41]
 This same
document dated March 24,  1995, shows
that she was only eleven and one-half (11Â½) years old at that time. The
document also bolsters the fact that at the time of the rape on December 3,
1998, she was only fourteen (14) years old.


Relative to the
acceptability of a baptismal certificate and  school records as proofs of age, the Court has already ruled:


âThe birth certificate of the
victim or, in lieu thereof, any other documentary evidence, like a baptismal
certificate, school records and documents of similar nature, or credible
testimonial evidence, that can help establish the age of the victim should be
presented.â
 
[42]
 (Italics supplied)


This ruling has
been applied by the Court in subsequent cases.
[43]


At the same
time, the relationship between appellant and complainant was established by the
same baptismal certificate and the testimonies of the victim
[44]
 and her
mother.
[45]


On the other
hand, appellant did not present any evidence to refute these qualifying
allegations. In fact, he even admitted the minority
[46]
 of the
victim and his relationship to her.
[47]
 Hence,
the trial court correctly appreciated these circumstances.


In sum, we
affirm the Decision of the RTC finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt
of qualified rape and imposing the death penalty on him.
[48]

Indubitably, when the victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is a
parent, the court has no option but to apply the penalty of death.
[49]


Likewise, we
affirm the civil indemnity of 
P
75,000, since the crime of rape is
effectively qualified by circumstances under which the death penalty is
imposed. This indemnity is in addition to the award of moral damages in the
amount of 
P
50,000.
[50]
 As for
exemplary damages, an aggravating circumstance, whether ordinary or qualifying,
should entitle the offended party to an award of exemplary damages within the
unbridled meaning of Article 2230 of the Civil Code.
[51]
 There
being the aggravating circumstance of relationship in this case, the offended
party should receive exemplary damages in the amount of 
P
25,000.
[52]


WHEREFORE
, the decision of the RTC of Cagayan
de Oro  City (Branch 19) is AFFIRMED
with the MODIFICATION that appellant shall pay the victim Merlyn Salvador the
additional amount of 
P
25,000 as exemplary damages in addition to the
civil indemnity and the moral damages already awarded by the trial court.


In accordance
with Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659 amending Section 83 of the Revised
Penal Code, let the records of this case be forthwith forwarded, upon finality
of this decision, to the Office of the President for possible exercise of the
pardoning power.

that RA 7659, insofar as it prescribes the death penalty, is unconstitutional;
however, they submit to the ruling of the Court, by majority vote, that the law
