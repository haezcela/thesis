PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. BIENVENIDO DELA CRUZ, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




DAVIDE, JR., C.J.:


A man descends
into the depths of human debasement when he inflicts his lechery upon a minor,
and all the more when he imposes such lasciviousness upon a woman whose
capacity to give consent to a sexual union is diminished, if not totally
lacking.  Such is the case of Jonalyn
Yumang (hereafter JONALYN).


Upon a complaint
[1]
 dated 5 July 1996 signed by JONALYN
with the assistance of her aunt Carmelita Borja, two informations were filed by
the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor before the Regional Trial Court of
Malolos, Bulacan, charging Bienvenido Dela Cruz (hereafter BIENVENIDO) with
rape allegedly committed on 3 and 4 July 1996.  The informations were docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 1274-M-96 and
1275-M-96.  The accusatory portion of
the information docketed as Criminal Case No. 1275-M-96, which is the subject
of this appellate review, reads:


That on or about the 3
rd

day of July 1996, in the Municipality of Calumpit, Province of Bulacan,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused [Bienvenido dela Cruz @ Jun] did then and there wilfully,
unlawfully and feloniously with lewd design have carnal knowledge of one
Jonalyn Yumang y Banag, a mentally deficient female person, against her will
and without her consent.


Contrary to law.
[2]


Upon arraignment
on 14 October 1996, BIENVENIDO entered a plea of not guilty.
[3]
 The cases were consolidated, and joint
trial on the merits ensued thereafter.


When JONALYN was
presented as its first witness, the prosecution sought to obtain from the trial
court an order for the conduct of a psychiatric examination on her person to
determine her mental and psychological capability to testify in court.  The purpose was that should her mental
capacity be found to be below normal, the prosecution could propound leading
questions to JONALYN.  The defense,
through Atty. Jesus M. Pamintuan, vigorously opposed the prosecutionâs
manifestation.  Nonetheless, the trial
court allowed the prosecutor to conduct direct examination on JONALYN so that
if in its perception she would appear to be suffering from mental deficiency,
the prosecutor could be permitted to ask leading questions.  JONALYN was then made to identify her
signature in her sworn statement and to identify the accused, and was asked
about her personal circumstances. Thereafter, noticing that JONALYN had
difficulty in expressing herself, the trial court decided to suspend the
proceedings to give the prosecution sufficient time to confer with her.
[4]


At the next
hearing, the trial court allowed the prosecution to put on the witness stand
Dr. Cecilia Tuazon, Medical Officer III of the National Center for Mental
Health, Mandaluyong City.  Dr. Tuazon
testified that she conducted a psychiatric examination on JONALYN on 12 July
1996.  She found that JONALYN was
suffering from a moderate level of mental retardation and that although
chronologically the latter was already 20 years of age (at the time of the
examination), she had the mental age of an 8Â½-year-old child under the Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale.  Dr. Tuazon
also found that JONALYN could have attained a higher degree of intelligence if
not for the fact that she was unschooled and no proper motivation was employed
on her, and that she had the capacity to make her perception known to
others.  She, however, observed that she
had to âpromptâ JONALYN most of the time to elicit information on the sexual
harassment incident.  She then narrated
that JONALYN was able to relate to her that she (JONALYN) was approached by a
tall man named Jun-Jun who led her to a house that supposedly belonged to her
cousin, and that Jun-Jun disrobed JONALYN and raped her twice.
[5]


After said
testimony or on 11 March 1997, the trial court issued an order
[6]
 allowing leading questions to be
propounded to JONALYN in accordance with Section 10(c), Rule 132 of the Rules
on Evidence.
[7]
 Thus, JONALYN took the witness
stand.  She again identified her
signature and that of her aunt on her 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
.  She also identified BIENVENIDO as the person
against whom she filed a complaint for rape.  She declared in open court that BIENVENIDO raped her twice inside the
house of a certain Mhel located at Barangay Gatbuca, Calumpit, Bulacan.  She stated that BIENVENIDO placed himself on
top of her and inserted his private part into her womanhood.
[8]


Dr. Edgardo
Gueco, Chief and Medico-Legal Officer of the Philippine National Police Crime
Laboratory, Camp Olivas, Pampanga, testified that he examined JONALYN on 8 July
1996, and the results of the examination were indicated in his Medico-Legal
Report.
[9]
 He found that she was in âa
non-virgin state physically,â as her hymen bore deep fresh and healing
lacerations at 3, 8 and 11 oâclock positions.  He then opined that the hymenal lacerations were sustained a week before
the examination and, therefore, compatible with the time the rapes were
allegedly committed.
[10]


Carmelita Borja,
aunt of JONALYN, testified that on 5 July 1996, she accompanied JONALYN to the
Philippine National Police (PNP) Office in Calumpit, Bulacan, to lodge a
complaint against BIENVENIDO. With them were JONALYNâs mother Conchita Yuson
and Barangay Councilman Roberto Dungo. Carmelita testified that in instituting
this case, their family incurred expenses amounting to 
P
30,000.
[11]


After the
prosecution rested its case and formally offered its exhibits, the defense
filed a motion for leave of court to file a demurrer to evidence, which was
granted.  Thus, the defense filed on 5
December 1997 a Demurrer to Evidence
[12]
 on the following grounds:


(a) That the court had no
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the cases; and


(b) The presumption of accusedâs
innocence had not even [
sic
] been overcome by the prosecution due to the
insufficiency of  its evidence.


Expounding its
theory, the defense first admitted that it could have moved to quash the
information but it did not because the complaint on which the information was
based was on its face valid, it having been signed by JONALYN as the offended
party.  However, the undeniable truth is
that JONALYN had no capacity to sign the same considering her mental deficiency
or abnormality.  The assistance extended
to JONALYN by her aunt Carmelita Borja did not cure the defect, as the
enumeration in Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code of the persons who could
file a complaint for rape is exclusive and successive and the mother of JONALYN
was still very much alive.


The defense also
insisted on assailing the competency of JONALYN as a witness.  It claimed that JONALYNâs testimony,
considering her mental state, was coached and rehearsed. Worse, she was not
only asked leading questions but was fed legal and factual conclusions which
she was made to admit as her own when they were in fact those of the
prosecution.


In its Order of
26 January 1998,
[13]
 the trial court denied the Demurrer
to Evidence and set the dates for the presentation of the evidence for the
defense.  However, BIENVENIDO filed a Motion
for Judgment, stating in part as follows:


[A]fter
going over the Records â¦ and carefully analyzing the proceedings â¦ as well as
meticulously evaluating the evidence presented and offered [by] the private
complainant, in consultation with his parents, and assisted by undersigned
counsel, [he] had decided to submit â¦ the â¦cases for judgment without the need
of presenting any evidence to explain his terse PLEA OF NOT GUILTY to the
charges upon his arraignment.
[14]


Noting this new
development, the trial court, in its Order of 17 February 1998, considered the
case submitted for decision.
[15]


In its Joint
Decision of 3 April 1998, 
[16]
 the trial court convicted
BIENVENIDO of the crime of rape in Criminal Case No. 1275-M-96, but acquitted
him in Criminal Case No. 1274-M-96 for insufficiency of evidence. While
conceding that JONALYNâs narration of how she was sexually abused by BIENVENIDO
was not âdetailed,â the trial court, nonetheless, concluded that it was
candidly related by one who had the mental age of an 8-year-old child. The
trial court was convinced that JONALYN was able to show in her âown peculiar
wayâ that she was indeed raped by BIENVENIDO on 3 July 1996.  Finally, the trial court ruled that
BIENVENIDOâs culpability was further bolstered by his choice not to offer any
evidence for his defense despite ample opportunity to do so. Accordingly, it
sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay
JONALYN the amount of 
P
60,000 by way of civil indemnity.


In his
Appellantâs Brief,
[17]
 BIENVENIDO asserts that the trial
court committed the following errors:


1. ... in having taken the fatally
defective criminal complaint for a valid conferment upon it of jurisdiction to
try and dispose of said two (2) charges of rape.


2. ... in having accepted as
competent the mentally deficient private complainant even without first
requiring any evidence of her capacity as such a witness.


3. ... in having considered the
narration read to the complaining witness from prepared statements and asked of
her simply to confirm as true, as her own.


4. ... in having given full
credence and weight to complainantâs conclusions of facts merely put to her
mouth by leading questions of the prosecutor.


5. ... in having convicted the
accused-appellant in Criminal Case No. 1275-M-96, but acquitting in Criminal
Case No. 1274-M-96, on the basis of private complainantâs purported sworn
versions supposedly given in both charges.


BIENVENIDO
reiterates the issues he raised in his Demurrer to Evidence. He assails the
competency of JONALYN as signatory to the complaint she filed.  He adds that the defect in the complaint was
not cured by his failure to interpose a motion to quash nor by the assistance
lent by JONALYNâs aunt, which contravened Article 344 of the Revised Penal
Code. Consequently, BIENVENIDO asserts that the trial court had no jurisdiction
to try the case.


BIENVENIDO also
stresses the incompetency of JONALYN as a trial witness for the reason that the
prosecution failed to prove her competency. Further, JONALYN was merely asked
to affirm the legal and factual conclusions of the prosecution which evinced
quite clearly the girlâs lack of comprehension of the court proceedings and the
nature of her oath. Besides, her statements concerning the alleged sexual
penetration were elicited a month after her initial offer as a witness, which
reinforces the rehearsed and coached nature of her testimony.


Finally, he
wonders why he was convicted in Criminal Case No. 1275-M-96 but acquitted in
Criminal Case No. 1274-M-96 when it was a joint trial and the evidence was the
same.  He insists that he should also be
acquitted in the case at bar.


In the
Appelleeâs Brief,
[18]
 the Office of the Solicitor General
(OSG) counters that the trial court had jurisdiction over the case, since the
complaint and information filed were valid.  JONALYNâs mental retardation does not render her incompetent for
initiating the prosecution of the crime committed against her and for
testifying in court.  If minors are
allowed not only to initiate the prosecution of offenses under Article 344 of
the Revised Penal Code and Section 5, Rule 110 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal
Procedure, but also to testify under the Rules on Evidence, JONALYN, who had
the mentality of an 8-year-old child, was competent to sign the criminal
complaint and to be a witness in court.  JONALYNâs competency as a court witness was aptly proved when she was
able to answer the leading questions asked of her as allowed by Section 10(c),
Rule 132 of the Rules on Evidence. Moreover, the OSG asseverates that JONALYNâs
testimony on the fact of rape is corroborated by medical and physical
evidence.  As to BIENVENIDOâs quandary
that he should be acquitted also in this case, it is convinced that he should
have been convicted for two counts of rape, as JONALYN expressly testified that
she was raped twice by BIENVENIDO.  Finally, the OSG seeks an award of moral damages in the amount of 
P
50,000
for JONALYN, as well as a reduction of the award of civil indemnity to 
P
50,000
in conformity  with current
jurisprudence.


We shall discuss
the issues in 
seriatim
.


I.
            
Validity of the Complaint for Rape


We agree with
the disputation of the OSG that the trial court validly took cognizance of the
complaint filed by JONALYN. The pertinent laws existing at the time the crimes
were committed were Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code (prior to its
amendment by R.A. No. 8353
[19]
 otherwise known as âThe Anti-Rape
Law of 1997,â which took effect on 22 October 1997
[20]
) and Section 5 of Rule 110 of the
1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure.  Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code provides:


Article 344. 
Prosecution of the
crimes of adultery, concubinage, seduction, abduction, rape and acts of
lasciviousness
. -- â¦


â¦


The offenses of seduction, abduction,
rape or acts of lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint
filed by the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or guardian, nor, in
any case, if the offender has been expressly pardoned by the above-named
persons, as the case may be.
 


Section 5 of Rule 110 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure states:


Section 5. 
Who must prosecute
criminal actions
.âAll criminal actions either commenced by complaint or by information
shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of the fiscal.  However, in Municipal Trial Courts or
Municipal Circuit Trial Courts when there is no fiscal available, the offended
party, any peace officer or public officer charged with the enforcement of the
law violated may prosecute the case.  This authority ceases upon actual intervention of the fiscal or upon
elevation of the case to the Regional Trial Court.


â¦


The offenses of seduction,
abduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness shall not be prosecuted except upon a
complaint filed by the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or
guardian, nor, in any case, if the offender has been expressly pardoned by the
above-named persons, as the case may be.  In case the offended party dies or becomes incapacitated before she
could file the complaint and has no known parents, grandparents, or guardian,
the State shall initiate the criminal action in her behalf.


The offended party, even if she
were a minor, has the right to initiate the prosecution for the above offenses,
independently of her parents, grandparents or guardian, unless she is
incompetent or incapable of doing so upon grounds other than her minority.  Where the offended party who is a minor fails
to file the complaint, her parents, grandparents or guardian may file the
same.  The right to file the action
granted to the parents, grandparents or guardians shall be exclusive of all
other persons and shall be exercised successively in the order herein provided,
except as stated in the immediately preceding paragraph.


A complaint of
the offended party or her relatives is required in crimes against chastity out
of consideration for the offended woman and her family, who might prefer to
suffer the outrage in silence rather than go through with the scandal of a
public trial.  The law deems it the
wiser policy to let the aggrieved woman and her family decide whether to expose
to public view or to heated controversies in court the vices, fault, and disgraceful
acts occurring in the family.
[21]


It has been held
that â[w]hen it is said that the requirement in Article 344 (that there shall
be a complaint of the offended party or her relatives) is jurisdictional, what
is meant is that it is the complaint that starts the prosecutory proceeding.  It is not the complaint which confers
jurisdiction on the court to try the case.  The courtâs jurisdiction is vested in it by the Judiciary Law.â
[22]


The complaint in
the instant case has complied with the requirement under the Revised Penal Code
and the Rules of Criminal Procedure, which vest upon JONALYN, as the offended
party, the right to institute the criminal action.  As signed by JONALYN, the complaint started the prosecutory
proceeding. The assistance of JONALYNâs aunt, or even of her mother, was a
superfluity.  JONALYNâs signature alone
suffices to validate the complaint.


We agree with
the OSG that if a minor under the Rules of Court can file a complaint for rape
independently of her parents, JONALYN, then 20 years of age who was found to
have the mentality of an 8-year-old girl, could likewise file the complaint
independently of her relatives. Her complaint can be rightfully considered
filed by a minor.  


The overriding
intention of BIENVENIDO is to challenge the validity of the complaint by
assailing the competency of JONALYN to file the complaint. But even he admits
in his Demurrer to Evidence that the complaint is proper and valid on its face
for which reason he did not move to quash the information.  Thus, even he admits and recognizes the
futility of his argument.


II.
           
Competence of JONALYN to Testify


The
determination of the competence of witnesses to testify rests primarily with
the trial judge who sees them in the witness stand and observes their behavior
or their possession or lack of intelligence, as well as their understanding of
the obligation of an oath.
[23]


The prosecution
has proved JONALYNâs competency by the testimony of Dr. Tuazon.  The finding of the trial court, as supported
by the testimony of Dr. Tuazon that JONALYN had the understanding of an 8-year-old
child, does not obviate the fact of her competency.  Its only effect was to consider her testimony from the point of
view of an 8-year-old minor. Even a mental retardate is not, 
per se
,
disqualified from being a witness.
[24]
 JONALYN, who may be considered as a
mental retardate but with the ability to make her perceptions known to others,
is a competent witness under Section 20 of Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence.
[25]


JONALYNâs
competency is also better established in the answers she gave under direct examination
relative to the harrowing defilement she suffered in the hands of BIENVENIDO,
thus:


Q
     
And
the nature of your complaint was that you were abused or you were raped by the
herein accused Bienvenido de la Cruz y Santiago, is that correct?


A
      
Yes,
sir.


...


Q
     
And
do you know in what place where you raped by the accused, Bienvenido dela Cruz
y Santiago?


A
      
Inside
the house, sir.


Q
     
Whose
house?


A
      
In
the house of Mhel, sir.
[26]


â¦


Q
     
How
many times were you raped by the herein accused Bienvenido dela Cruz y Santiago
alias Jun Jun?


A
      
Twice,
sir.


Court: Where?


Fiscal: Where?


Witness: On top of the wooden bed,
sir.
[27]


Q
     
You
said you were raped twice by the herein accused, Bienvenido dela Cruz alias
Jun-Jun on a â
papag
â inside the house of Mhel at Barangay Gatbuca, Calumpit,
Bulacan, how did Jun Jun the herein accused rape[] you?


Court:
           
On the first time?


A
      
He
layed [
sic
] me to bed, sir.


Q
     
After
you were layed [
sic
] on the bed what happened next?


A
      
He
went on top of me, sir.
[28]


â¦


Q
     
Last
time, you stated that the herein accused whom you called âJunâ laid you on top
of a bed and after that, he went on top of you.  My question is, when he went on top of you, what did he do to
you, if any?


A:
     
Pumaloob
sa akin
.
[29]


â¦


Q
     
Now,
when the accused, which you called âJunâ, pumaloob sa iyo, what did you feel at
that time?


A
      
I
felt a hard object, sir.


Q
     
Now
since you said it [was] a hard object, you could now tell the Court, what that
hard object [was]?


â¦


A
      
I
cannot remember.
[30]


â¦


Public Prosecutor:


Q
     
When
you said the last time around, you were asked about, what you mean by âpumaloob
siya sa akinâ and then you said that there was a hard object inserted and after
that, the follow-up question was asked on you, you said you cannot remember,
what is that hard object, what do you mean when you say â I cannot remember? â


Atty. Pamintuan:


Leading.


Court:


Witness may
answer, subject to your objection.


Witness:


His private
part was inserted in my private part, sir.
[31]


â¦


Court:
           
But there was an answer a while ago.  Witness may answer.


Witness:


A
      
Yes,
sir.


Public Pros.:


Q
     
And,
when you say he did the same to you, he inserted his penis to your vagina?


A
      
Yes,
sir.


Public Pros.:


No further
question, Your Honor.
[32]


III.
          
Credibility of JONALYN as a Witness


The foregoing narrative
has established not only JONALYNâs competency but also her credibility.  Moreover, considering her feeble mind, she
could not have fabricated or concocted her charge against BIENVENIDO.  This conclusion is strengthened by the fact
that no improper motive was shown by the defense as to why JONALYN would file a
case or falsely testify against BIENVENIDO. A rape victimâs testimony as to who
abused her is credible where she has absolutely no motive to incriminate and
testify against the accused.
[33]
 It has been held that no woman,
especially one of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an
examination of her private parts, and thereafter permit herself to be subjected
to a public trial if she is not motivated solely by the desire to have the
culprit apprehended and punished.
[34]


We, therefore,
affirm the trial courtâs decision to lend full credence to the testimony of
JONALYN on the circumstances of the rape, thus:


In so few a word, complainant has
made herself clear about the sexual molestation she suffered in the hands of
the accused.  Plain and simple her
testimony may have been, unembellished, as it is, with details, yet, it is in
its simplicity that its credence is enhanced.  Certainly, we cannot expect complainant, in her present state of mind,
to come out with a full account of her misfortune with all its lurid
details.  That, to this Court, is simply
beyond the reach of her enfeebled mind.  She came to talk on her sad plight from the viewpoint of an 8-year-old
child, and she must, by all means, be understood in that light.
[35]


Absent any
cogent reason warranting a disturbance of the findings of the trial court on
the credibility and competency of JONALYN, this Court has to give these
findings utmost respect, if not complete affirmation. Settled is the rule that
the trial courtâs evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses is accorded the
highest respect, for it has an untrammeled opportunity to observe directly the
demeanor of witnesses on the stand and, thus, to determine whether they are telling
the truth.
[36]


IV.
         
Propriety of Propounding Leading
Questions to JONALYN


We likewise
agree with the trial courtâs conclusion that JONALYNâs testimony should be
taken and understood from the point of view of an 8-year-old child.  JONALYNâs testimony is consistent with the
straightforward and innocent testimony of a child. Thus, the prosecutionâs
persistent, repetitious and painstaking effort in asking leading questions was
necessary and indispensable in the interest of justice to draw out from
JONALYNâs lips the basic details of the grave crime committed against her by
BIENVENIDO.


The trial court
did not err in allowing leading questions to be propounded to JONALYN.  It is usual and proper for the court to
permit leading questions in conducting the examination of a witness who is
immature; aged and infirm; in bad physical condition; uneducated; ignorant of,
or unaccustomed to, court proceedings; inexperienced; unsophisticated;
feeble-minded; of sluggish mental equipment; confused and agitated; terrified; timid
or embarrassed while on the stand; lacking in comprehension of questions asked
or slow to understand; deaf and dumb; or unable to speak or understand the
English language or only imperfectly familiar therewith.
[37]


The leading questions
were neither conclusions of facts merely put into the mouth of JONALYN nor
prepared statements which she merely confirmed as true.  The questions were indeed carefully phrased
and sometimes based on her 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
 to make JONALYN understand
the import of the questions.  In the
same vein, the prosecutionâs referral to JONALYNâs 
Sinumpaang Salaysay

to refresh her memory was also reasonable. The purpose of refreshing the
recollection of a witness is to enable both the witness and her present
testimony to be put fairly and in their proper light before the court.
[38]


Thus, JONALYNâs
behavior merely conformed to Dr. Tuazonâs clinical and expert observation that
JONALYN had to be âcontinuously and repetitiously promptedâ so that she could
answer and recount a terrible experience. JONALYNâs constant eyeball fixature
towards her aunt and mother does not by itself indicate coaching, in the face
of a dearth of other evidentiary bases that the latter did coach her.  There was nothing in the behavior of JONALYN
which was indicative of her failure to understand the import of the trial
proceedings. Her identification of BIENVENIDO as her assailant is quite telling
on how simple, yet unassuming, her grasp of the situation was.  Thus:

you understand that this was explained to you, I would like to read to you
particularly question number 3.

V.
          
Sufficiency of Prosecutionâs Evidence


It is, therefore,
beyond doubt that JONALYNâs lone testimony, which was found to be credible by
the trial court, is enough to sustain a conviction.
[40]
 At any rate, medical and physical
evidence adequately corroborated JONALYNâs testimony.  Time and again we have held that the laceration of the hymen is a
telling, irrefutable and best physical evidence of forcible defloration.
[41]


On the basis of
the foregoing, we agree with the trial courtâs conviction of BIENVENIDO under
Criminal Case No. 1275-M-96. His acquittal under Criminal Case No. 1274-M-96
is, at this point, beyond  the review
powers of this Court.


Since the
information charges BIENVENIDO with simple rape only and no other modifying
circumstances has been proved, the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, which
is the lesser of the penalties prescribed by Article 335 of the Revised Penal
Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, was correctly imposed by the trial court.


We rectify the
error of the trial court in granting JONALYN the amount of 
P
60,000 as
civil indemnity. In conformity with current jurisprudence, we hereby reduce it
to 
P
50,000.
[42]
 An award of moral damages in the
amount of 
P
50,000 is also just under the circumstances.
[43]


WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Regional Trial
Court, Branch 11, Malolos, Bulacan, in Criminal Case No. 1275-M-96 finding
accused-appellant BIENVENIDO DELA CRUZ guilty of the crime of rape and
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
,
with the modification that accused-appellant is ordered to pay the victim
JONALYN YUMANG civil indemnity in the reduced amount of 
P
50,000 and
moral damages in the amount of 
P
50,000.
