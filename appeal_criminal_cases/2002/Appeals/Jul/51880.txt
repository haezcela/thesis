PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. FEDERICO ORBITA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PUNO, J.:


Accused-appellant
Federico Orbita y Retumba was charged with the crime of Rape in an Information
which reads, thus:


âThat on or about April 14, 1995,
in the Municipality of BiÃ±an, Province of Laguna, and within the jurisdiction
of this Honorable Court, accused Federico Orbita y Retumba, with lewd design
and by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully,
unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of said Marijoy Sumapang y
Tijano, against her will and consent, to her damage and prejudice.


CONTRARY TO LAW.â
[1]


On July 19,
1995, appellant Orbita pleaded "not guilty" to the crime charged.
[2]
 Prior to the initial presentation
of prosecution evidence or on October 17, 1995, appellant escaped from the
Laguna Provincial Jail. He was recaptured  on January 11, 1996 in Purok San Francisco, Barangay Red V, Lucena City.
[3]
 His trial was resumed.


The evidence
shows that at about 5:00 P.M. of April 14, 1995, Mayla Belasa learned from her
neighbors that Mary Joy was missing. Mayla and her sister boarded their sidecar
to look for her.
[4]
 When they passed by the house of
the accused, Mayla saw at its doorstep a pair of shoes similar to the one used
by Mary Joy. They went home and Mayla told her neighbor whom she fondly calls
Nanay Belen about the shoes. Nanay Belen immediately repaired to the house of
the accused where she found a red-faced Mary Joy and brought her home.
[5]


Meanwhile, the
neighbors fetched Mary Joy's mother, Lourdes, from the church. Nanay Belen told
her that Mary Joy was brought by the accused to his house. Mary Joy was crying
inside her bedroom, lying face down. Upon Lourdesâ inquiry, Mary Joy revealed
that the accused covered her mouth so she could not shout and then inserted his
organ inside her private part. She complained of pain in her private part.
There were bloodstains on her underwear.
[6]


Lourdes went to
Jojo Castillo, ex-President of the Homeowners Association of Adeline III,
BiÃ±an, Laguna who accompanied her to the house of the accused. Lourdes'
sister-in-law confronted the accused who admitted that he did something wrong
to Mary Joy. However, he said the wrong was not consummated. The accused was
brought to the BiÃ±an Police Station where he was investigated by SPO1 Bertito
Almenanza. The statements of the victim and the witnesses were taken.
[7]


On April 15,
1995, Mary Joy was examined by Dr. Rolando Poblete, then Municipal Health
Officer of Sta. Rosa, Laguna. His examination yielded the following results:


âMENTAL
STATUS:


Patient has a mental age of (10)
TEN years old.


MEDICO-GENITAL
EXAM:


GENITALIA - normal external genitalia; with very
slight bleeding (droplet) coming from the vaginal os; I.E. - laceration
(hymenal) at 6 o'clock and also at the right perihymenal area; admits 2 fingers
snuggly; cervix - close, hard, no bleeding nor tenderness noted; uterus is
small.


LMP - 3rd week March 1995.


Impression: There is an evidence of vaginal penetration.â
[8]


Mary Joy was
likewise examined by Dr. Diane Dijamco, resident physician of the National
Center for Mental Health (NCMH). A mental status examination was conducted by
Dr. Dijamco on the patient while the psychological examination was conducted
and evaluated by a psychologist.
[9]
 The results of the two (2)
examinations were then correlated by Dr. Dijamco as embodied in the Medical
Certificate
[10]
 dated November 14, 1995, the
pertinent portions of which state, 
viz
.:


âBRIEF
BACKGROUND HISTORY:


Patient is the 5th of (7) siblings
born to a retired OCW father and a plain housewife mother. She had apparently
normal growth and development until she developed Benign Febrile convulsions
which lasted until age 3. Consultations were made and she had several
hospitalizations. When she started schooling, she was noted to be a slow learner.
She only reached grade III after which she just (
sic
) stay home
occasionally helping out with the chores.


Owing to observed
"childish" behavior, a private physician was seen in 1991, was then
recommended confinement, with home medications of Chlorpromazine, Depresil and
AS-trivon, which were basically given in (
sic
) an irregular basis, or in
events when patient would start Headbanging and she was just tolerated at home.
She would only associate outside of the home during church services. 


MENTAL
STATUS EXAMINATIONS
:


Patient was seen and examined on 
(sic)

(3) separate dates October 16, and November 7, 1995.


Patient's a young adult female,
sthenic, short-statured and with shaggy-styled, shoulder-length hair. She was
seemingly behaved, cooperative to queries, had to be prodded every now and
then. She's unable to recall date and failed to explain why she was brought
here.


Patient related only a limited
account of self, abling to identify her companion, added that she helps out at
home with chores. She claimed to unimpaired sleep and appetite. Denied any
perceptual disturbances as well as morbid ideations. Mood's euthymic, affect
adequate.


On further interview, she had
difficulty comprehending cognitive function testing. When asked about head
banging episodes, she affirmed to this and claimed to an irrelevant
explanation.


As to case filed, she attested to
knowing the accused, but failed to narrate any specifics â âkaibigan ko lang
yon.â


Test judgment was poor, with an
insight into illness.


PSYCHOLOGICAL
EXAMINATION
:


Subject's mental functioning is
roughly estimated to be within the Mentally Retarded level Mild category; with
a mental age of 9 years and 3 months
.


Other tests production likewise
show that she is an individual whose intelligence belong to the mentally
retarded level
. Poor judgment and
reasoning power are noted. Generalized feelings of inadequacy and insecurity
are shown; although she was able to identify with her own sex, she showed along
heterosexual relationships is encountered. Some negativistic trends are also
noted which also brought about her difficulty in interpreting relationships.
Marked feelings of hostility is reflected. She has very shallow and affectless
contact with her environment.


Her ego functions are weak.

REMARKS
AND RECOMMENDATIONS
:


Based on the history, physical,
neurological, psychological and mental status examinations, patient was
assessed to be suffering from a mild form of mental retardation, with a mental
age of (9) years and (3) months
.


Her condition could be attributed
to a history of repeated seizures in childhood, resulting to the irreversible
condition.


As far as functioning is concerned,
she's only able to achieve minimal social and occupational skills which enables
her to do simple household tasks, with supervision.


In terms of academic performance,
she's not expected to perform beyond Grade VI course in level."
[11]


Accused
interposed the defense of denial. On the date and time of the incident, he
claims that he was cooking for dinner at his house with his relatives Jeffrey
de Leon and Jun Eugenio. At about 8:00 o'clock in the evening, a group of women
knocked on his door and asked who among them raped Mary Joy. He denied having
any knowledge of the crime but nonetheless went with them to the police
station.
[12]


On May 26, 1998,
the trial court rendered a Decision
[13]
 finding the appellant guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of rape under paragraph 2 of Article 335 of the
Revised Penal Code and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION
PERPETUA and to indemnify the victim the sum of 
P
50,000.00, to pay moral
damages in the amount of 
P
50,000.00 and the costs.
[14]
 Hence, the instant appeal.


Appellant raises
the following Assignment of Errors:


âI


THE TRIAL
COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN RENDERING A  DECISION WITHOUT EXPRESSING THEREIN CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY THE LAW ON
WHICH IT IS BASED.


II


THE TRIAL
COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT THE VICTIM IS A MENTAL RETARDATE.


III


THE TRIAL
COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF
THE CRIME OF RAPE.â
[15]


We affirm the
conviction of the accused-appellant.


In his first
assigned error, appellant argues that the decision of the court 
a quo 
violates
Article VIII, Section 14 of the Constitution which states that "no decision
shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and
distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based." The lower court
allegedly made generalizations without detailing the basis of its findings.
[16]


We hold that the
assailed decision substantially complied with the constitutional mandate of
Article VIII, Section 14 of the Constitution. The decision contains a summary
of the evidence for both the prosecution and the defense, findings of facts as
well as an application of case law. The decision states, thus:


â
Upon a careful study of the
entire records and evidence, this Court finds that there is no dispute that
Marijoy Sumagpang, a mental retardate, was raped.
 
At the time she was
sexually ravaged, Marijoy was twenty years of age albeit her mental state is
that of a nine year and three month old child
. The real issue then is
whether or not accused Federico Orbita raped her. 


x x x
                                         
x
x x
                                  
x x x


A review of the evidence convinces
the Court with moral certainty that Marijoy Sumagpang was sexually ravaged by
the accused. The victim Marijoy Sumagpang was unequivocal in stating that while
she was at the residence of the accused on April 14, 1995, the latter kissed
her on the lips, embraced her, removed her clothes and her panty, and
thereafter inserted his penis on (
sic
) her vagina. The ravishment of the
victim is confirmed by the report of Dr. Poblete that there was evidence of
vaginal penetration; that there was a slight bleeding (droplet) coming from the
vaginal os and that there was a hymenal laceration at 6:00 o'clock and also at
the right parihymenal, that is, on the sidings of the hymen.


It is a rule that (
sic
)
in rape cases that sexual intercourse with a woman who is deprived of reason
constitutes rape
 (People vs.
Estrebella, 124 SCRA 114). 
This is because while, as in this case, the woman
may be twenty years of age, her mental capacity is that of a nine year and
three month old child. Hence, she is incapable of giving consent to the sexual
intercourse.
 (People vs. Sunga, 137 SCRA 131). 
The necessity of proof
beyond reasonable doubt of force or intimidation having been applied is
absent.â
[17]
 
(
emphasis supplied
)


The purpose of
Article VIII, Section 14 of the Constitution is to inform the person reading
the decision, and especially the parties, of how it was reached by the court
after consideration of the pertinent facts and examination of the applicable
laws.
[18]
 The losing party is entitled to
know why he lost, so he may appeal to a higher court, if permitted, should he
believe that the decision should be reversed. A decision that does not clearly
and distinctly state the facts and the law on which it is based leaves the
parties in the dark as to how it was reached and is especially prejudicial to
the losing party, who is unable to pinpoint the possible errors of the court
for review by a higher tribunal.
[19]
 Thus, a decision is adequate if a
party desiring to appeal therefrom can assign errors against it.
[20]
 The accused-appellant cannot
pretend he is unable to understand the basis of his conviction for he was able
to assign specific errors against the trial court's decision and discuss them
intelligently.


We shall now
deal with the issue which, although not raised by the accused-appellant in his
Brief, was discussed by the Solicitor General in his Comment, i.e., whether the
accused-appellant, who is charged with rape under paragraph 1 of Article 335 of
the Revised Penal Code, may be convicted under paragraph 2 or 3 of the same
article even if the Information did not allege her mental state.


Article 335 of
the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, states:


âArt. 335. When and how rape is
committed. - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any
of the following circumstances:


1.
       
By
using force or intimidation;


2.
       
When
the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and


3.
       
When
the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.

x.â


The Information
against accused-appellant alleged that he had carnal knowledge of the victim by
means of force, violence and intimidation, against the latter's will and
consent.
[21]
 It did not allege her mental
state.  During the trial, however, the
prosecution proved that the victim is a mental retardate and the accused-appellant
was convicted under paragraph 2 of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.


Considering the
circumstances of the case at bar, we hold that the accused-appellant was
properly convicted under paragraph 2 of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.
To be sure, the issue is not novel. As well pointed out by the Office of the
Solicitor General in its Comment, 
viz
.:


âHowever, we submit that
accused-appellant has waived his constitutional right to be informed of the
accusation against him. During the trial, he did not register objection to the
introduction of any evidence that would prove complainant's mental condition
(see: People vs. Romua, 272 SCRA 818 [1997]; People vs. Tabao, 240 SCRA 758
[1995]; People vs. Tormentos, 211 SCRA 212 [1992]. His objection was against
the competency of the expert witnesses, Drs. Dijamco and Poblete, but not to
the admissibility of their testimonies on the ground that it would prove a
crime with which he was not charged. Moreover, while the Information did not
allege her mental condition, such fact appeared in the medical report (Rec., p.
6), request for medical examination (
ibid
., p. 7), and the affidavits of
Belen Payongayong (
ibid
., p. 8) and Lourdes Sumagpang (
ibid
., p.
11) which were attached to the complaint. In 
People vs. Rosare
 (264 SCRA
398 [1996]), it was held that even if the information filed did not allege that
the victim was a mental retardate, there was substantial compliance with the
constitutional mandate that an accused be informed of the nature of the charge
against him where the resolution issued by the investigating prosecutor, a copy
of which was attached to the information, clearly stated that the offended
party was suffering from mental retardation.


The separate opinion of Chief
Justice Davide in 
People v. Moreno
, (
supra
 at pp. 747-748) is
very appropriate:


â
I respectfully submit that
accused-appellant may be validly convicted of rape under either the second or
third circumstance provided for in Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, even
if the information has charged him only with rape under the first circumstance.


x x x
                                         
x
x x
                                  
x x
x.â


The complaint here contained
sufficient allegations showing that rape was committed under the first
circumstance of Article 335.


The evidence, however, established
that the victim was an imbecile with the mental age of a six-year old child.
The record does not disclose that appellant objected to the presentation and
offer by the prosecution of evidence of such fact. 
Appellant's failure to object
was thus a waiver of the constitutional right to be informed of the nature and
cause of the accusation. It is competent for a person to waive a right
guaranteed by the Constitution, and to consent to action which would be invalid
if taken against his will.
 (1 ARTURO M. TOLENTINO, CIVIL CODE OF THE
PHILIPPINES 31-32 [1983 ed.]). This Court has, on more than one occasion,
recognized waivers of constitutional rights, e.g., the right against
unreasonable searches and seizures (People v. Malasugui, 63 Phil. 221 [1936];
Viuda de Gracia v. Locsin, 65 Phil. 689 [1938]; the right to counsel and to
remain silent (People v. Royo, 114 SCRA 304 [1982]); the right to be heard
(Abriol v. Homeres, 84 Phil. 525 [1949]; People v. Dichoso, 96 SCRA 957 [1980]
and the right to bail (People v. Donato, 198 SCRA 130 [1991]). Reliance on 
US
v. Karelsen 
(3 Phil. 223 [1904] and 
People v. Mabag y Labado 
(98
SCRA 730 [1980] is inapposite for the former did not involve a conviction for
an offense other than that charged, accused was in fact charged with and
convicted of embezzlement; while in the latter, this Court sustained the
conviction of the accused under Article 335 although he was charged with having
violated Article 293 in relation to Paragraph 2 of Article 296 of the Revised
Penal Code. Neither is 
People v. Pailano
 (169 SCRA 649 [1989]) of any
persuasive import, for in fact, it did not totally discount a valid conviction
for rape under the second circumstance of Article 335 although the complaint
charged a violation of the first paragraph, in light of the failure on the part
of the accused to object to the evidence to support the second circumstance.
This Court noted there, thus:


It may be argued that although
initially deficient, the criminal complaint was deemed corrected when the
prosecution introduced evidence of the complainant's mental condition and the
defense did not object, thereby waiving the procedural defect. Even so, the
charge has not been adequately established.


In the first place, the doctor who
examined Anita reported that he saw no evidence of insanity on (
sic
) her
family history nor was there any indication of such condition in the
complainant herself. He did observe that age and the mentality of a
thirteen-year old, which was not that serious an impediment as her age at the
time was only fifteen.


Secondly, and more importantly, the
prosecution has not proved that during the encounter in the bushes, Anita's
mental condition was so weakened that she could not resist Pailano's supposed
advances.


Accordingly, appellant here can be
convicted of the crime charged through either the second or third circumstance
of committing such crime.


It is settled that an imbecile
or a retardate woman with a mental age below that of a woman less than twelve
(12) years of age is 
deprived of reason
 and carnal knowledge of her is
considered rape under the second circumstance of Article 335
 (People v. Gallano, 108 SCRA 405 [1981]; People v.
Sunga, 137 SCRA 130 [1985] 
or is of the same category as a woman under 12
years of age and carnal knowledge of her is deemed rape under the third
circumstance
 (People v. Manlapaz, 88 SCRA 704 [1979]; People v. Asturias,
134 SCRA 405 [1985]; People v. Race, 212 SCRA 90 [1992]. (
emphasis supplied
).ââ
[22]


The records show
that accused-appellant did not object to the manifestation made by the
prosecution that the complainant should first be examined to determine her
mental condition. He neither moved for reconsideration nor appealed the Order
of the trial court directing the National Center for Mental Health to conduct
the mental examination of the complainant.
[23]
 The accused-appellant likewise did
not oppose the prosecution's presentation and offer of evidence that would
prove complainant's mental condition. During the direct examination of the
complainant, the public prosecutor asked permission from the judge and was
allowed to propound leading questions in view of the complainant's mental
condition. There was no objection from the defense.
[24]


Prescinding from
these premises, the accused-appellant cannot complain that  he was denied due process when the trial
court convicted him of raping the complainant, a mental retardate, under an
Information that did not allege  her
mental state.  He had notice that the
prosecution would prove that the complainant had a mental age of a child below
ten (10).  He was given all the
opportunity to meet the evidence of the prosecution on the issue.  He could not say he was taken by surprise
and was not able to defend himself.  Indeed, he has never taken this posture.


Appellant, however,  contends that the prosecution failed to
prove that the complainant is indeed a mental retardate.  He alleges that the computed mental age of
the victim was made by a psychologist who was not presented in court and whose
testimony constitutes hearsay evidence.


In 
People vs.
Cartuano, Jr.,
[25]
 this Court explained the concept of
mental retardation, 
viz
:


âMental retardation is a clinical
diagnosis which requires demonstration of significant subaverage intellectual
performance (verified by standardized psychometric measurements); evidence of
an organic or clinical condition which affects an individual's intelligence;
and proof of maladaptive behavior. The degree of intellectual impairment must
be shown to be at least two (2) standard deviations (SD<2) below the mean
for age as confirmed by reliable standardized tests such as the Stanford Binet
Test and the Weschler Intelligence Tests. Non-standardized, non-parametric
tests, such as the Denver Development Screening Tests or non-standardized,
non-specific "quick" tests such as sentence completion tests and the
Goodenough Drawing Test are unreliable.


In making a diagnosis of mental
retardation, a thorough evaluation based on history, physical and laboratory
examination made by a clinician is necessary. The reason for this universal
requirement is well-explained in both the medical and clinical psychology
literature: mental retardation is a recognized clinical syndrome usually
traceable to an organic cause, which determinants are complex and
multifactorial. As the boundaries between normality and retardation are
difficult to delineate, proper identification requires competent clinical
evaluation of psychometric parameters in conjunction with medical and
laboratory tests.


x x x
                                         
x
x x
                                  
x x
x.â


x x x It is held in the most recent
of the Medical, Psychiatric, and General and Clinical Psychology literature on
mental retardation and deficiency here and abroad, that 
  identification of mentally deficient subjects
cannot be left to ambiguous social notions and assumptions alone, such markers
being unfortunately vague, sometimes discriminatory and widely open to chance.

The proper clinical determination of mental deficiency requires several legs.
Needless to say, after psychometric diagnosis utilizing the proper tests has
been confirmed, a comprehensive medical evaluation, (all reasonably within the
capacity (
sic
) major provincial and city hospitals and centers) is
necessary to complete the process.


It is necesary to stress here,
conformably with what the Court has been saying in jurisprudence on the matter,
that 
deprivation of reason need not be complete. Mental abnormality or
deficiency is enough
. However, abnormality or deficiency of whatever state
or degree should be sufficiently and adequately established by orthodox and
reasonably available methods and procedures. It is possible that complainant
could well have been on the lower end of the acceptable mean for her age group,
a condition which would have been aggravated by her lack of education, but
this, by any medical or psychological yardstick, does not itself negate
autonomous choice or decision-making based on reasoning.â
[26]


A circumspect
consideration of the evidence will show that the mental condition of the
complainant was sufficiently established. Dr. Dijamco, a psychiatrist,
testified that she conducted a mental status examination of the complainant.
She interviewed the complainant and evaluated her mental capacity. In the
course of her examination, she found out that the complainant  has difficulty in recalling events and in
identifying people.
[27]
 The medications prescribed and
taken by the complainant in her childhood days, namely chlorpromazine, depresil
and AS-trivon, are anti-psychotic or for disturbance in thoughts or insanity.
[28]
 Dr. Dijamco correlated the
conclusions made by the psychologist to her own findings.


The expert
opinion of Dr. Dijamco was corroborated by the other prosecution witnesses. Dr.
Poblete testified that based on his conversations with the complainant, the
latter's mental age is up to ten (10) years old which is not compatible with
her chronologic age.
[29]


Complainant's
mother, Lourdes, likewise recounted that when Mary Joy was three (3) years old,
they consulted a doctor who diagnosed her daughter's mental state as delayed.
Thereafter, Mary Joy continued to see a doctor at the mental hospital.
[30]


Another
prosecution witness, Mayla Belasa, described complainant as âisip- bata.â
[31]


The testimony of
the complainant herself proves her mental condition. She had extreme difficulty
in understanding the questions propounded to her. Most of her answers were not
responsive or too far-off. She could not even remember her birthday, address
and the name of her English teacher.
[32]


The sum total of
these testimonial and documentary evidence proves beyond doubt that the
complainant is a mental retardate at the time she was raped by the
accused-appellant.


In his third
assigned error, accused-appellant contends that he cannot be convicted of rape
considering the testimony of complainant herself that accused-appellant is her
boyfriend and that she voluntarily offered herself to him.
[33]
 Accused-appellant's argument cannot
be sustained. It is well-entrenched in jurisprudence that a mentally retarded
victim is incapable of giving a valid consent to the sexual act.
[34]
 She is in the same class as a woman
deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious
[35]
 or as a child below 12 years of
age.
[36]
 Carnal knowledge of a woman who is
so weak in intellect to the extent that she is  incapable of legally consenting constitutes rape.
[37]
 In 
People vs. Antonio
,
[38]
 we ruled that:


âWe have held that if the mental
age of a woman above twelve years is that of a child below twelve years, even
if she voluntarily submitted to the bestial desires of the accused, or even if
the circumstances of force or intimidation, or of the victim being deprived of
reason or otherwise unconscious are absent, the accused would still be liable
for rape under the third paragraph of Article 335. The rationale for this is
that if sexual intercourse with a victim under twelve years of age is rape,
then it should follow that carnal knowledge of a woman whose mental age is that
of a child below twelve years would also constitute rape.â
[39]


We also reject
accused-appellant's contention that the case at bar was filed against him because
his neighbors found him boastful and proud. It is unthinkable that a mother
would expose her daughter's misfortune to the public just to please their
neighbors who find accused-appellant boastful.


Accused-appellant's
defense of denial merits scant consideration. The plea of denial is viewed with
disfavor by courts due to the facility with which it can be concocted.
[40]
 While he testified that he was with
his three (3) housemates cooking dinner when the crime was committed, the said
persons were never presented in court to corroborate his testimony.
Unsubstantiated denials merit no weight in law and cannot be given greater
evidentiary value over the testimony of credible witnesses who testified on
affirmative matters.
[41]


Finally, the act
of accused-appellant in escaping from prison during the pendency of the case is
hardly consistent with his plea of innocence. Unless explained, the act of
fleeing shows a consciousness of guilt and operates as an admission implied
from the party's own conduct. As the Good Book says, the wicked fleeth when no
man pursueth, but the righteous are bold as a lion.
