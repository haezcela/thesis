 ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.

 Before appellant was arraigned, a motion to quash was filed on the ground that the Informations charged more than one offense. The prosecution opted to amend the Informations by deleting the phrase "and for several similar occasions thereafter," which the court granted. 
 On March 25, 2004, appellant, assisted by counsel, was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to all rape charges. During pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the identities of the parties, the fact that the birth certificate
[7]
 shows that BBB is the daughter of appellant and a minor at the time of the alleged rape incidents. Joint trial of the cases followed.
 In Criminal Case No. RTC-2003-0294, the incident of rape through sexual assault happened in April 1998 when BBB was only 11 years old. While sleeping with her mother and appellant in the sala of their house, BBB was awakened by someone rubbing her back. BBB did not recognize appellant at first because it was dark until he threatened her with a knife and told her not to make any noise. Appellant then forcibly removed BBB's shorts and panty, and inserted his finger into her genital, causing her to feel pain. Appellant also lifted BBB's shirt, held her breasts and molested her for an hour, during which she only cried. 
 In Criminal Case No. RTC-2003-0295, the incident rape through carnal knowledge occurred in March 1999 when BBB was 13 years old. While BBB was alone in their house watching TV, appellant told her to get inside the room, but she refused. Appellant got mad, slapped her face and dragged her inside the room. He then removed her shorts, slapped her again and covered her mouth when she tried to shout for help. After removing her bra and panty, appellant laid BBB on the bed, held her breasts and inserted his penis in her vagina, causing her to feel severe pain. BBB kept mum about the incident as she was afraid that he might kill her.
 In Criminal Case No. RTC-2003-0296, the other incident of rape through carnal knowledge took place on March 30, 2003 when BBB was already 16 years old. Only appellant and BBB were at home that day since her mother and siblings went to Naga City. At about 8:00 p.m., BBB was preparing her beddings in their sala when appellant told her to undress herself. Since appellant threated to kill her, BBB obeyed, Appellant also undressed himself, held BBB's breasts, kissed her and inserted his penis into her vagina for an hour. 
 When BBB's mother learned of the rape incidents, she accompanied BBB at NBI Naga City to file a complaint against appellant. Dr. Jane Fajardo conducted a medico-legal examination and came up with these findings: (1) old, deep, but healed hymenal lacerations at the 6 and 9 o'clock positions, (2) the edges are round and coaptible, and; (3) the hymenal orifice measures 2.5 cms. as to allow complete penetration by an average-sized adult Filipino male organ in full erection without producing hymenal injury. 
 Appellant denied all the rape charges against him for the following reasons: (1) after his wife gave birth on April 13, 1998, the lights in their bedroom were turned on all night; (2) in the summer of 1999, all his children stayed home all the time for no one among them took summer classes, and he was busy taking care of his one-year-old daughter; (3) in September 2002, he only required her daughter BBB to take a urine test because he learned that she missed her period.
[8]
 He dismissed the allegations against him as a mere fabrication of his wife's relatives who were against their marriage. He also claimed that BBB allowed herself to be part of such malicious scheme, as she was angry at him for having slapped and hurt her when he learned that she has a boyfriend and she missed two menstruation periods. He also denied having caused the abortion of BBB's baby in Manila, but admitted that he went there with BBB to visit his sister Rebecca who had arrived from the United States. 
 On July 19, 2011, the RTC rendered a judgment, convicting appellant of one (1) count of rape by sexual assault and two (2) counts of rape by sexual intercourse, thus: 
 
 
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the judgment is hereby rendered finding accused 
Raul Macapagal y Manalo 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, on two counts, through 
sexual intercourse 
and one count of rape through 
sexual assault
. 
 
 As regards rape through 
sexual intercourse
, accused is hereby sentenced to suffer 
Reclusion Perpetua
 for each count without eligibility for parole and to pay the offended party civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00, moral damages of P75,000.00 and exemplary damages of P30,000.00, in each of the two cases. 
 
 As regards the rape committed through 
sexual assault
, accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment often (10) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum, and to indemnify the offended party civil indemnity of P30,000.00, moral damages of P30,000.00 and exemplary damages of P15,000.00. 
 
 
SO ORDERED.
[9]
 
 
 
 The RTC found BBB's testimony credible as she was able to narrate clearly and unwaveringly how each of the rape incidents was done to her by appellant, her very own father, despite rigid cross-examinations conducted by the defense. The RTC noted that the genital examination conducted on BBB, showing the presence of old hymenal lacerations, is consistent with the finding of previous sexual intercourse. 
 With respect to appellant's defenses, the RTC held that his lame excuses of presence of other family members, lights turned on overnight and open bedroom door during the rape incidents, cannot prevail over the categorical narration of BBB of her defloration in the hands of appellant. As to the claim that BBB was angry at appellant as she suffered severe bruises when appellant learned that she was impregnated by her boyfriend, the RTC pointed out that he failed to prove that BBB indeed had a boyfriend that time. The RTC was also not impressed by appellant's claim that the malicious accusations against him are orchestrated by the family of his wife, considering that his in-laws even gave his family material and financial support. Anent the delay in the reporting of the incidents, the RTC found the same as justified in view of appellant's constant showing of his knife to BBB, and his verbal threat upon her while she was being raped to the effect that he would kill her should she tell anyone about the incidents. Although BBB cannot state precisely the dates of the rape incidents, the RTC stressed that the supposed inconsistencies merely refer to minor details, which have no effect on her credibility, and that the exact dates of the commission of the crime are not the element of the offense. 
 Aggrieved by the RTC judgment, appellant, through the Public Attorney's Office, filed an appeal. Appellant argued that while the last rape incident as testified to by BBB happened on March 30, 2003, the hymenal lacerations diagnosed by Medico-Legal Officer Dr. Jane Fajardo on April 3, 2003 are old and healed lacerations which were inflicted more than a month or a year before. Faulting BBB's credibility, appellant contended that not only did she tell anyone about the rape incident, she also tolerated similar incidences for the past five (5) years from April 1998 to April 3, 2004, which is rather odd because there were times when she was only with her mother at the clinic. Assuming that she was raped by her father, appellant claimed that BBB could have found solace in a safe house or in government institutions rendering social services for rape victims. 
 The Office of the Solicitor General insisted that appellant's guilt for the crimes charged had been proven beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution's testimonial and documentary evidence. 
 On August 8, 2014, the CA rendered a Decision affirming the RTC judgment with modification on the damages awarded: 
 
 
WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the Decision dated July 19, 2011 of the Regional Trial Court of Naga City, Branch 20, is hereby 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
, to read as follows: 
 
 
 1. In Criminal Case No. RTC-2003-0294, appellant Raul Macapagal is hereby held GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape Through Sexual Assault and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the Indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of Ten (10) years and one (1) day of
 prision mayor
, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal,
 as maximum, and to indemnify the offended party civil indemnity of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00), moral damages of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) and exemplary damages of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00); 
 
 2. In Criminal Case No. RTC Nos. 2003-0295 and 2003-0296, appellant Raul Macapagal is hereby held GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Rape Through Sexual Intercourse and that, for each count, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 without eligibility for parole, and ordered to pay the private offended party civil indemnity in the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00), moral damages also in the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00), and exemplary damages in the amount of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00); 
 
 3. Appellant Raul Macapagal is further ordered to pay the private offended party interest on all damages awarded at the legal rate of Six Percent (6%) per annum until the same are fully paid. 
 
 
 SO ORDERED.

 The CA agreed with the RTC that BBB's testimony is credible, as she was firm and unwavering in her narration of her traumatic experience during the rape incidents perpetrated by her own father. The CA also ruled that the medical report and the testimony of the medico-legal officer on BBB's deep and healed hymenal lacerations are consistent with BBB's allegations of rape against appellant. The CA observed that prior to the last rape incident, BBB had been victimized by appellant to countless sexual abuses which started in 1998, which explains the healed lacerations in BBB's genitals. The CA noted that BBB initially preferred to conceal her dishonor because the culprit was her own flesh and blood, who even threatened her life should she report the rape incidents to anyone. With respect to the inconsistencies pointed out by appellant, the CA ruled that they even tend to bolster her credibility as they are proofs of an unrehearsed testimony. Anent the claim that BBB could have avoided the rape incident by finding solace in a safe house or in a government institution, the CA stressed that BBB could hardly be expected to know what to do under such circumstances as she was only 11 years old when the first rape incident took place. The CA also ruled that it is unnatural for grandparents to use their grandchild in a scheme of malice against her own father, not to mention that it will subject the child to embarrassment and stigma.
 Dissatisfied with the CA Decision, appellant filed a notice of appeal. 
 The appeal is devoid of merit. 
 After a careful review of the records, the Court finds no reason to reverse the RTC's judgment of conviction, but a modification of the penalty imposed, the damages awarded, and the nomenclature of the offense committed, are in order. 
 In Criminal Case No. RTC-2003-0294, appellant should be held liable for acts of lasciviousness under Art. 336
[11]
 of the RPC, in relation to Section(b), Art. III of R.A. No. 7610
[12]
 instead of rape through sexual assault under Art. 266-A, paragraph 2 of the RPC.
[13]
 
 In 
Dimakuta v. People
,
[14]
 the Court stressed that in instances where the lascivious conduct is covered by the definition under R.A. No. 7610, where the penalty is
 reclusion temporal
 medium, and the act is likewise covered by sexual assault under Art. 266-A, paragraph 2 of the RPC, which is punishable by 
prision mayor
, the offender should be liable for violation of Section 5 (b), Art. III of R.A. No. 7610, where the law provides for the higher penalty of 
reclusion temporal 
medium, if the offended party is a child victim. But if the victim is at least eighteen (18) years of age, the offender should be liable under Art. 266-A, par. 2 of the RPC and not R.A. 7610, unless the victim is at least 18 years old and she is unable to fully take care of herself or protect herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition, in which case, the offender may still be held liable of sexual abuse under R.A. No. 7610. The reason for the foregoing is that, aside from the affording special protection and stronger deterrence against child abuse, R.A. No. 7610 is a special law which should clearly prevail over R.A. 8353, which is a mere general law amending the RPC.
[15]
 
 In 
People v. Chingh
,
[16]
 the Court noted that "it was not the intention of the framers of R.A. No. 8353 to have disallowed the applicability of R.A. No. 7610 to sexual abuses committed to children. Despite the passage of R.A. No. 8353, R.A. No. 7610 is still good law, which must be applied when the victims are children or those 'persons below eighteen (18) years of age or those over but are unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition."' 
 In 
People v. Noel Go Caoili
,
[17]
 the Court prescribed guidelines in designating or charging the proper offense in case lascivious conduct is committed under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, and in determining the imposable penalty. "If the victim of lascivious conduct is under twelve (12) years of age, the nomenclature of the crime should be 'Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610' and pursuant to the second 
proviso
 thereof, the imposable penalty is 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period." In this case, it was alleged in the information, stipulated during pre-trial and indicated in her birth certificate
[18]
 that BBB was 11 years old at the time of the commission of the crime charged in Criminal Case No. RTC-2003-0294. 
 However, before an accused can be held criminally liable for lascivious conduct under Section 5(b), Art. III of R.A. No. 7610, the Court held in 
Quimvel v. People
[19]
 that the requisites of acts of lasciviousness as penalized under Art. 336 of the RPC must be met in addition to the requisites for sexual abuse under Section 5(b), Art. III of R.A. No. 7610, namely: 
 
 1. The offender commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness; 
 2. That it be done under any of the following circumstances: 
 
 
a. Through force, threat, or intimidation;
 b. When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; 
 c. By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; 
 d. When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present; 
 
 
3. That said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and
 4. That the offended party is a child, whether male or female, below 18 years of age. 
 
 
 Regarding the first requisite, intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia of any person, with intent to abuse or gratify sexual desire falls under the definition of "lascivious conduct"
[20]
 under Section 2 (h) of the rules and regulations of R.A. No. 7610. With respect to the second requisite, "force and intimidation" is said to be subsumed under "coercion and influence" and such terms are used almost synonymously.
[21]
 This can be gleaned from Black's Law Dictionary definitions of "
coercion
" as "
compulsion; force; duress
", of "
influence
" as '
'persuasion carried over to the point of overpowering the will
â, and of "
force
" as "
constraining power, compulsion; strength directed to an end
"; as well as from jurisprudence which defines "
intimidation
" as "
unlawful coercion; extortion; duress; putting in fear
".
[22]
 Anent the third requisite, a child is deemed exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse when the child indulges in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct (a) for money, profit or any other consideration; or (b) under the coercion or any influence of any adult, syndicate or group.
[23]
 As for the fourth requisite, "children" refers to a person below eighteen (18) years of age or those over but are unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition.
[24]
 
 All the elements of acts of lasciviousness under Art. 336 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5(b), Art. III of R.A. No. 7610, were established by the prosecution through the credible testimony of BBB to the effect that appellant, her father, showed a knife and threatened to kill her should she make any noise, then forcibly removed her shorts and panty, and inserted his finger in her vagina, causing her to feel pain. 
 As the trial court aptly observed, BBB was able to describe how each of the rape incidents was done to her by her father, and her narration of the incidents were clear and detailed as she was able to clearly and unwaveringly narrate her ordeal in the hands of her very own father, thus:

[25]
 
 
 
 With respect to Criminal Cases Nos. RTC-2003-0295 and RTC-2003-0296, the prosecution was, likewise, able to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of qualified rape as defined under paragraph 1, Art. 266-A
[26]
 and penalized under paragraph 1, Art. 266-B
[27]
 of the RPC, as amended, namely: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under 18 years of age at the time of the rape; (5) the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
[28]
 
 Through the categorical and consistent testimony of BBB, the prosecution established that appellant, her father, threatened to kill and undressed her, then inserted his penis in her vagina for about an hour, sometime in the summer of 1999 and on March 30, 2003, to wit:

In cases of offended parties who are young and immature girls, there is considerable receptivity on the part of the courts to lend credence to their testimonies, considering not only their relative vulnerability, but also the shame and embarrassment to which such a grueling experience as a court trial, where they are called upon to lay bare what perhaps should be shrouded in secrecy, did expose them to.
[30]
 Indeed, no woman, much less a child, would willingly submit herself to the rigors, the humiliation and the stigma attendant upon the prosecution of rape, if she were not motivated by an earnest desire to put the culprit behind bars.
[31]
 Hence, BBB's testimony is entitled to full faith and credence. 
 All the arguments and issues raised in the appellant's brief â which the Public Attorney's Office adopted instead of filing a supplemental appeal brief
[32]
 â have been properly addressed in full and in detail in the appealed CA decision. Appellant's denial is a self-serving defense that cannot be given greater weight than the declaration of a credible witness, like BBB, who testified on affirmative matters
[33]
 and positively identified her father as the perpetrator of the crimes charged.
When the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally binding upon the Court, unless there is a clear showing that they were reached arbitrarily or it appears from the records that certain facts of weight, substance, or value are overlooked, misapprehended or misappreciated by the lower court which, if properly considered, would alter the result of the case.
[34]
 After a circumspect study of the records, the Court sees no compelling reason to depart from the foregoing principle. 
 As to the penalty for the crime charged in Criminal Case No. RTC 2003-0294, considering that BBB was under 12 years old when appellant threatened her with a knife, forcibly removed her shorts and panty, and inserted his finger into her vagina on April 13, 1998, the imposable penalty for acts of lasciviousness under Art. 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b), Art. III of R.A. No. 7610, is 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period which ranges from Fourteen (14) years, Eight (8) months and One (1) day to Seventeen (17) years and Four (4) months. Since the perpetrator of the offense is the father of the victim, and such alternative circumstance of relationship was alleged in the Information and proven during trial, the same should be considered as an aggravating circumstance for the purpose of increasing the period of the imposable penalty. There being no mitigating circumstance to offset the said alternative aggravating circumstance, the penalty provided shall be imposed in its maximum period. This is also in consonance with Section 31(c),
[35]
 Art. XII of R.A. No. 7610. Accordingly, appellant should be sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of Fourteen (14) years and Eight (8) months of 
reclusion temporal
 in its minimum period, as minimum, to Seventeen (17) years and Four (4) months of 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period, as maximum. A fine in the amount of P15,000.00 should also be imposed upon appellant in accordance with Section 31(f),
[36]
 Art. XII of the same law. The award of civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00 each is reduced to P20,000.00 for civil indemnity, and to P15,000.00 each for moral and exemplary damages, in line with 
Quimvel v. People
.
[37]
 
 On the other hand, in Criminal Case Nos. RTC 2003-0295 and RTC 2003-0296, the imposable penalty for the two (2) counts of qualified rape under Art. 266-A(1)(d), in relation to Art. 266-B(1) of the RPC, is death. However, in view of R.A. No. 9346
[38]
 and A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC,
[39]
 the CA properly sustained the RTC in imposing the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 without eligibility for parole 
in lieu 
of death. In light of recent jurisprudence
[40]
 where it was held that in cases of qualified rape where the imposable penalty is death but the same is reduced to
 reclusion perpetua
 because of R.A. No. 9346, the award of civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages should be increased from P75,000.00 to P100,000.00.
[41]
