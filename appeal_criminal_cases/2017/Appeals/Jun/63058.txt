PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. HENRY BENTAYO, APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




PERALTA, J.:


For consideration of this Court is the appeal of the Decision dated November 14, 2014 of the Court of Appeals (
CA
) dismissing appellant Henry Bentayo's appeal and affirming the Judgment dated September 2, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 20, Tacurong City in Criminal Case No. 3027, convicting the same appellant of the crime of incestuous rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1, in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (
RPC
).
The facts follow.
AAA,
[1]
 the victim, was born on November 11, 1991 to spouses BBB and CCC. When AAA was 7 years old, her father died and, thereafter, her mother re-married. Her new husband, appellant was then a carpenter and charcoal maker upon whom she had two children. Sometime in the morning of September 27, 2006, the victim's mother CCC told the former to accompany, her stepfather, appellant, to the farm at Lagao, Lambayong, Sultan Kudarat to help the latter in making charcoal. Around 10 o'clock in the morning of the same day, appellant and AAA arrived at the farm and, thereafter, appellant told AAA to cook food while appellant was making charcoal. Afterwards, appellant suddenly held the hands of AAA, then covered her mouth, and dragged her. Appellant warned AAA not to shout otherwise he would hack her. AAA tried to resist but was overpowered by appellant's strength. Appellant then laid her on the ground, undressed her, removed her pants and underwear, showed his penis, and masturbated. Thereafter, appellant mounted on top of AAA, spread her legs, inserted his penis into her vagina, and made several coitus movements, all the while oblivious of AAA's pleas.
On November 6, 2007, around 8 o'clock in the evening, appellant raped AAA again at their 
kubo
 in the farm. While AAA was sleeping, she felt appellant, who was armed with a bolo, touch her face, her breast and then her vagina. Appellant proceeded to undress her, kissed her private parts, and then threatened to kill her if she shouted. Appellant then mounted on top of AAA and inserted his penis into her vagina. Thereafter, appellant further threatened AAA that he will kill her, her mother and her siblings if she told anyone what happened.
Cordero, a neighbor of AAA, on November 29, 2007, heard the latter crying, thus, she immediately went to AAA's house to peep inside and saw appellant beating AAA. When Cordero went near the door, appellant stopped beating AAA and immediately went out of the house and walked away. It was then that AAA confided to Cordero that appellant was forcing her to go with him to the farm where appellant intends to rape her again. Cordero relayed the matter to AAA's mother. Cordero, thereafter, accompanied AAA to the police station. The medical examination conducted on AAA showed that she has "old, healed lacerations of vagina at 1 o'clock, 3 o'clock; 5 o'clock; 7 o'clock and 11 o'clock."
Hence, an Information was filed against appellant which reads as follows:
That on or about 8:00 o'clock in the evening of November 6, 2007 inside the "kubo" located at Barangay Lagao, Municipality of Lambayong, Province of Sultan Kudarat, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, armed with a bolo, with force, threat and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeed in having carnal knowledge with his stepdaughter AAA, a fifteen (15) year old girl having been born on November 11, 1991 and daughter of CCC, wife of the accused, against her will and consent, which act of the accused debases, degrades the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child as a human being.
CONTRARY TO LAW, particularly Article 266-A paragraph 1 in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines and Republic Act No. 7610.
Appellant pleaded not guilty.
Appellant denied the charge against him and insisted that during the time of the alleged incidents, he was in Barangay Lagao, Lambayong, Sultan Kudarat making charcoal; and that he was alone at that time.
The RTC, Branch 20, Tacurong City found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of incestuous rape and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
. The dispositive portion of the Judgment
[2]
 dated September 2, 2009 reads follows:
Wherefore, upon all the foregoing considerations, the court FINDS the guilt of accused HENRY BENTAYO y VISTA to the crime of Incestuous Rape beyond reasonable doubt and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay the private complainant the following:
a. The amount of P75,000.00 as Civil Indemnity;
b. The amount of P50,000.00 as and by way of Moral Damages;
c. The amount of P25,000.00 as and by way of Exemplary Damages
Including their interests at twelve (12%) percent per annum computed from April 8, 2008 when the above-entitled case was filed in court and until their full payment.
For being a detention prisoner, the entire period of his preventive imprisonment shall be credited in the service of sentence imposed on him, provided that he shall abide in writing with the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners, otherwise, with only four-fifths (4/5) thereof.
Pursuant to Supreme Court Circular No. 4-92-A, the accused shall immediately be transferred to the National Bilibid Prisons in [Muntinlupa] City.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
The CA affirmed
[3]
 the decision of the RTC with modification that appellant must pay AAA the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, and interest on all damages at the rate of six percent (6%) 
per annum
 from the finality of judgment until fully paid, thus:
WHEREFORE, the Judgment dated September 2, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 20, Tacurong City in Criminal Case No. 3027 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Henry Bentayo is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of incestuous rape and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, without the benefit of parole.
Further, accused-appellant is ORDERED to pay AAA the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages and interest on all damages at the rate of six percent (6%) 
per annum
 from the finality of judgment until fully paid.
SO ORDERED.
Hence, the present appeal.
According to appellant, the prosecution was not able to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
The appeal lacks merit.
Under paragraph 1 (a) of Art. 266-A of the RPC, the elements of rape are: (1) that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) that such act was accomplished through force, threat, or intimidation. However, when the offender is the victim's father, as in this case, there need not be actual force, threat or intimidation because when a father commits the odious crime of rape against his own daughter, who was also a minor at the time of the commission of the offenses, his moral ascendancy or influence over the latter substitutes for violence and intimidation.
[4]
 Thus, all the elements are present.
In testifying before the trial court, AAA was able to narrate in detail the crime committed, thus:

A: He masturbated, sir.

COURT (TO WITNESS): You speak louder so that your stepfather could hear.
A: He was pumping or making a push-and-pull movement, sir.
[5]
The clear and straightforward testimony of AAA, as corroborated by the medical findings show beyond reasonable doubt that AAA was raped. When the victim's testimony is corroborated by the physical findings of penetration, there is sufficient foundation to conclude the existence of the essential requisite of carnal knowledge.
[6]
As to appellant's contention that the testimony of AAA is full of inconsistencies and, hence, should not be given credence, this Court has ruled that discrepancies referring only to minor details and collateral matters do not affect the veracity or do not detract from the essential credibility of a witness' declarations, as long as these are coherent and intrinsically believable on the whole.
[7]
 Furthermore, it is an accepted doctrine in rape cases that in the absence of evidence of improper motive on the part of the victim to falsely testify against the accused, her testimony deserves credence.
[8]
Appellant also insists that the inability of AAA to remember the time and date when the crime was committed is detrimental to the case of the prosecution. This Court finds such argument worthless. The date and time of the commission of the crime of rape becomes important only when it creates serious doubt as to the commission of the rape itself or the sufficiency of the evidence for purposes of conviction.
[9]
 In other words, the "date of the commission of the rape becomes relevant only when the accuracy and truthfulness of the complainant's narration practically hinge on the date of the commission of the crime."
[10]
 Moreover, the date of the commission of the rape is not an essential element of the crime.
[11]
Anent appellant's defense of denial and alibi, bare assertions thereof cannot overcome the categorical testimony of the victim. Denial is an intrinsically weak defense which must be buttressed with strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility. On the other hand, for alibi to prosper, it must be demonstrated that it was physically impossible for appellant to be present at the place where the crime was committed at the time of commission.
[12]
As to the penalty imposed, the RTC was correct in imposing the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 in lieu of death because of its suspension under R.A. No. 9346.
[13]
As to the award of damages, a modification must be made per 
People v. Jugueta
.
[14]
 Where the penalty imposable is death but because of its suspension under R.A. No. 9346, the penalty imposed is 
reclusion perpetua
, the amounts of damages shall be as follows:
1) Civil Indemnity - P100,000.00
2) Moral Damages - P100,000.00
3) Exemplary Damages - P100,000.00
WHEREFORE
, the appeal of Henry Bentayo is 
DISMISSED
 for lack of merit and the Decision dated November 14, 2014 of the Court of Appeals affirming the Judgment dated September 2, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 20, Tacurong City in Criminal Case No. 3027, convicting appellant of the crime of incestuous rape defined and penalized under Art. 266-A (1) in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353 and Republic Act No. 7610, and imposing the penalty of 
Reclusion Perpetua
 without eligibility for parole under R.A. No. 9346 is 
AFFIRMED
 with
 MODIFICATION
 as to the award of damages which shall now be, as follows: civil indemnity in the amount of P100,000.00; moral damages in the amount of P100,000.00; and exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00, as ruled by this Court in 
People v. Jugueta
,
[15]
 with the appellant paying an interest of six percent (6%) 
per annum
 on all damages awarded from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.
SO ORDERED.
Carpio, (Chairperson)
, and 
Leonen, JJ.
, concur.

Martires, JJ.

 This is pursuant to the ruling of this Court in 
People of the Philippines v. Cabalquinto
 (533 Phil. 703, 709 [2006]), wherein this Court resolved to withhold the real names of the victims-survivors and to use fictitious initials instead to represent them in its decisions. Likewise, the personal circumstances of the victims-survivors or any other information tending to establish or compromise their identities, as well as those of their immediate family or household members, shall not be disclosed. The names of such victims, and of their immediate family members other than the accused, shall appear as "AAA," "BBB," "CCC," and so on. Addresses shall appear as "XXX" as in "No. XXX Street, XXX District, City of XXX."
The Supreme Court took note of the legal mandate on the utmost confidentiality of proceedings involving violence against women and children set forth in Sec. 29 of Republic Act No. 7610, otherwise known as Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act; Sec. 44 of Republic Act No. 9262, otherwise known as Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004; and Sec. 40 of A.M.
