ASELA BRINAS Y DEL FIERRO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.




CAGUIOA, J:


This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 (Petition), filed pursuant to Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court (Revised Rules), elevating the Decision
[2]
 dated January 27, 2020 (assailed Decision) and Resolution
[3]
 dated October 19, 2020 (assailed Resolution) of the Court of Appeals,
[4]
 in CA-G.R. CR No. 42784. The assailed Decision affirmed, with modification, the Decision
[5]

 dated April 13, 2018 rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Iba, 
Zambales, Branch 71 (RTC), in Criminal Case (CC) No. RTC-5916-1, which 
found petitioner Asela BriÃ±as y Del Fierro (BriÃ±as) guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of grave oral defamation in relation to 
Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. (R.A.) 7610,
[6]
 otherwise known as the "Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act." 
The Facts


BriÃ±as was charged with the crime of Grave Oral Defamation in relation to R.A. 7610 in an Amended Information,
[7]
 the accusatory portion of which reads:


"That on or about the 25
th
 day of January 2010 in
 the afternoon, at the Challenger Montessori School, Inc. in Brgy. Zone 
VI, Municipality of Iba, Province of Zambales, Philippines, and within 
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with 
deliberate intent of bringing 16-year old Micolie
[8]
 Mari Maevis S. Rosauro and 
16-year old Keziah Liezle
[9]
 
D. Polojan
,
 into discredit, disrepute and contempt, did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully, feloniously and publicly utter the following defamatory 
words, to wit: 
"pinakamalalandi, pinakamalilibog, pinakamahader[a] at hindot," "Mga putang ina kayo[."]
 and other words similar thereto, which debased, degraded and demeaned Micolie Mari Maevis S. Rosauro and 
Keziah Liezle D. Dolojan
 of 
their

 intrinsic worth and dignity, and to the grave humiliation, 
embarrassment, damage and prejudice of said minors Micolie Mari Maevis 
S. Rosauro and 
Keziah Liezle D. Dolojan
."
[10]


Upon arraignment, BriÃ±as pleaded "not guilty." Trial on the merits ensued thereafter.
[11]
 


Version of the Prosecution
 

The prosecution presented as witnesses, 1) Micolle Mari Maevis Rosauro 
(Micolle) and 2) Keziah Liezle Dolojan (Keziah) (collectively, private 
complainants); 3) Elizabeth Dolojan (Elizabeth), Keziah's mother; 4) 
Christian Rosauro (Christian), Micolle's father; 5) Senior Police 
Officer (SPO) 2 Evangeline Trapsi; and 6) Martha Johanna Dela Cruz (Dela
 Cruz), a psychologist,
[12]
 
whose testimonies can be summarized as follows:

In 2010, the private complainants, both 16 years old, were fourth year 
high school students at Challenger Montessori School (Challenger), 
Sagapan, Iba, Zambales. BriÃ±as was the directress and owner of 
Challenger.
[13]
 

In the morning of January 25, 2010, the private complainants and their 
classmates sent a text message to a certain Charlene, one of their 
classmates. The message said: 
"Hi cha
[14]
 
ate Gale to kumusta na[?]"

 Apparently, the person named Gale mentioned in said message was BriÃ±as'
 daughter. After their recess period, Charlene's mother arrived and got 
angry at the private complainants and their classmates who sent the 
message for allegedly quarrelling with her daughter.
[15]
 

At around 2:30 in the afternoon, BriÃ±as called the private complainants 
and their six other classmates to the faculty room. There, in front of 
the teachers and other students, BriÃ±as shouted at them and inquired as 
to who sent the text message which used her daughter's name. The private
 complainants and their classmates admitted that they all planned to 
send the text message to Charlene and that the sim card which was used 
to send the same was owned by Micolle.
[16]
 
BriÃ±as then threatened to sue Micolle and said, 
"Idedemanda kita with
 my iron hand with this evidence. I will serve it to you in a silver 
platter, your (sic) defiant kung tutuusin kamaganak (sic) pa kita dahil 
sa background mo pero hindi because you are disobedience (sic), nung 
pumasok ka dito para kang birhen pero ngayon anong nangyari sa iyo may 
demonyo na sa likod mo"
 and 
"I will sue you in court[. S]iguro 
[naiinggit] kayo sa anak ko kasi maganda, matalino at mayaman ang anak 
ko, sabihin niyo sa parents ninyo gawing umaga ang gabi para yumaman 
tulad ko, naturingan pa naman kayong pinakamagaganda, pinakamatatalino, 
pinakamababait, pinakamalalandi, pinakamalilibog, pinakamahadera at 
hindot"
[17]
 BriÃ±as likewise raised her middle finger in front of the private complainants, and said 
"ito kayo"
[18]
 and 
"mga
 putang ina kayo. Sa ganyang ugali ninyo sinisigurado ko hindi ninyo 
mare reach (sic) ang dreams ninyo at ngayon pa lang sinasabi ko na I 
hate your
."
[19]


Later that day, Keziah narrated the incident to her mother and said that
 she was ashamed of going back to school and afraid that she might not 
graduate. Micolle, on the other hand, also informed her father of the 
incident, saying that she felt scared and disappointed as BriÃ±as was 
rebuking them.
[20]
 Sometime in February 2010, the private complainants reported the incident to the police authorities.
[21]


The private complainants were suspended for five days and thereafter, or
 just two days before their graduation, they were expelled. The private 
complainants' school records were also withheld. Because of this, they 
were delayed in enrolling for college and were then forced to seek the 
help of the Department of Education (DepEd) who, in turn, informed 
Challenger of the illegality of the means taken by it.
[22]

 It was only then that Challenger released the necessary documents for 
the private complainants to enroll for college and the word "expelled" 
was removed from their report cards.
[23]
 

Christian testified that because of the incident, his daughter Micolle 
suffered sleepless nights, fear, and never regained her confidence. When
 she was brought to the Department of Social Welfare and Development, 
her hands were shaking out of fear.
[24]
 Keziah, on the other hand, sought the help of a psychologist from the University of Santo Tomas (UST) for two months.
[25]

 Dela Cruz, the psychologist who attended to Keziah, found her to be 
exhibiting depression, anxiety attack and inability to sleep â symptoms 
of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
[26]


Version of the Defense
 
The defense presented BriÃ±as as lone witness.
[27]

 She narrated the following:


In 2010, BriÃ±as was the directress of Challenger. On January 25, 2010, 
she called the private complainants and their classmates to the faculty 
room. She tried to remind them of their behavior in the school 
considering that their graduation was fast approaching and she did not 
want them to have problems therewith. Out of anger and a desire to 
straighten their behavior for the children's welfare, she scolded them 
and used the words 
"punyeta"
 and 
"malandi."
 The students remained silent the entire time and immediately went to their classroom thereafter 
[28]

 She denied that the private complainants were expelled. In fact, they 
were included in the graduation ceremony but they wrote personal letters
 informing BriÃ±as that they were not interested in attending the 
graduation rites.
[29]
 


The Ruling of the
 RTC


In its Decision
[30]
 dated 
April 13, 2018, the RTC gave credence to the prosecution's testimonies, 
found BriÃ±as guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged but 
appreciated in her favor the mitigating circumstance of passion and 
obfuscation. It disposed of the case thus:


WHEREFORE
, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused 
ASELA BRIÃAS y DEL FIERRO

 guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of grave oral defamation in
 relation to Section 10 (a) of R.A. No. 7610 and she is sentenced to 
suffer the indeterminate penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of
 
prision correccional
 in its medium period, as minimum to six (6) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period, as maximum.
 
SO ORDERED.
[31]


BriÃ±as appealed to the CA. Thereafter, the People, through the Office of
 the Solicitor General (OSG), and the private complainants filed their 
respective appeal briefs.
[32]


The Ruling of the CA


In the assailed Decision, the CA affirmed, with modification, the RTC's Decision as follows:


WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
DENIED
. The assailed Decision is 
AFFIRMED
 with the 
MODIFICATION

 that the accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate 
penalty of four (4) years, two (2) months, and one (1) day of 
prision correccional
 in its maximum period, as minimum, to six (6) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor

 in its minimum period, as maximum. She is also ordered to pay each of 
the private complainants [P]20,000.00 as moral damages and to pay 
private complainant Keziah Liezl Dolojan [P]5,000.00 as temperate 
damages, plus interest at the rate of 6% reckoned from the finality of 
the decision until full payment.


IT IS SO ORDERED.
[33]


The CA concluded that the prosecution was able to establish that BriÃ±as 
had publicly defamed the private complainants, with intention to debase,
 degrade, and demean their intrinsic worth as human beings. It gave no 
credence to the claim of BriÃ±as that she merely acted in the heat of 
anger and intended to discipline the students.
[34]


Thus, the present Petition.


Issue


The main issue for resolution of the Court is whether the RTC and the CA
 erred in convicting BriÃ±as of the crime of grave oral defamation in 
relation to Section 10(a) of R.A. 7610.


The Court's Ruling


The Petition is meritorious.


In gist, BriÃ±as posits that she was improperly convicted of a crime 
which does not exist because grave oral defamation under the Revised 
Penal Code (RPC) and violation of Section 10(a) of R.A. 7610 are 
different and mutually exclusive offenses. Hence, convicting her for one
 in relation to the other was an error. She claims that she cannot be 
made liable for child abuse under Section 10(a) of R.A. 7610 because the
 same requires a specific criminal intent to degrade, debase or demean 
the intrinsic worth of a child as a human being which is lacking in the 
present case.



There is no crime of grave oral

defamation in relation to Section 10(a)

of R.A. 7610.



Section 10(a), R.A. 7610 provides:


SEC 10. 
Other Acts of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's Development
.

(a) Any person who shall commit any other acts of child abuse, cruelty 
or exploitation or to be responsible for other conditions prejudicial to
 the child's development including those covered by Article 59 of 
[Presidential Decree] No. 603, as amended, but not covered by the 
Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall suffer the penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period.


In turn, Section 3(b) of R.A. 7610 defines child abuse and enumerates the acts covered by it, thus:


SEC 3. 
Definition of terms. 
â


x x x x


(b) "Child Abuse" refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child which includes any of the following:


(1) Psychological and physical abuse, neglect, cruelty, sexual abuse and emotional maltreatment;


(2) Any act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being;



(3) Unreasonable deprivation of his basic needs for survival, such as 
food and shelter; or


(4) Failure to immediately give medical treatment to an injured child 
resulting in serious impairment of his growth and development or in his 
permanent incapacity or death. (Emphasis supplied)


Section 10(a) is clear in that it punishes acts of child abuse which are
 "not covered by the Revised Penal Code." Hence, on this point, BriÃ±as 
is correct â she cannot be convicted of grave oral defamation under the 
RPC 
in relation
 to Section 10(a) of R.A. 7610. From the plain 
language of Section 10(a), the acts punished under it and those punished
 under the RPC are mutually exclusive. Acts which are already covered by
 the RPC are excluded from the coverage of Section 10(a). 
R.A. 7610 is a special law designed to provide special protection to 
children from all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, 
discrimination, and other conditions prejudicial to their development. 
Children, such as the private complainants, are under the protective 
mantle of R.A. 7610 which supplies the inadequacies of existing laws 
treating of crimes committed against children such as the RPC, by 
providing for stronger deterrence against child abuse and exploitation 
through, among others, stiffer penalties for their commission, thus:


Republic Act No. 7610 is a measure geared towards the 
implementation of a national comprehensive program for the survival of 
the most vulnerable members of the population, the Filipino children, in
 keeping with, the Constitutional mandate under Article XV, Section 3, 
paragraph 2, that "The State shall defend the right of the children to 
assistance, including proper care and nutrition, and special protection 
from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, and other 
conditions prejudicial to their development." This piece of legislation 
supplies the inadequacies of existing laws treating crimes committed 
against children, namely, the Revised Penal Code and Presidential Decree
 No. 603 or the Child and Youth Welfare Code. As a statute that provides
 for a mechanism for strong deterrence against the commission of child 
abuse and exploitation, the law has stiffer penalties for their 
commission, and a means by which child traffickers could easily be 
prosecuted and penalized. Also, the definition of child abuse is 
expanded to encompass not only those specific acts of child abuse under 
existing laws but includes also "other acts of neglect, abuse, cruelty 
or exploitation and other conditions prejudicial to the child's 
development."
[35]


Considering the allegations in the Information and the evidence 
presented, the question now is: did the prosecution prove beyond 
reasonable doubt the guilt of BriÃ±as for child abuse under Section 10(a)
 of R.A. 7610?


A conviction for child abuse under 
Section 10(a) in relation to Section 
3(b)(2) of R.A. 7610 requires 
the presence
of intent to debase, 
degrade or demean
the intrinsic 
worth of the child as a
human being.
 

A study of relevant jurisprudence reveals that a 
specific intent

 to debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth of a child as a human 
being is required for conviction under Section 10(a) of R.A. 7610 in 
relation to Section 3(b)(2).
[36]

 This is especially true if the acts allegedly constituting child abuse 
were done in the spur of the moment, out of emotional outrage.
[37]
 
"Debasement" is defined as the act of reducing the value, quality, or 
purity of something; "degradation," on the other hand, is a lessening of
 a person's or thing's character or quality while "demean" means to 
lower in status, condition, reputation, or character.
[38]
 

Hence, the prosecution must not only prove that the acts of child abuse 
under Section 3(b)(2) were committed, but also that the same were 
intended to debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of
 the minor victim as a human being. 
This requirement of specific intent was first established in the case of
 
Bongalon v. People
[39]
 
(Bongalon)
.
 Therein, the accused was charged under Section 10(a) because he struck 
and slapped the face of a minor, after finding out that the latter threw
 stones at the accused's own minor daughters and burnt the hair of one 
of them. The Court therein ruled that the laying of hands against a 
child, when done at the spur of the moment and in anger, cannot be 
deemed as an act of child abuse under Section 10(a), as the essential 
element of intent to debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth and 
dignity of the child as a human being is not present:


Although we affirm the factual findings of fact by the RTC 
and the CA to the effect that the petitioner struck Jayson at the back 
with his hand and slapped Jayson on the face, we disagree with their 
holding that his acts constituted child abuse within the purview of the 
above-quoted provisions. The records did not establish beyond reasonable
 doubt that his laying of hands on Jayson had been intended to debase 
the "intrinsic worth and dignity" of Jayson as a human being, or that he
 had thereby intended to humiliate or embarrass Jayson. 
The records 
showed the laying of hands on Jayson to have been done at the spur of 
the moment and in anger, indicative of his being then overwhelmed by his
 fatherly concern for the personal safety of his own minor daughters who
 had just suffered harm at the hands of Jayson and Roldan. 
With the 
loss of his self- control, he lacked that specific intent to debase, 
degrade or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human 
being that was so essential in the crime of 
child abuse
.
[40]


Child abuse cases following 
Bongalon
 likewise adopted the specific intent requirement. 

In 
Jabalde v. People
[41]
 
(Jabalde)
,
 the accused, after the Court determined her to have lacked the specific
 intent to debase the minor victim, was convicted only of slight 
physical injuries under the RPC instead of child abuse under R.A. 7610 
for which she was charged. Therein, the accused, after being informed 
that her daughter's head was punctured, thought the latter was already 
dead. The accused fainted and when she regained consciousness, she 
slapped and choked the minor victim who she believed had harmed her 
daughter. The Court held that the spontaneity of the accused's acts and 
the fact that the victim suffered only minor abrasions show that the 
laying of hands was an offshoot of the accused's emotional outrage and a
 desire to rescue her own child from harm; hence, there was no specific 
intent to debase the intrinsic worth of the child. 
This specific intent was likewise found missing in 
Calaoagan v. People
[42]
 
(Calaoagan)

 wherein the accused inflicted injuries in the heat of an argument, 
during an altercation between the accused's group and that of the minor 
as they met on the street without any prior confrontation.


Even in cases where the Court did convict the accused of violation of 
Section 10(a), the Court highlighted the need for the prosecution to 
prove specific intent to debase in child abuse. In 
Torres v. People
,
[43]

 the Court affirmed the presence of this intent when accused, with 
excessive force, whipped the child's neck with a wet t-shirt, not just 
once but three times, causing the child to fall down the stairs and 
sustain a contusion. The Court said that if the only intention of the 
accused was to discipline the child and stop him from interfering in the
 conciliation proceedings, he could have resorted to other less violent 
means.


While the mentioned cases requiring specific intent to debase, degrade 
or demean the intrinsic worth of the child as a human being pertain to 
child abuse by physical deeds, 
i.e
., the laying of hands against 
the child, the same treatment has been extended to the utterance of 
harsh words against minors. In 
Talocod v. People
[44]
 
(Talocod)
,
 the accused, right after being informed by her own child that the minor
 victim had berated the former, immediately confronted the victim and 
furiously shouted: 
"[h]uwag mong pansinin yan. At putang ina yan. Mga walang kwenta yan, [m]ana-mana lang yan!"
[45]

 The Court acquitted the accused of the charge of child abuse for 
failure of the prosecution to prove that the utterances were 
specifically intended to debase the child, they being only offhand 
remarks brought about by the spur of the moment and out of parental 
concern for her child, thus;


Notably, case law qualifies that for one to be held 
criminally liable for the commission of acts of Child Abuse under 
Section 10 (a), Article VI of RA 7610, "the prosecution [must] prove a 
specific
 intent to debase, degrade, or demean the intrinsic worth of the child; 
otherwise, the accused cannot be convicted [for the said offense]
."


x x x x


While the aforementioned cases pertain to the commission of child abuse by physical deeds, 
i.e.
,
 the laying of hands against a child, the same treatment has also been 
extended to the utterance of harsh words, invectives, or expletives 
against minors.
 In 
Escolano v. People
, which involved facts similar to the instant case, the Court held that the 
mere shouting of invectives at a child, 
when carelessly done out of anger, frustration, or annoyance
, does not constitute Child Abuse under Section 10 (a) of RA 7610 absent evidence that the utterance of such words were 
specifically intended to debase, degrade, or demean
 the victim's intrinsic worth and dignity,

 to wit:


x x x x


Verily, based on the foregoing narration, there appears no indication 
that petitioner deliberately intended to shame or humiliate AAA's 
dignity in front of his playmates. On the contrary, it is rather 
apparent that petitioner merely voiced the alleged utterances as offhand
 remarks out of parental concern for her child. Hence, in view of the 
absence of a specific intent to debase, degrade, or demean the victim's 
intrinsic worth and dignity in this case, the Court finds that 
petitioner cannot be held criminally liable for committing acts of Child
 Abuse under Section 10 (a), Article VI of [R.A.] 7610.
[46]


Escolano v. People
[47]
 
(Escolano) likewise involved the hurling of expletive remarks at a 
child. Here, the Court acquitted the accused for child abuse, noting 
that she lacked the intent to debase the child, her acts having been 
done only in the heat of anger and in order to stop the unruly behavior 
of the children who were throwing ketchup sachets at her.


As demonstrated by the cases above, the presence or absence of specific 
intent to debase the child in child abuse cases may be drawn from the 
circumstances of the case and the manner by which the accused inflicted 
the physical or psychological injuries upon the minor. For instance, 
lack of intent to debase may be proven by demonstrating that the 
allegedly abusive acts were solely out of emotional outrage in the spur 
of the moment, as the Court held in 
Bongalon, Jabalde, Calaoagan, and Talocod
.


Another defense that may refute the attendance of intent to debase the 
child is that the accused, in committing the acts complained of, merely 
intended to discipline or correct a wrongful behavior of the minor. This
 holds especially true in cases wherein the accused is legally entrusted
 with the care and discipline of the minor victim such as the latter's 
teacher.
[48]


In 
Rosaldes v. People
,
[49]

 similar to the present case, the accused was the school teacher of the 
child victim, a Grade 1 student. The accused was drowsing off on a sofa 
as the child entered and accidentally bumped her. The accused then 
pinched the child on the thigh, held him in the armpits and threw him on
 the floor causing the child to hit a desk and lose consciousness. 
Instead of feeling any remorse, the accused then held the child by his 
ears and pushed him again to the floor. The child sustained severe 
injuries. The accused interposed the defense that she had no intention 
to debase the victim, her acts of maltreatment being merely aimed at 
disciplining the child which she, as a schoolteacher, could reasonably 
do under the doctrine of 
in loco parentis
. The Court, while 
recognizing the right of a teacher to discipline his or her pupils, 
nevertheless convicted the accused of child abuse, ruling that her acts 
were unnecessary and excessive which caused the child severe injuries. 
This effectively refuted the accused's claim that she merely intended to
 discipline the child. Moreover, the Court noted that such infliction of
 physical harm constitutes corporal punishment which is expressly 
prohibited by the Family Code, thus:


Although the petitioner, as a schoolteacher, could duly 
discipline Michael Ryan as her pupil, her infliction of the physical 
injuries on him was unnecessary, violent and excessive. The boy even 
fainted from the violence suffered at her hands. She could not 
justifiably claim that she acted only for the sake of disciplining him. 
Her physical maltreatment of him was precisely prohibited by no less 
than the Family Code, which has expressly banned the infliction of 
corporal punishment
 by a school administrator, teacher or individual engaged in child care exercising special parental authority 
(i.e., in loco parentis), viz
.:


Article 233. The person exercising substitute parental authority shall 
have the same authority over the person of the child as the parents.


In no case shall the school administrator, teacher or individual engaged
 in child care exercising special parental authority inflict corporal 
punishment upon the child. (n)


x x x x


In the crime charged against the petitioner, therefore, the maltreatment
 may consist of an act 
by deeds
 or 
by words
 that 
debases, degrades or demeans

 the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being. The act 
need not be habitual. The CA concluded that the petitioner "went 
overboard in disciplining Michael["] x x x.
[50]


In convicting the accused, the Court likewise considered the fact that 
the accused's maltreatment of the victim was not an isolated case. One 
of the prosecution witnesses who was also a pupil of the accused 
revealed on cross-examination that she had likewise experienced the 
accused's cruelty. Moreover, it was shown that the accused was already 
previously convicted by the RTC for maltreatment of another child in 
another case. The Court held that such previous incidents manifested 
that the accused had "a propensity for violence." Finally, the Court 
considered the emotional trauma of the child, who was compelled to 
transfer school out of fear of the accused.


In 
Lucido v. People
,
[51]

 the accused, who was a neighbor of the minor's family, was entrusted 
with the custody of the minor upon the accused's request as the latter 
was living alone. While with the accused, the minor suffered physical 
abuse through repeated strangulation, beating, and pinching by the 
former, causing the child to limp. The accused interposed the defense 
that her actuations were merely intended to discipline the minor. The 
Court rejected the defense, noting that the abusive acts of the accused 
were extreme measures of punishment not commensurate with the discipline
 of an eight-year-old child.


Hence, based on the foregoing case law, a prosecution for child abuse 
under Section 10(a) in relation to Section 3(b)(2) requires the presence
 of a specific intent to debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth 
and dignity of a child as a human being. Such specific intent may be 
refuted by proof that the acts were merely offshoots of emotional 
outrage in the spur of the moment and/or that the accused merely 
intended to discipline the child. In the case where the defense of 
disciplining a child is advanced, the Court may likewise consider if the
 disciplining acts are commensurate to, and may reasonably address, the 
misbehavior of the child being dealt with. If the alleged disciplinary 
measures are excessive and run counter to the purpose of disciplining a 
child, then the defense will be rejected and the accused may be held 
liable for child abuse.


BriÃ±as cannot be held liable for child

abuse under Section 10(a) in relation to

Section 3(b)(2) because the prosecution

failed to prove the presence of intent to

debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic

worth of the private complainants as

human beings.


Applying the foregoing case law to the present case, the Court holds 
that the CA and the RTC erred in finding BriÃ±as guilty of violation of 
Section 10(a) in relation to Section 3(b)(2) of R.A. 7610.


In gist, BriÃ±as argues that her defamatory remarks against the private 
complainants were uttered in a fit of anger as a response to the 
involvement by the private complainants of her child's name in a text 
message which "appears to be a scheme on other students." BriÃ±as claims 
she was "deprived of x x x clear thinking [and] had intended no more 
than telling 
(sic)
 off [the] private complainants, as students 
under her supervision." As such, she did not have the required intent to
 debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth of the minors as human 
beings. On this basis, she argues that she should only be convicted for 
oral defamation under the RPC, if at all.
[52]


Preliminarily, it is worth mentioning that only errors of law and not of facts are reviewable in a petition for review on 
certiorari

 under Rule 45. The rule applies with greater force when the factual 
findings of the CA are in full agreement with that of the RTC. However, 
the rule is not ironclad. A departure therefrom may be warranted when it
 is established that cogent facts and circumstances have been ignored, 
overlooked, misconstrued or misinterpreted, which, if considered, will 
change the outcome of the case.
[53]


Here, the Court, upon an assiduous and careful review of the records, 
finds that the lower courts misinterpreted vital facts that demonstrate 
merit in BriÃ±asâ contentions. In simple terms, there was a failure to 
establish the specific intent to debase, degrade or demean required in 
child abuse cases punished under Section 10(a) in relation to Section 
3(b)(2) of R.A. 7610.


Indeed, the evidence presented shows that BriÃ±as' acts were only done in
 the heat of anger, made after she had just learned that the private 
complainants had deceivingly used her daughter's name to send a text 
message to another student, in what BriÃ±as thought was part of a bigger 
and harmful scheme against the student body. She had also then just 
learned that the mother of the student who received the misleading text 
message had confronted the private complainants for quarreling with the 
former's daughter. It appears, thus, that BriÃ±as' acts were fueled by 
her anger and frustration at the private complainants' mischief which 
caused distress not only to her and her daughter but also to another 
student and parent.


The present case is similar to the above-discussed case of 
Talocod
 wherein the accused shouted expletives at the minors as a response to the latter's beratement of her own child. The cases of 
Bongalon
 and 
Jabalde

 likewise come to mind, wherein the accused parents physically laid 
hands on the minors, in the midst of passionate anger and under the 
impression that their own children were harmed by the minor 
complainants. In all these cases showing that the physical or verbal 
mistreatments were committed in the heat of anger out of parental 
concern for their own children, the accused were acquitted of the charge
 of child abuse under Section 10(a) for absence of intent to debase, 
degrade or demean the minors.


Notably, in the present case, the prosecution failed to prove other 
circumstances which may indicate said intent to debase, degrade or 
demean. The alleged subsequent acts of expulsion, suspension and 
withholding of the school records of the private complainants by BriÃ±as 
were not proven sufficiently. No documentary evidence was presented, 
such as the written notice of suspension or expulsion or the letter of 
DepEd admonishing Challenger's actions. On the other hand, BriÃ±as 
vehemently denies that the private complainants were expelled, suspended
 and that their school documents were withheld.


Indeed, even assuming that the private complainants were suspended and 
expelled and that their school records were unjustly withheld, no proof 
was presented that such acts were committed by BriÃ±as herself or that 
she participated in their commission. The testimonies of the prosecution
 witnesses on this matter are conflicting and confusing. Elizabeth, 
mother of Keziah, testified that her daughter was expelled by Napoleon 
BriÃ±as, Challenger's president and husband of BriÃ±as.
[54]

 Christian, father of Micolle, did not specify who committed these acts.
 He merely asked Micolle's adviser if the latter was suspended and the 
adviser answered, "yes."
[55]
 
It must be stressed that the acts of BriÃ±as' husband or even those of 
Challenger's, in which she serves as a school directress, cannot be 
imputed to BriÃ±as without evidence of her participation in said acts, or
 conspiracy with the perpetrators.


Hence, the only acts proven to have been committed by BriÃ±as are the 
hurling of invectives, made in a spur of the moment and in the heat of 
anger, against the private complainants, after she learned of the 
latter's mischief against her own daughter. Unfortunately for the 
prosecution, these acts, 
by themselves
, do not show intent to 
debase, degrade or demean the minors which is an indispensable element 
of the crime charged. In a criminal case, the prosecution is burdened to
 establish beyond reasonable doubt all of the elements of the crime 
charged, consistent with the basic principle that an accused is presumed
 innocent until proven guilty.
[56]


Thus, due to the prosecution's failure to prove the presence of specific
 intent to debase, degrade, or demean the victims' intrinsic worth and 
dignity, BriÃ±as cannot be held guilty of child abuse under R.A. 7610. 
This is in line with the 2020 case of 
Talocod
 discussed above 
which involved similar acts of slandering minors in the heat of anger 
and without intention to debase, wherein the Court likewise acquitted 
the accused of the crime charged.
