DELOS SANTOS, J.:


Before the Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated August 30, 2017 and the Resolution
[3]
 dated December 13, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CAÂ­G.R. CR No. 39019, which affirmed the Decision
[4]

 dated November 12, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Imus, 
Cavite, Branch 21 in Criminal Case No. 8293-11, finding Journey Kenneth 
Asa y Ambulo (petitioner) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
 Robbery with Intimidation of Persons. 

Antecedents


In an 
Information
 dated January 25, 2010 filed before the RTC,
 petitioner was charged with the crime of Robbery under Article 293 of 
the Revised Penal Code (RPC), the accusatory portion of which reads:


That on or about the 30
th
 day of December 
2010, in the City of DasmariÃ±as, Philippines, the above-named accused, 
with intent [to] gain and by the use of intimidation, to wit: that said 
accused will expose publicly the memory card containing the intimate 
relationship between the complainant Erica Dela Cruz Varias and her 
fiance, thereby causing fear upon said the complainant of being exposed 
to public ridicule and humiliation, by did then and there unlawfully and
 feloniously take, steal and carry away cash money in the amount of 
Php5,000.00 belonging to and owned by said Joyce Erica DelaCruz Varias, 
without her consent, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended 
party in the amount aforementioned. 


CONTRARY TO LAW.
[5]


Upon arraignment, petitioner entered a plea of "not guilty." Trial ensued thereafter.


 The prosecution offered in evidence the oral testimonies of four (4) witnesses, namely: Joyce Erica Varias
[6]

 (private complainant), Police Officer III (PO3) Ronald Lorenzo (PO3 
Lorenzo), PO3 Aaron Abesamis (PO3 Abesamis), and Police Senior Inspector
 (PSI) Karen Palacios, as well as documentary evidence, which included 
the print-out of the private messages among private complainant, 
petitioner, and Alyanna Cassandra (Alyanna).
[7]
 Taken together, the prosecution's evidence established the facts recited below.


On December 23, 2010, petitioner, using the 
Facebook
 account name 
Indho Than
, sent Alyanna a private message by way of 
Facebook

 Messenger, threatening to post provocative photos of her friend, 
private complainant. Alyanna immediately contacted private complainant. 
Using Alyanna's 
Facebook
 account, private complainant sent a 
private message to petitioner, asking him to take down the fake Facebook
 account with her photo as profile. Instead of doing what private 
complainant requested, petitioner threatened private complainant that he
 would make a public post on 
Facebook
 of her private and post-coital photos with her partner.
[8]


 From December 24 to 27, 2010, private complainant and petitioner 
exchanged a series of private messages, where the former begged the 
latter not to release her photos because a lot of people would be 
affected. In desperation, private complainant told petitioner that she 
would do anything to get back her photos. Petitioner then told her that 
he would delete all the photos in his possession and take down her fake 
Facebook account if she would agree to have sex with him. Private 
complainant replied that she would not have sex with petitioner but she 
could give him P5,000.00. Petitioner agreed but told her that he wanted 
to meet her in an apartelle. They agreed to meet at McDonald's Fastfood 
(McDonald's) in Walter Mart, Dasmarifias City on December 30, 2010, 
where private complainant would hand to petitioner P5,000.00 in exchange
 for the memory card containing the private photos and that they would 
then go to Quatro Pasos Apartelle together.
[9]
 


On December 28, 20l0, private complainant told her mother that someone was blackmailing her on 
Facebook
.
 The two went to DasmariÃ±as City Police Station to ask for assistance. 
The police immediately created a team to conduct an entrapment operation
 against petitioner.
[10]


 In the morning of December 30, 2010, as agreed with petitioner, 
private complainant went to McDonald's. Petitioner approached her and 
introduced himself as the one private complainant was exchanging private
 messages with. He brought out his cellular phone and showed private 
complainant the contents of the memory card inserted therein. After 
verifying that the memory card indeed contained her private photos, 
private complainant handed to petitioner an envelope containing the 
marked money amounting to P5,000.00. Petitioner counted the money in 
front of private complainant before removing his phone's memory card and
 giving it to the latter. Private complainant then removed her glasses 
to alert the entrapment team, who then rushed to the scene and 
immediately arrested petitioner. Afterwards, the entrapment team brought
 petitioner to Dasmarifias City Police Station.
[11]


 For his part, petitioner vehemently denied the charge against him. 
He claimed that he went to McDonald's to buy food. He saw private 
complainant thereat whom he recognized as a schoolmate in high school. 
He then approached private complainant and told her, "Your face looks 
familiar."
[12]
 He left her 
alone and sat on a table near hers. While eating, petitioner felt the 
urge to urinate so he went to the toilet and left his bag on the table. 
When he returned, petitioner noticed that his bag was open. He looked 
inside his bag and saw an envelope. He examined the contents of his bag,
 which included two (2) or three (3) memory cards containing his family 
photos. Without any warning, a man handcuffed him and that man 
introduced himself as a police officer. Afraid of the police officer, 
petitioner followed whatever they asked him to do. He was then brought 
to Dasmarifias City Police Station.
[13]


Ruling of the RTC


In a Decision
[14]
 dated 
November 12, 2015, the RTC found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of the crime charged, ruling that all the elements of Robbery by 
means of Intimidation of Persons were present.

Aggrieved, petitioner appealed to the CA. 


Ruling of the CA


In the now assailed Decision
[15]

 dated August 30, 2017, the CA affirmed with the modification the 
Decision of the RTC. The CA agreed with the RTC that petitioner is 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Robbery by means of Intimidation of 
Persons under Article 293 of the RPC. TheCA pointed out that all the 
elements of the crime charged were proven through the intelligible, 
candid, and unwavering testimony of private complainant, which was 
corroborated in all material points by PO3 Lorenzo and PO3 Abesamis 
insofar as the entrapment operation was concerned. The CA also noted 
that private complainant had no motive to testify falsely against 
petitioner. The CA brushed aside the argument of petitioner that there 
was no proof that he and 
Indho Than
, the person private 
complainant was conununicating with on Facebook, were one and the same 
person. The CA held that private complainant clearly and categorically 
stated on the witness stand that petitioner approached her and 
introduced himself as the one she was talking to on 
Facebook
. She
 also positively identified him in her testimony and pointed at him in 
the court room. The CA also noted that petitioner had knowledge of the 
private messages between 
Indho Than
 and private complainant and 
that he was found in possession of the photos of private complainant. 
Further, the CA stressed that the RTC was correct in characterizing the 
crime conunitted as Robbery with Intimidation of Persons, explaining 
that there was sufficient intimidation by petitioner on private 
complainant in as much as his acts engendered the fear in the mind of 
his victim and brought in a sense of mental distress in view of his 
threat to publicly expose her private photos on Facebook. The CA, 
however, deleted the award of exemplary damages since there was no 
aggravating circumstance that attended the robbery.
[16]
 


Dissatisfied with the Decision of the CA, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[17]
 but the same was denied in the now assailed Resolution 
[18]
 dated December 13, 2017. Hence, the instant petition.


The Petition and Arguments of the Parties


Petitioner submits that the prosecution failed to establish his guilt
 beyond reasonable doubt in view of private complainant's contradictory 
statements in her judicial affidavit and in her court testimony as to 
whether petitioner demanded money from private complainant or it was the
 latter who offered money to him. According to petitioner, private 
complainant's contradictory statements make her an incredible witness. 
In addition, petitioner argues that he should not be convicted of 
Robbery with Intimidation of Persons since there was no "unlawful 
taking" to speak of in this case as he did not demand any amount of 
money from private complainant. Rather, it was private complainant who 
offered money to him.
[19]


 Respondent People of the Philippines, through the Office of the 
Solicitor General (OSG), counters that all the elements of the crime of 
Robbery with Intimidation of Persons were established in this case. The 
OSG also opines that the crime charged can be consummated regardless of 
whether petitioner demanded P5,000.00 from private complainant. This 
doest not change the fact that petitioner unlawfully took money from 
private complainant after intimidating her.
[20]


The Issue


The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA 
committed a reversible error in affirming the RTC's Decision convicting 
petitioner of the crime ofRobbery with Intimidation of Persons. 


The Court's Ruling


The petition is not meritorious.

The Court stressed in 
Cu v. Ventura
:
[21]


The Rules of Court requires that only questions of law 
should be raised in petitions filed under Rule 45. This Court is not a 
trier of facts. It will not entertain questions of fact as the factual 
findings of the appellate courts are "final, binding[,] or conclusive on
 the parties and upon this [c]ourt" when supported by substantial 
evidence. Factual findings of the appellate courts will not be reviewed 
nor disturbed on appeal to this court.


x x x x 


 A question of fact requires this court to review the truthfulness or
 falsity of the allegations of the parties. This review includes 
assessment of the "probative value of the evidence presented." There is 
also a question of fact when the issue presented before this court is 
the correctness of the lower courts' appreciation of the evidence 
presented by the parties.
[22]
 (Citations omitted) 


In this case, petitioner contends that he should not be convicted of 
the crime charged because the prosecution's witness, particularly 
private complainant, is not credible for making contradictory or 
inconsistent statements in her judicial affidavit and in her open court 
testimony. Likewise, contrary to the findings of the CA and the RTC, 
petitioner posits that the evidence of the prosecution failed to prove 
that he demanded money from private complainant so as to constitute the 
element of unlawful taking in the crime of Robbery with Intimidation of 
Persons. Obviously, petitioner asks the Court to review and examine the 
probative value of the evidence presented during the trial and the 
factual findings ofthe CA and the RTC in seeking the Court's reversal of
 his judgment of conviction. Clearly, this is not the role of this Court
 because the issue he presented is factual in nature. On this score, the
 petition must fail.


The Court is not oblivious to the prevailing exceptions to the rule 
prohibiting factual review in Rule 45 petitions. As declared in 
Active Wood Products Co., Inc., v. State Investment House, Inc
.,
[23]
 findings of fact by the CA may be passed upon and reviewed by the Court in the following instances, to wit: 


(1) the conclusion is grounded on speculations, surmises or 
conjectures; (2) the inference is manifestly mistaken, absurd or 
impossible; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is 
based on misapprehension of facts; (5) the fmdings of fact are 
conflicting; (6) there is no citation of specific evidence on which the 
factual fmdings are based; (7) the fmdings of absence of facts are 
contradicted by the presence of evidence on record; (8) the findings of 
the CA are contrary to those of the trial court; (9) the CA manifestly 
overlooked certain relevant and undisputed facts that, if properly 
considered, would justify a different conclusion; (10) the fmdings of 
the CA are beyond the issues of the case; and (11) such findings are 
contrary to the admissions of both parties.
[24]


Also, the above-mentioned exceptions similarly apply in petitions for
 review filed before the Court involving civil, labor, tax, or criminal 
cases.
[25]


 In the instant petltlon, however, none of the aforementioned 
exceptions is present which would warrant a review of the factual 
findings ofthe CA.


Contrary to the argument of petitioner, the CA did not commit grave 
abuse of discretion in the appreciation of facts when it found that 
petitioner demanded money from private complainant in exchange for the 
memory card containing the latter's private photos, which made him 
liable for Robbery with Intimidation of Persons. It may be recalled that
 petitioner originally demanded for private complainant to have sex with
 him in exchange for the return of the private photos. Private 
complainant refused and offered P5,000.00 instead. It must be stressed, 
however, that private complainant's counter-offer does not make it "with
 her consent," as the same was made as a result of petitioner's existing
 and continuing threat of posting the private photos on Facebook. It is 
worthy to note that petitioner did not offer to voluntarily and 
unconditionally return the photos of private complainant but instead 
asked for something in exchange for him not to post the same on 
Facebook
.
 In effect, when petitioner accepted private complainant's counter-offer
 of P5,000.00 instead of sex, his demand was merely amended or changed 
from sexual into a monetary one. Accordingly, it is not entirely wrong 
for the RTC and the CA to conclude that, in the end, petitioner demanded
 money in the amount of P5,000.00 from private complainant, which he 
took at McDonald's against private complainant's consent. Concurrently, 
the second element in the crime of Robbery with Intimidation of Persons 
is present in this case -that there is unlawful taking of property 
belonging to another. So is the fourth element of the crime charged 
anent the presence of intimidation of persons, as petitioner's threat to
 post the subject private photos on 
Facebook
 if his demand is not
 met produced fear in the mind of his victim, private complainant, so 
that the latter was forced to give to petitioner the amount of 
P5,000.00, against or without her consent.


Relatedly, and even if the Court is to review the testimony of 
private complainant, she did not make contradictory and inconsistent 
statements on the fact that petitioner demanded from her P5,000.00 in 
exchange of her private photos and so as not to post the same publicly 
on 
Facebook
. As explained, she refused to accede to the original 
demand of petitioner to have sex and offered money instead in the amount
 of P5,000.00. Nonetheless, the acceptance of petitioner of the money 
effectively amended his demand into a monetary one. Thus, it was not 
entirely inconsistent or contradictory at all for private complainant to
 say that she counter-offered to give petitioner P5,000.00 instead of 
having sex with him while also saying that petitioner demanded P5,000.00
 from her. At any rate, even if the Court is to consider the statements 
of private complainant to be inconsistent, the same only refers to a 
minor detail, which will not impinge on the integrity of private 
complainant's testimony in its material whole. As astutely observed by 
the OSG, the issue of whether the amount of P5,000.00 was offered or 
demanded by petitioner is irrelevant in the prosecution against him for 
the crime of Robbery with Intimidation of Persons. It does not change 
the fact that unlawful taking occurred as a result of petitioner's use 
of intimidation on private complainant. As the Court consistently held, 
"[i]nconsistencies on minor details do not impair the credibility of the
 witnesses where there is consistency in relating the principal 
occurrence and positive identification of the assailant."
[26]
 Such inconsistencies reinforce, rather than weaken, credibility.
