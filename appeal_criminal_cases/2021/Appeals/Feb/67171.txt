KOLIN ELECTRONICS CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. KOLIN PHILIPPINES INTERNATIONAL, INC., RESPONDENT.
DECISION




CAGUIOA, J.:[**]


This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]

 (Petition) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, which seeks to reverse 
and set aside the following dispositions of the Court of Appeals (CA) in
 CA-G.R. SP No. 131917:


Decision
[2]
 dated April 
29, 2016 reversing the ruling of the Director General of the 
Intellectual Property Office (IPO-DG) in Appeal No. 14-09-64
[3]

 (IPC No. 14-2007-00167), g1vmg due course to the trademark application 
of Kolin Philippines International, Inc. (KPII), and denying the 
opposition of Kolin Electronics Co., Inc. (KECI); and




Resolution
[4]
 dated November 4, 2016, denying KECI's motion for reconsideration.



Facts


Antecedent cases involving related parties



1. The KECI Ownership Case



On August 17, 1993, Kolin Electronics Industrial Supply (KEIS), owned by
 a certain Miguel Tan, filed with the Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and 
Technology Transfer (BPTTT; now known as the Intellectual Property 
Office or IPO) an application for registration of Trademark Application 
No. 87497 for 
KOLIN
 covering the following products under 
Class 9: automatic voltage regulator, converter, recharger, stereo 
booster, AC-DC regulated power supply, step-down transformer, and PA 
amplifier AC-DC.
[5]



In a Deed of Assignment of Assets dated November 20, 1995, Miguel Tan 
assigned in favor of KECI all the assets. and merchandise stocks of 
KEIS, including its pending application for registration of the 
KOLIN
 mark.
[6]

 The trademark has been continuously used in various products under the 
said classification, and the products are being offered for sale at 
KECI's business establishments.
[7]



On February 29, 1996, Taiwan Kolin Co., Ltd. (TKC) filed with the BPTTT Trademark Application No. 4-1996-106310
[8]
 for 
KOLIN

 initially covering the following goods: "color television, 
refrigerator, window-type air conditioner, split-type air conditioner, 
electric fan, and water dispenser".
[9]



During the pendency of its application, TKC filed a verified Notice of 
Opposition on July 22, 1998 against KECI's trademark application for 
KOLIN
.
 TKC claimed that it is the owner of Taiwan registrations for KOLIN and 
KOLIN SOLID SERIES and that it has a pending application for 
KOLIN
,
[10]
 thus the grant of the 
KOLIN
 application would cause TKC grave and irreparable damage to its business reputation and goodwill because 
KOLIN
 is identical, if not confusingly similar, to TKC's marks. TKC further claimed that if KECI's application for 
KOLIN

 would be granted, this would likely mislead the public as to the 
nature, quality, and characteristics of its goods or products bearing 
the "KOLIN" trademark.
[11]





On December 27, 2002, Director Estrellita Beltran-Abelardo of the 
Intellectual Property Office Bureau of Legal Affairs (IPO-BLA) rendered 
Decision No. 2002-46
[12]
 (
Inter Partes
 Case No. 14-1998-00050) denying TKC's opposition and giving due course to KECI's trademark application for 
KOLIN
.
[13]
 Premised on the factual finding that the subject marks are "the same or almost identical,"
[14]
 the IPO-BLA then opted to focus on the discussion of the prior adopter and user of the mark.
[15]

 The IPO-BLA examined the evidence presented by the parties and 
concluded that KECI "is the prior adopter and user of the mark 'KOLIN' 
in the Philippines, having been able to prove the date of first use of 
its mark in the year 1989, which is ahead of [TKC's] use in the 
Philippines x x x in the year 1996."
[16]
 Thus, TKC's opposition was denied and KECI's trademark application for 
KOLIN
 was given due course.





TKC appealed the decision to the IPO-DG, which, in turn, issued a Decision
[17]
 on November 6, 2003 sustaining the ruling of the IPO-BLA.
[18]
 The IPO eventually issued a Certificate of Registration for 
KOLIN
 in favor of KECI.
[19]

 In the November 29, 2004 issue of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, KECI, 
through counsel, filed a notice informing the public of the issuance of 
the certificate in its favor, and claimed exclusive right of usage over 
the 
KOLIN
 mark.
[20]





On December 10, 2004, TKC filed a petition for review with the CA with a
 prayer for preliminary injunction and/or the issuance of a temporary 
restraining order docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 80641, urging the CA to 
enjoin KECI from asserting exclusive rights to use the 
KOLIN
 mark.
[21]





 
 



On July 31, 2006, the CA issued a Decision
[22]
 against TKC and in favor of KECI. The CA clarified that the Trademark Law
[23]

 was applicable since it was still in effect at the time of the filing 
and during the pendency of the trademark applications of both parties.
[24]
 Accordingly, the CA held that there must be actual use thereof in commerce to acquire ownership of a mark.
[25]
 The CA found as undisputed that KEIS, the predecessor-in-interest of KECI, had been using the 
KOLIN
 mark in the Philippines since February 17, 1989, prior to the filing of the trademark application for 
KOLIN
 in 1993.
[26]
 While TKC claimed prior use of the mark in foreign jurisdictions
[27]
 as early as 1986,
[28]

 the CA agreed with the IPO-BLA and IPO-DG that the concept of "actual 
use" under the Trademark Law refers to use in the Philippines, and not 
abroad.
[29]
 Further, the assignment of rights involving the 
KOLIN
 mark to KECI was not raised as an issue in the case.
[30]

 On the issue of priority being claimed by TKC, the CA agreed with the 
decision of IPO-DG that, whether under the Trademark Law or the 
Intellectual Property Code
[31]
 (IP Code), TKC's "claim of x x x priority right is unavailing."
[32]
 Accordingly, the CA dismissed TKC's petition for lack of merit and affirmed the IPO-DG's decision.
[33]



TKC initially appealed the CA decision by filing with the Court a motion for extension to file a petition for review.
[34]

 However, on September 6, 2007, TKC filed a Manifestation withdrawing 
its motion for extension because "[TKC was] no longer interested in 
pursuing an appeal."
[35]
 
Accordingly, on September 26, 2007, a Resolution was issued by the Court
 considering the case "CLOSED and TERMINATED." In an Entry of Judgment, 
the Resolution was considered final and executory on November 16, 2007
[36]
 (the 
KECI ownership case
).



Thus, by virtue of the 
KECI ownership case
, KECI is the adjudicated owner of the 
KOLIN
 mark under the Trademark Law as against TKC.




 




2. The Taiwan Kolin case



However, in another case that went up to the Court, the registration of 
another KOLIN mark not owned by KECI was allowed. In G.R. No. 209843 
entitled 
Taiwan Kolin Corporation, Ltd. v. Kolin Electronics Co., Inc.
[37]
 (
Taiwan Kolin case
), promulgated on March 25, 2015, the Court gave due course to TKC's Trademark Application for 
KOLIN
.


To recall, before filing an opposition case
[38]
 against KECI's application for 
KOLIN
, TKC had filed on February 29, 1996 Trademark Application No. 4-1996-106310 for 
KOLIN

 initially covering the following goods: "color television, 
refrigerator, window-type air conditioner, split-type air conditioner, 
electric fan, and water dispenser."



On February 10, 1999, Paper No.5 was issued by the trademark 
examiner-Â­in-charge stating that the goods enumerated in TKC's 
application fall under Classes 9, 11, and 21 of the Nice Classification 
(NCL), thus, TKC was required to elect one class of goods for its 
application for
 
KOLIN
.
[39]
 However, the application was considered abandoned as of April 18, 1999 because TKC failed to respond to Paper No. 5.
[40]

 On September 14, 1999, TKC filed a petition to revive the application 
stating, among other things, that in response to Paper No. 5, it was 
electing Class 9 for its application.
[41]
 Further, TKC requested the inclusion of the following goods in its application: "cassette recorder, VCD, whoofer (
sic
),
 amplifiers, camcorders and other audio/video electronic equipment, flat
 iron, vacuum cleaners, cordless handsets, videophones, facsimile 
machines, teleprinters, cellular phones, automatic goods vending 
machines and other electronic equipment belonging to class 9."
[42]



In an Order dated March 14, 2001, the Bureau of Trademarks granted TKC's petition.
[43]

 Consequently, Trademark Application No. 4-1996-106310 was published in 
the IPO Electronic Gazette for Trademarks on May 16, 2006.
[44]
 The "television sets" was, however, not included in the enumeration of goods in the published Trademark Application.
[45]














KECI filed an opposition against TKC's application with the IPOÂ­ BLA on July 13, 2006
[46]
 based on the fact that it is the registered owner of the 
KOLIN
[47]
 mark, which it claimed was confusingly similar to TKC's application for 
KOLIN
. The case was docketed as 
Inter Partes
 Case No. 14-2006-00096.



On November 7, 2006, TKC filed an Answer to the Opposition, claiming, 
among others, that its Trademark Application No. 4-1996-106310 "includes
 television sets and 
that this trademark application later became Trademark Application No. 4-2002-011002

 filed on [December 27, 2002] when it was re-filed/revived after the 
handling lawyer delayed the submission of requirements for the first 
application."
[48]



The IPO-BLA rendered Decision No. 2007-118
[49]
 dated August 16, 2007 sustaining KECI's opposition case and rejecting TKC's application for 
KOLIN
.



On March 27, 2009, TKC filed an Appeal Memorandum with the IPOÂ­ DG, 
claiming that the IPO-BLA erred in denying its application without any 
allowance for use limitation or restriction on televisions and DVD 
players.
[50]


Noting that TKC only wanted its 
KOLIN
 application to be given due course subject to the use limitation or restriction for television and DVD player,
[51]
 the IPO-DG issued a Decision
[52]

 on November 23, 2011 granting TKC's appeal and allowing the 
registration of TKC's mark with a limitation/restriction for the goods 
"television and DVD player".
[53]



Aggrieved, KECI appealed to the CA.



On April 30, 2013, the CA issued a Decision
[54]
 in CA-G.R. SP No. 122565 reversing and setting aside the IPO-DG's decision and reinstating the IPO-BLA decision.
[55]

 It ruled in favor of KECI based on the following grounds: (a) the 
"KOLIN" mark sought to be registered by TKC is confusingly similar to 
KECI's "KOLIN" registration since "[t]he only difference is [KECI's] 
mark is italicized and colored black while that of [TKC] is in pantone 
red color;"
[56]
 (b) there are 
no other designs, special shape or easily identifiable earmarks that 
would differentiate the products of both competing companies;
[57]

 and (c) the intertwined use of television sets with amplifier, booster 
and voltage regulator bolstered the fact that televisions can be 
considered as within the normal expansion of KECI, and is thereby deemed
 covered by its trademark as explicitly protected under Section 138 of 
the IP Code;
[58]
 and (d) the 
denial of TKC's application would prevent the likelihood of confusion 
resulting from the use of an identical mark to closely related goods.
[59]
 TKC moved to reconsider the decision, but this was denied by the CA.



TKC then filed an appeal to the Court.


It is important to highlight that there were 
three (3) marks
 involved in the 
Taiwan Kolin case

 (1) KECI's trademark registration No. 4-1993-087497; (2) TKC's 
trademark application No. 4-1996-106310, which was opposed by KECI; and 
(3) TKC's trademark application No. 4-2002-011002, which was allegedly 
the "revived" version of TKC's application.

To clarify, while Trademark Application No. 4-1996-106310 was indeed revived,
[63]
 it was not through another separate application, contrary to TKC's statement.
[64]



Keeping this in mind, the 
Taiwan Kolin
 case ruled in favor of TKC.


The Court's Third Division stated that identical marks may be registered
 for products from the same classification, citing the discussion in 
Mighty Corporation v. E. & J. Gallo Winery
[65]
 (
Mighty Corporation
).
[66]

 It also held "that emphasis should be on the similarity of the products
 involved and not on the arbitrary classification or general description
 of their properties or characteristics. The mere fact that one person 
has adopted and used a trademark on his goods would not, without more, 
prevent the adoption and use of the same trademark by others on 
unrelated articles of a different kind."
[67]



The Court's Third Division also stated that the CA's approach and 
reasoning "fail[ed] to persuade" and ruled that the products covered by 
TKC's application and KECI's registration are unrelated.
[68]

 In saying that the CA decision was wrong, the Court's Third Division 
only cited and gave credence to the following assertions by TKC to 
establish that the goods are unrelated:


a. TKC's goods are classified as home appliances as opposed 
to KECI's goods, which are power supply and audio equipment accessories;



b. TKC's television sets and DVD players perform functions and purposes 
distinct from KECI's power supply and audio equipment; and



c. TKC sells and distributes its various home appliance products on 
wholesale and to accredited dealers, whereas KECI's goods are sold and 
flow through electrical and hardware stores.
[69]



The Court's Third Division said that the list of products under Class 9 
can be sub-categorized into five different classifications and that the 
products covered by TKC's and KECI's marks fall under different 
sub-categories. It then made a side-by-side comparison of the marks to 
state that the ordinary intelligent buyer is not likely to be confused. 
For reference, the side-by-side comparison used in the case is shown 
below:


(image supposed to be here)

 




Further, it stated that confusion is not likely because the products involved (
i.e.
, "various kinds of electronic products," according to the 
Taiwan Kolin case
) are more expensive than "ordinary consumable household items", so consumers will be more careful in purchasing these products.
[70]
 It also cited the case of 
Emerald Garment Manufacturing Corporation v. Court of Appeals
[71]
 (
Emerald Garment
) which defined an "ordinary intelligent buyer"
as follows:


The definition laid down in 
Dy Buncio v. Tan Tiao Bok

 is better suited to the present case. There, the "ordinary purchaser" 
was defined as one "accustomed to buy, and therefore to some extent 
familiar with, the goods in question. The test of fraudulent simulation 
is to be found in the likelihood of the deception of some persons in 
some measure acquainted with an established design and desirous of 
purchasing the commodity with which that design has been associated. The
 test is not found in the deception, or the possibility of deception, of
 the person who knows nothing about the design which has been 
counterfeited, and who must be indifferent between that and the other. 
The simulation, in order to be objectionable, must be such as appears 
likely to mislead the ordinary intelligent buyer who has a need to 
supply and is familiar with the article that he seeks to purchase".
[72]
 (Italics omitted)




Thus, the Court's Third Division concluded that KECI's trademark 
registration not only covers unrelated goods but is also incapable of 
deceiving the ordinary buyer in relation to TKC's application.
[73]

 Accordingly, TKC's petition was granted, the CA decision was reversed 
and set aside, and the IPOÂ­DG Decision, which gave due course to TKC's 
Trademark Application No. 4-1996-106310 for 
KOLIN
, was reinstated.


Facts of the present case



On September 11, 2006
[74]
 - more than a month after the promulgation of the 
KECI ownership case
 - KPII, an affiliate of TKC,
[75]
 filed Trademark Application No. 4-2006-010021 for the 
kol
i
n
 mark under Class 9 covering "Televisions and DVD players".



On June 12, 2007, KECI filed an opposition against KPII's Trademark 
Application No. 4-2006-010021 based on, among others, the fact that it 
is the registered owner of the 
KOLIN
 mark and that the registration of KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark will cause confusion among consumers.
[76]





In its defense, KPII claimed that its application for 
kol
i
n
 cannot be denied on the basis of the ruling in the 
KECI ownership case
 because it was not a party to said case and the 
KECI ownership case
 is not 
res judicata
 to the instant case.
[77]
 Besides, KPII asserted that the 
KECI ownership case

 specifically clarified that KECI's ownership over the mark is limited 
only in connection with goods specified in KECI's certificate of 
registration and those related thereto.
[78]
 KPII insisted that "Televisions and DVD players" are not related to the goods covered by KECI's registered mark.

IPO-BLA Decision



In a Decision
[82]
 on IPC No. 
14-2007-00167 dated September 9, 2009, the IPO-BLA sustained KECI's 
opposition. One of the reasons why KPII's Trademark Application No. 
4-2006-010021 for 
kol
i
n
 was rejected was the fact that buyers would be confused as to the origin of the products being offered by KECI and KPII.
[83]

 Significantly, the IPO-BLA also noted that KECI had received several 
customer e-mails complaining against or seeking information about the 
products of KPII.
[84]





Further, the IPO-BLA found that KPII is an instrumentality of TKC, as seen in the excerpt below:


An exhaustive scrutiny of the records of the case convince[s] this Bureau to concur with the position of [KECI] that indeed, 
[KPII]
 is an instrumentality of [TKC]. [KECI] presented substantial evidence 
that [KPII] is effectively under the management, supervision and control
 of [TKC] manifested through the assignment of five (5) persons to the 
financial and plant operations x x x; [TKC's] admission of its direct 
participation in the management, supervision and control of [KPII]; 
[TKC's] majority ownership of stocks in [KPII] x x x; and the 
maintenance of one website of both companies and the admission to the 
same x x x.
[85]
 (Emphasis supplied)



Accordingly, the IPO-BLA rejected KPII's application for 
kol
i
n
. The dispositive portion of the IPO-BLA Decision reads:


WHEREFORE, premises considered the Notice of Opposition filed by [KECI], is as it is hereby 
SUSTAINED
.
 Accordingly, Application Serial No. 4-2006-010021 filed by 
respondent-applicant, [KPII] on 27 December 2002 for the mark [kolin] 
under Class 09 for televisions and DVD players, is as it is hereby, 
REJECTED
.



Let the file wrapper of [kolin], subject matter of this case be 
forwarded to the Bureau of Trademarks for appropriate action in 
accordance with this decision.


SO ORDERED.
[86]



Aggrieved, KPII appealed the case to the IPO-DG.


IPO-DG Decision



On September 12, 2013, the IPO-DG issued a Decision
[87]

 on Appeal No. 14-09-64 in IPC No. 14-2007-00167 dismissing KPII's 
appeal. It is important to stress that, at this juncture, the 
Taiwan Kolin case

 had not yet been promulgated. At that time, the case was still pending 
with the Court. The CA decision (CA-G.R. SP No. 122565) that was 
promulgated on April 30, 2013 and where the CA ruled in favor of KECI, 
was the prevailing judgment between KECI and TKC.





The IPO-DG stated that "with the decision of the [CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 
122565] that [TKC's] television sets and DVD players are related to 
[KECI's] goods covered by the latter's certificate of registration for 
KOLIN
, this Office rules in favor of [KECI]."
[88]



Accordingly, the IPO-DG dismissed KPII's appeal. KPII then filed an appeal to the CA, docketed therein as CA-G.R. SP No. 131917.


CA Decision
 (CA-G.R. SP No.131917)



After the promulgation of the 
Taiwan Kolin case
 on March 25, 2015, the CA issued in CA-G.R. SP No. 131917 a Decision
[89]
 dated April 29, 2016 granting KPII's appeal.



Faced with the issue of whether KPII is entitled to the registration of 
the kolin mark covering television and DVD players, the CA relied 
heavily on, and quoted the reasoning in, the 
Taiwan Kolin case
.
[90]
 Accordingly, the CA ruled that KPII may register its mark for television sets and DVD players and the doctrine of 
res judicata
 forbids it from arriving at a contrary conclusion.
[91]
 The dispositive portion of the CA decision reads:


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the petition is hereby 
GRANTED
. The Decision dated September 12, 2013, issued by the [IPOÂ­ DG], in Appeal Case No. 14-09-64 (IPC No. 14-2007-00167), is 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
, and a new one is entered giving due course to [KPII's] Trademark Application No. 04-2006-010021.


Let a copy of this Decision as well as the trademark application and 
records be furnished and returned to the Director of the [IPO-BLA] for 
appropriate action. Further, let the Director of the Bureau of 
Trademarks and the library of the Documentation, Information, and 
Technology Transfer Bureau be furnished a copy of this Decision for 
information, guidance, and records purposes.


SO ORDERED.

Thus, KECI filed the instant Rule 45 Petition, raising the following arguments: (1) the ruling in the 
Taiwan Kolin case
 is not applicable in the present case; and (2) the registration of KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark is contrary to the provisions of the IP Code.






 



In a Comment
[93]
 dated June 5, 2017, KPII argued that the CA had correctly applied the principle of 
res judicata
.



In the Reply
[94]
 dated November 16, 2017, KECI insisted that the ruling in the 
Taiwan Kolin case

 cannot be made to apply in this case. Further, in arguing that the CA 
decision should be reversed, KECI emphasized the confusing similarity 
between the subject marks.


Issue



The main issue in this case is whether KPII should be allowed to register its 
kol
i
n
 mark.


The Court's Ruling



The Petition is granted. KPII is not allowed to register its 
kol
i
n
 mark for "Televisions and DVD players."


I.


RES JUDICATA DOES NOT APPLY



Citing the 
Taiwan Kolin case
, the CA stated that the doctrine of 
res judicata
 is applicable and "forbids [it] from arriving at a contrary conclusion."
[95]
 It stated that all the requisites of 
res judicata
 are fulfilled in the instant case, 
viz
.:


All of these requisites [of 
res judicata
] are fulfilled in the instant case. While KPII may not be involved in the [
Taiwan Kolin case
],
 it must be noted that KPII is an affiliate company of [TKC], as 
admitted by KECI An absolute identity of the parties is not required for
 
res judicata
 to apply, for as long as there exists an identity or community of interest.



It may be claimed that [TKC] is now the owner of the mark KOLIN for 
television and DVD players by virtue of the Supreme Court decision in 
the [
Taiwan Kolin case
], thereby preventing registration in the 
name of KPII. Still, we again emphasize that they are affiliated 
companies and [TKC] has authorized KPII to adopt and use the mark 
"KOLIN" in the Philippines and to register the mark in connection with 
its business dealings. More importantly, however, it appears that the 
marks applied for by [TKC] and KPII are not identical. x x x Thus, since
 there is no identity of marks so as to prevent registration, KPII may 
validly register its mark.
[96]


A. Res judicata in the concept of bar by prior judgment



The Court disagrees with the conclusion of the CA because all the elements of 
res judicata
 are 
not
 present.



The following excerpts in 
Monterona v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.
[97]
 are instructive:


There is "bar by prior judgment" when, as 
between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second 
case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject 
matter, and causes of action. In this instance, the judgment in the 
first case constitutes an absolute bar to the second action. Otherwise 
put, the judgment or decree of the court of competent jurisdiction on 
the merits concludes the litigation between the parties, as well as 
their privies, and constitutes a bar to a new action or suit involving 
the same cause of action before the same or any other tribunal.


x x x x


The elements of 
res judicata
 are: (1) the judgment sought to bar 
the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered 
by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; 
(3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and 
(4) there must be as between the first and second actions, identity of 
parties, subject matter, and causes of action. x x x Should identity of 
parties, subject matter, and causes of action be shown in the two cases,
 then 
res judicata
 in its aspect as a "bar by prior judgment" would apply. x x x
[98]



Based on the facts, the subject matter in this case and the Taiwan Kolin
 case are different. A subject matter is the item with respect to which 
the controversy has arisen, or concerning which the wrong has been done,
 and it is ordinarily the right, the thing, or the contract under 
dispute.
[99]
 In this case, the item to which the controversy has arisen or the thing under dispute is KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark, while in the 
Taiwan Kolin case
, the subject matter is TKC's
 
KOLIN
 mark.





The cause of action in the 
Taiwan Kolin case
 is also different 
from the cause of action in the case at bar. Rule 2, Section 2 of the 
Rules of Court defines a cause of action as an act or omission by which a
 party violates the right of another. In the 
Taiwan Kolin case
, the cause of action was TKC's act of filing Trademark Application No. 4-1996-106310 for 
KOLIN
,
 which allegedly violated KECI's rights because confusion would be 
likely among consumers if TKC's trademark application were to be given 
due course. In contrast, in the case at bar, the cause of action is 
KPII's act of filing Trademark Application No. 4-2006-010021 for 
kol
i
n
.








Thus, there is no bar by prior judgment in this case.


B. Res judicata in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment



Neither can 
res judicata
 in the concept of conclusiveness of 
judgment operate to prevent the Court from determining the 
registrability of KPII's trademark application.



Jurisprudence describes how this principle is applied below:


Section 49(c) of Rule 39 enumerates the concept of 
conclusiveness of judgment. This is the second branch, otherwise known 
as collateral estoppel or estoppel by verdict. This applies where, 
between the first case wherein judgment is rendered and the second case 
wherein such judgment is involved, there is no identity of causes of 
action. As explained by this Court:


It has been held that in order that a judgment in one action
 can be conclusive as to a particular matter in another action between 
the same parties or their privies, it is essential that the issues be 
identical. If a particular point or question is in issue in the second 
action, and the judgment will depend on the determination of that 
particular point or question, a former judgment between the same parties
 will be final and conclusive in the second if that same point or 
question was in issue and adjudicated in the first suit; but the 
adjudication of an issue in the first case is not conclusive of an 
entirely different and distinct issue arising in the second. In order 
that this rule may be applied, it must clearly and positively appear, 
either from the record itself or by the aid of competent extrinsic 
evidence that the precise point or question in issue in the second suit 
was involved and decided in the first. And in determining whether a 
given question was an issue in the prior action, it is proper to look 
behind the judgment to ascertain whether the evidence necessary to 
sustain a judgment in the second action would have authorized a judgment
 for the same party in the first action.
[100]





To emphasize, in the 
Taiwan Kolin case
, the Court only ruled that TKC's Trademark Application No. 4-1996-106310 for 
KOLIN
 should be given due course.



What is involved in this case now before the Court is a new trademark 
application by KPII which means that it is going through an entirely new
 process of determining registrability. There is nothing under the law 
which mandates that registered trademark owners and/or their privies may
 automatically register all similar marks, despite allegations of 
"damage"
[101]
 by opposers.



Since new trademark applications are attempts to claim new exclusive 
rights, there will necessarily be new nuances of "damage", even if the 
same parties are involved, and the Court should carefully consider these
 nuances in deciding to give due course to the application. There are 
new issues on "damage" to KECI here, not decided in the Taiwan Kolin 
case, which affect the registrability of KPII's application for kolin 
and which must be resolved by the Court.



The registration of KPII's kolin will create new rights which would 
change the status quo. Thus, the opposed trademark application before 
the Court presents the following new issues:






a)


 KPII's new application for 
kol
i
n
 essentially amounts to seeking 
exclusivity
[102]
 over a stylized version of the "KOLIN" word as against other parties, including KECI, for a range of goods/services.
[103]
 This issue was not considered in the 
Taiwan Kolin cas
e because the Court only essentially ruled therein that the registration of 
KOLIN
 
will not cause damage to KECL Thus, the relevant questions are these: 
should KPII be given a new right to assert exclusivity over the
 
kol
i
n
 
stylized
 mark, as against KECI, for a range of goods/services? Will KPII's 
exclusive appropriation of a specific stylized version
 
(
kol
i
n
)
 cause "damage" to KECI who, as it stands, has an existing right to use 
any and all stylized versions of "KOLIN" for a range of goods/services (
i.e.
,
 goods covered by its registration, related goods/services, and 
goods/services falling within the normal expansion of its business)?






 


 






b)


 
As mentioned, KECI is the owner of the mark under the Trademark Law based on the 
KECI ownership case
. Section 236
[104]

 of the IP Code mandates that nothing in the IP Code - which logically 
includes marks registered under the IP Code-can adversely affect the 
rights on enforcement of marks acquired in good faith prior to the 
effective date of the law. In this regard, 
does KPII's application under the IP Code for exclusive appropriation of a stylized KOLIN (
kol
i
n
)
 for a range of goods/services adversely affect KECI's rights under 
Section 236 of the IP Code in such a way that it amounts to "damage" to 
KECI? Will KPII's registration adversely affect the rights on KECI's 
enforcement of its KOLIN mark established under the 
KECI ownership case
?






The Court is therefore called upon to resolve the question of whether KPII deserves to 
exclusively appropriate
 a stylized version of the KOLIN word mark for a range of goods/services, considering all aspects of "damage" to KECI.


Because 
this involves a new trademark application
 and 
there are new issues arising here which were not decided in the 
Taiwan Kolin case
, the principle of 
res judicata
 in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment does not apply.



Senior Associate Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe also raises a 
compelling and well-reasoned point on why the principle of 
conclusiveness of judgment does not apply here. As expertly detailed in 
her Concurring Opinion, the Court's Third Division in the 
Taiwan Kolin case
 could have only allowed the registration of TKC's 
KOLIN
 as a mark with a specific stylization, and not a word mark.
[105]



Indeed, a perusal of the marks involved in the 
Taiwan Kolin case
 would confirm that TKC sought to protect a 
specific style of lettering
 in its trademark application, thereby precluding the possibility that the registration granted in the 
Taiwan Kolin case
 belongs in the category of word marks:
[106]








TKC's opposed Trademark Application No. 4-1996-106310, which was granted registration in the 
Taiwan Kolin case


TKC's Trademark Application No. 4-2002-011002, the alleged "revived version" in the 
Taiwan Kolin case






KOLIN
[107]


(image)
[108]






The two marks overlayed 
 






(image)
 











Thus, even if the CA had found that "[TKC] had authorized KPII to adopt 
and use [its] mark "KOLIN" in the Philippines and to register the mark 
in connection with its business dealings,"
[109]

 the only consequence of TKC's authorization is that KPII was given the 
right to use the exact mark allowed to be registered in the 
Taiwan Kolin case
,
 not a blanket authority to use-or register, for that matter - any and 
all figurative or stylized versions of the word "KOLIN". The Court 
adopts Senior Associate Justice Perlas-Bernabe's insightful disquisition
 on this point, 
viz
.:


x x x [I]t should be discerned that the CA's application of 
res judicata
 in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment failed to take into account the nature of TKC's
 
KOLIN
 mark as a mere design mark, which attribution should consequently limit the legal effects of the [
Taiwan Kolin case
's]
 final judgment. x x x TKC having been adjudged as the owner of a mere 
design mark - could have only assigned to KPII the right to adopt and 
use its mark under the specific stylization and design of 
KOLIN
. x x x
[110]



Consequently, the principle of conclusiveness of judgment cannot apply 
here because the issue involving KPII's use of another figurative or 
stylized version of "KOLIN" ("
kol
i
n
") - or the use of any other figurative or stylized versions of the word "KOLIN" - was not ruled upon in the 
Taiwan Kolin case
.



In light of the foregoing, the Court must therefore determine whether KPII deserves to register its trademark application for 
kol
i
n
, a stylized version of the word "KOLIN", despite KECI's opposition.




II.



KPII'S TRADEMARK APPLICATION IS NOT REGISTRABLE BECAUSE IT WILL CAUSE DAMAGE TO KECI



In its Petition,
[111]
 KECI 
squarely raises the issue of likelihood of confusion, arguing that 
KPII's trademark should not be registered based on, among others, 
Section 123.1(d) of the IP Code, which reads:


SECTION 123. 
Registrability
. - 123.1. A mark cannot be registered if it:






x x x x






 


 


 






(d)


 Is identical with a registered 
mark belonging to a different proprietor or a mark with an earlier 
filing or priority date, in respect of:


















(i) 


The same goods or services, or


















(ii)


 Closely related goods or services, or


















(iii)


 If it nearly resembles such a mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion;


















x x x x  









In determining likelihood of confusion - which can manifest in the form of "confusion of goods" and/or "confusion of business"
[112]
 - several factors may be taken into account, such as:






a) 


the strength of plaintiffs mark;














b) 


the degree of similarity between the plaintiffs and the defendant's marks;














c) 


the proximity of the products or services;














d) 


the likelihood that the plaintiff will bridge the gap;














e) 


evidence of actual confusion;














f) 


the defendant's good faith in adopting the mark;














g)


 the quality of defendant's product or service; and/or 














h) 


the sophistication of the buyers.
[113]






These criteria may be collectively referred to as the 
multifactor test
. Out of these criteria, there are two which are uniformly deemed significant under the Trademark Law
[114]
 and the IP Code:
[115]

 the resemblance of marks (the degree of similarity between the 
plaintiffs and the defendant's marks) and the relatedness of goods or 
services (the proximity of products or services). Nevertheless, the 
other factors also contribute to the finding of likelihood of confusion,
 as will be discussed.



A. Resemblance of marks



The marks involved in this dispute are KECI's 
KOLIN
 and KPII's 
kol
i
n
.
 In assessing the resemblance of marks to determine the existence of 
likelihood of confusion, there are two tests prescribed by 
jurisprudence, 
viz
.:


Jurisprudence has developed two tests in determining similarity and likelihood of confusion in trademark resemblance:


(a) 
the Dominancy Test
 applied in 
Asia Brewery, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals
 and other cases, and



(b) 
the Holistic or Totality Test
 used in 
Del Monte Corporation vs. Court of Appeals
 and its preceding cases.


The Dominancy Test focuses on the similarity of the prevalent features 
of the competing trademarks which might cause confusion or deception, 
and thus infringement. If the competing trademark contains the main, 
essential or dominant features of another, and confusion or deception is
 likely to result, infringement takes place. Duplication or imitation is
 not necessary; nor is it necessary that the infringing label should 
suggest an effort to imitate. The question is whether the use of the 
marks involved is likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of 
the public or deceive purchasers.


On the other hand, the Holistic Test requires that the entirety of the 
marks in question be considered in resolving confusing similarity. 
Comparison of words is not the only determining factor. The trademarks 
in their entirety as they appear in their respective labels or hang tags
 must also be considered in relation to the goods to which they are 
attached. The discerning eye of the observer must focus not only on the 
predominant words but also on the other features appearing in both 
labels in order that he may draw his conclusion whether one is 
confusingly similar to the other.
[116]
 (Emphasis supplied)




Unfortunately, jurisprudence has not been consistent in saying what test
 should be used under what circumstances such that either or both tests 
may viably be employed by the IPO or the courts in finding resemblance 
between marks. As expertly outlined by Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. 
Leonen, there are contradictory lines of jurisprudence advocating the 
use of the Dominancy Test alone,
[117]
 the Holistic Test alone,
[118]
 or both tests.
[119]
 There is also at least one case where the Court did not use either test.
[120]



Needless to say, the current state of jurisprudence in deciding the 
resemblance of marks is unclear. Out of the two tests, however, only the
 Dominancy Test has been incorporated in the IP Code. This was discussed
 in 
McDonald's Corporation v. L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.
,
[121]
 where the Court also observed its own reliance on the dominancy test, thus:


This Court, however, has relied on the dominancy test rather than the holistic test.
 The dominancy test considers the dominant features in the competing marks in determining whether they are confusingly similar. 
Under
 the dominancy test, courts give greater weight to the similarity of the
 appearance of the product arising from the adoption of the dominant 
features of the registered mark, disregarding minor differences. Courts 
will consider more the aural and visual impressions created by the marks
 in the public mind, giving little weight to factors like prices, 
quality, sales outlets and market segments.


x x x x


The test of dominancy is now explicitly incorporated into law in Section 155.1 of the Intellectual Property Code
 which defines infringement as the "colorable imitation of a registered mark x x x or a dominant feature thereof."
[122]
 (Emphasis supplied; italics omitted)



More than an indicator of a mere preference for the Dominancy Test, it 
appears that the legislative intent in explicitly adopting the Dominancy
 Test was to abandon the Holistic Test altogether, as can be seen in the
 legislative deliberations:


Trademarks


Part III of the Code is the new law on trademarks.


x x x x



To 
resolve the conflicting doctrines regarding what constitutes 
colorable imitation of a registered mark, the Code adopts the Dominancy 
Test
 so that any person who uses in commerce any colorable imitation
 of [a] registered mark or a dominant feature thereof shall be liable 
for damages for infringement.


x x x x


Policy Issues


We have summarized the basic features of the proposed Intellectual 
Property Code. Let me now try to identify provisions of the Code that 
may be the focus of policy debates.


Without being exclusive, they are the following:


x x x x


Trademarks


x x x x


8. The committee notes the varying decisions of the Supreme Court regarding colorable imitation of a registered mark. 
There
 are decisions which espouse the Dominancy Test, while there are others 
which use the Holistic Test. We, therefore, recommend the adoption of 
the Dominancy Test to resolve once and for all the debate.
[123]
 (Emphasis supplied)



Considering the adoption of the Dominancy Test and the abandonment of 
the Holistic Test, as confirmed by the provisions of the IP Code and the
 legislative deliberations, 
the Court hereby makes it crystal clear 
that the use of the Holistic Test in determining the resemblance of 
marks has been abandoned
.



The inapplicability of the 
Taiwan Kolin case
 in the case at bar is thus evident. As correctly pointed out by Associate Justice Leonen,
[124]
 the 
Taiwan Kolin case

 used the Holistic Test in evaluating trademark resemblance. This is 
improper precedent because the Dominancy Test is what is prescribed 
under the law.



Using the Dominancy Test, the Court should now determine the resemblance between 
KOLIN
 and 
kol
i
n

 in terms of the similarity of the dominant features used. This is 
consistent with the basic rule in determining resemblance of marks, 
which requires that the appearance, sound, meaning, and overall 
impressions generated by the marks shall be considered.
[125]



In 
Societe Des Produits Nestle, S.A. v. Dy, Jr.
,
[126]

 the Court stated that the marks are confusingly similar based on the 
Dominancy Test because the mark "NANNY" "contains the prevalent feature 
'NAN'" and because the marks are aurally similar, thus:


Applying the dominancy test in the present case, the Court 
finds that "NANNY" is confusingly similar to "NAN." "NAN" is the 
prevalent feature of Nestle's line of infant powdered milk products. It 
is written in bold letters and used in all products. The line consists 
of PRE-NAN, NANÂ­H.A., NAN-1, and NAN-2. 
Clearly, "NANNY" contains the
 prevalent feature "NAN." The first three letters of "NANNY" are exactly
 the same as the letters of "NAN." When "NAN" and "NANNY" are 
pronounced, the aural effect is confusingly similar.
[127]
 (Emphasis supplied)



Applying the Dominancy Test here, KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark resembles KECI's 
KOLIN 
mark because the word "KOLIN" is the prevalent feature of both marks. 
Phonetically or aurally, the marks are exactly the same. Surely, the 
manner of pronouncing the word "KOLIN" does not change just because 
KPII's mark is in lowercase and contains an italicized orange letter 
"i". In terms of connotation and overall impression, there seems to be 
no difference between the two marks.



Another consideration is the type of marks used. Logically, this may 
affect the determination of resemblance of the marks in terms of their 
visual, aural, or connotative aspects, which are key areas to consider 
in using the Dominancy Test.



As summarized in the IPO website,
[128]

 the types of marks allowed to be registered in the Philippines are the 
following: "word mark," "figurative mark," "figurative mark with words,"
 "3D mark," and "stamped or marked containers of goods." Notably, the IP
 Code and the current Trademark Regulations do not define these terms 
and how they impact the finding of resemblance between marks. However, 
IPOPHL Memorandum Circular No. 17-010, 
Rules and Regulations on Trademarks, Service Marks, Trade names and Marked or Stamped Containers
 makes an explicit reference to "word marks," as follows:


RULE 402. 
Reproduction of the Mark
.
 - x x x


In the case of 
word marks
 or if no special characteristics have 
to be shown, such as design, style of lettering, color, diacritical 
marks, or unusual forms of punctuation, the mark must be represented in 
standard characters. The specification of the mark to be reproduced will
 be indicated in the application form and/or published on the website.


x x x x



That word marks protect the word itself stands to reason. Since there 
are no special characteristics to be shown in the reproduction of the 
mark in the application, the word itself is the subject of protection. 
This understanding of the protection given to word marks is also 
consistent with trademark jurisprudence in the United States, where most
 of our intellectual property laws were patterned from.
[129]





The case of 
Cunningham v. Laser Golf Corp.
[130]
 (
Cunningham
) may be considered relevant in this jurisdiction. In 
Cunningham
,
 Laser Golf, the prior user and registrant of the "LASER" mark for golf 
clubs and golf balls, filed a cancellation case against Cunningham's 
registration for "LASERSWING" for golf clubs. Since Cunningham's 
"LASERSWING" registration was cancelled, he sought before the court a 
review of the decision cancelling his registration. One of Cunningham's 
arguments was that the appearance of his mark in commerce is 
distinguishable from the mark of Laser Golf in the sense that he uses 
"particular colors and a particular font", "specific arrangements of 
lower and upper case", "colored whoosh stripes", and a "juxtaposition of
 the main brand name". In ruling that this was not enough to avoid 
confusion, the U.S. court pertinently stated:


However, Cunningham's argument is inapposite to our review of this cancellation proceeding. The record shows that 
the registration for the LASERSWING mark contains a "typed drawing." ...
Registrations
 with typed drawings are not limited to any particular rendition of the 
mark and, in particular, are not limited to the mark as it is used in 
commerce
. See 
Vornado, Inc. v. Breuer Elec. Mfg. Co.
, 
C.C.P.A. 858, 390 F.2d 724, 727, 156 USPQ 340, 342 (1968) (stating that 
because the registration for the senior mark, upon which the opposition 
was based, disclosed only the word, "
the [advertising] display of the
 mark in a particular style is of no material significance since the 
display may be changed at any time as may be dictated by the fancy of 
the applicant or the owner of the mark

 (Emphasis and underscoring ours)




Using the persuasive logic in 
Cunningham
 together with the Dominancy Test, there is no doubt that the minor differences between 
kol
i
n
 and 
KOLIN
 mark should be completely disregarded. The fact that KPII's trademark application possesses special characteristics (
e.g.
, the italicized orange letter "i") not present in KECI's 
KOLIN

 word mark makes no difference in terms of appearance, sound, 
connotation, or overall impression because the "KOLIN" word itself is 
the subject of KECI's registration.



B. Relatedness of Goods/Services



The goods involved in the case at bar are as follows:








KECI's 
KOLIN
 


KPII's 
kol
i
n






Automatic Voltage Regulator, 
Converter, Recharger, Stereo Booster, AC-DC Regulated Power Supply, 
Step-Down Transformer, PA Amplified AC-DC.


Televisions, DVD Players







In assessing relatedness of goods/services to determine likelihood of confusion, 
Mighty Corporation
 provides a list of factors that should be considered, 
viz
.:


Non-competing goods may be those which, though they are not 
in actual competition, are so related to each other that it can 
reasonably be assumed that they originate from one manufacturer, in 
which case, confusion of business can arise out of the use of similar 
marks. They may also be those which, being entirely unrelated, cannot be
 assumed to have a common source; hence, there is no confusion of 
business, even though similar marks are used. Thus, there is no 
trademark infringement if the public does not expect the plaintiff to 
make or sell the same class of goods as those made or sold by the 
defendant.


 



 
In resolving whether goods are related, several factors come into play:






(a)


 the business (and its location) to which the goods belong














(b) 


the class of product to which the goods belong














(c) 


the product's quality, quantity, or size, including the nature of the package, wrapper or container














(d) 


the nature and cost of the articles














(e) 


the descriptive properties, physical 
attributes or essential characteristics with reference to their form, 
composition, texture or quality














(f) 


the purpose of the goods














(g)


 whether the article is bought for immediate consumption, that is, day-to-day household items














(h) 


the fields of manufacture














(i) 


the conditions under which the article is usually purchased and














j) 


the channels of trade through which the goods flow, how they are distributed, marketed, displayed and sold.






The wisdom of this approach is its recognition that each trademark 
infringement case presents its own unique set of facts. No single factor
 is preeminent, nor can the presence or absence of one determine, 
without analysis of the others, the outcome of an infringement suit. 
Rather, the court is required to sift the evidence relevant to each of 
the criteria. 
This requires that the entire panoply of elements constituting the relevant factual landscape be comprehensively examined.

 It is a weighing and balancing process. With reference to this ultimate
 question, and from a balancing of the determinations reached on all of 
the factors, a conclusion is reached whether the parties have a right to
 the relief sought.
[132]
 (Emphasis supplied)



Indeed, a 
comprehensive
 examination of all these factors is 
needed to ensure that pronouncements on legal relatedness are not based 
on skewed factual premises, especially since relatedness of 
goods/services significantly impacts the finding of likelihood of 
confusion as mentioned above.



Too, because of the importance of relatedness of goods/services in 
deciding controversies involving the issue of likelihood of confusion of
 marks, the Court 
en banc
 takes a closer look at one factor inconsistent with our laws and creates problems with making precedents on legal relatedness.



As astutely explained by Chief Justice Diosdado M. Peralta,
[133]

 the NCL serves purely administrative purposes - merely a way for 
trademark offices worldwide to organize the thousands of applications 
that are filed - and the classification of products/services should not 
have been included as one of the factors in determining relatedness 
because there was 
no legal basis for its inclusion
. In fact, it even contradicts specific provisions of the Trademark Law
[134]
 and the IP Code.
[135]

 The use of classification of products/services in determining 
relatedness also conflicts with a provision of the 2020 Revised Rules of
 Procedure for Intellectual Property Rights Cases,
[136]
 
viz
.:


SECTION 6. 
Likelihood of Confusion; Determination of Related Goods or Services
.
 - Goods or services may not be considered as being similar or 
dissimilar to each other on the ground that, in any registration or 
publication by the Office, they appear in the same or different classes 
of the Nice Classification.



Allowing this factor to remain as a criterion in determining legal 
relatedness would not be merely inconsequential. In fact, it may even 
create problems in jurisprudential precedents on legal relatedness due 
to the principle of 
stare decisis
.



The Classes in the NCL undergo several changes each year. To illustrate,
 the Alphabetical List of Goods in Class 9 underwent several changes in 
2017,
[137]
 2018,
[138]
 2019,
[139]
 and 2020.
[140]

 Significantly, "socks, electrically heated" was changed from being a 
Class 9 product to a Class 11 product in 2017, showing that the 
classification of the specific goods per class is still subject to 
change. Surely, jurisprudential pronouncements regarding the nature of 
certain goods/services and their legal relatedness/nonÂ­ relatedness to 
each other-which pronouncements would, in turn, effectively affect 
substantive rights over marks and affect future cases involving the same
 goods or services-should not be made to depend on a constantly changing
 list.




 




Considering the foregoing discussion, 
the Court hereby abandons the use of product or service classification as a factor in determining relatedness or non-relatedness
.



In this light, the inapplicability of the 
Taiwan Kolin
 case as 
precedent in the instant controversy becomes all the more apparent 
because it did not comprehensively consider all the jurisprudential 
factors in determining relatedness and it included an inapposite 
discussion on subcategories in the NCL as an additional rationale for 
its conclusion on non-relatedness.



Based on the evidence on record and reasonable inferences in accord with
 common experience, the factors to determine relatedness in 
Mighty Corporation
 yields the conclusion that the goods covered by 
KOLIN
 and 
kol
i
n
 are related, as seen in the following table:








(d) the nature and cost of the articles


Goods covered by 
KOLIN
 and 
kol
i
n

 are electronic m nature, relatively expensive, and rarely bought. It 
will likely take several years before consumers would make repeat 
purchases of the goods involved.






(e) the descriptive properties, 
physical attributes or essential characteristics with reference to their
 form, composition, texture or quality


Considering that they are electronic goods, goods covered by 
KOLIN
 and 
kol
i
n

 are likely made of metal. It is also likely that such goods cannot be 
easily carried around and are usually brought back to the consumer's 
place after being bought.






(f) the purpose of the goods


The audiovisual goods covered by 
kol
i
n
 (Television and DVD players) and 
KOLIN
 (stereo booster) marks can be used for entertainment purposes.






(g) whether the article is bought for immediate consumption, that is, day-to-day household items


Goods covered by 
KOLIN
 and 
kol
i
n
 are not bought for immediate consumption.






(i) the conditions under which the article is usually purchased, and


Because they are relatively expensive and they last for a long time, goods covered by 
KOLIN
 and 
kol
i
n
 are rarely bought. They are non-essential goods.






(j) the channels of trade through which the goods flow, how they are distributed, marketed, displayed and sold.


The goods covered by 
KOLIN 
and 
kol
i
n
 marks will likely be offered in "the same channels of trade such as department stores or appliance stores".
[141]
 





 




 

Clearly, the goods covered by 
KOLIN
 and 
kol
i
n
 are related, and this legal relatedness significantly impacts a finding of likelihood of confusion.



In addition to the factors in 
Mighty Corporation
, another ground for finding relatedness of goods/services is their complementarity.



The reasoning used in the case of 
Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P. v. Vudu, Inc.
[142]
 is also logical and persuasive. In said case, the opposer Hewlett-Packard registered its "VOODOO" mark for, 
inter alia
, "personal and gaming computers" under Class 9. Meanwhile, Vudu, Inc. sought to register its "VUDU" mark for, 
inter alia
,
 "computer software for use in computers for the transmission, storage 
and playback of audio and video content" also under Class 9. The 
tribunal therein pointed out that "the goods of the parties may be used 
together for the same purposes, may be found in the same channels of 
trade, and may appeal to the same purchasers. x x x [B]y their 
descriptions, [VUDU's] particular type of software for computers and 
[Hewlett-Packard's] personal and gaming computers are 
complementary goods
",
 thus, it granted Hewlett-Packard's opposition of the "VUDU" mark based 
on the finding that the goods under Class 9 covered by the marks are 
related and confusion is likely.
[143]



Applying this reasoning to the herein dispute, it is clear that the goods covered by KECI's
 
KOLIN
 are complementary to the goods covered by KPII's 
kol
i
n

 and could thus be considered as related. This increases the likelihood 
that consumers will at least think that the goods come from the same 
source. In other words, confusion of business will likely arise.



C. Actual Confusion



The IPO-BLA stated that there is already actual confusion among consumers regarding the goods of KECI and KPII:


More so, [KECPs] evidence consisting of various e-mails x x x
 it received from public consumers reflecting their complaints, 
concerns, and other information about [KPII's] goods as televisions, 
air-conditioning units and DVD players, are obvious showing of actual 
confusion of goods as well as confusion as to origin or source [of] 
goods. These reveal factual confusion of the buying public between the 
marks in controversy.
[144]







 




The presence of actual confusion is not an insignificant circumstance. 
Indeed, the evidence of actual confusion is often considered the most 
persuasive evidence of likelihood of confusion because past confusion is
 frequently a strong indicator of future confusion.
[145]





It is the Court's considered view that evidence of actual confusion 
should be considered as strong evidence of likelihood of confusion, 
especially when there are concurrent findings of resemblance of marks 
and/or relatedness of the goods/services. If "likelihood of confusion" 
is already abhorred by the infringement provisions
[146]
 of the law and the evidence of likelihood of confusion already creates basis to prevent another's use of its mark, 
it should logically follow that 
actual confusion
 should be given more weight because confusion among consumers is not only speculated but has actually transpired
.



Parenthetically, the presence of this criterion in ascertaining the 
existence of likelihood of confusion in the multifactor test is yet 
another reason why the 
Taiwan Kolin case
 should not be held as a binding precedent here. In the 
Taiwan Kolin case
, while there was evidence of actual confusion presented in the IPO-BLA,
[147]
 this was ultimately not considered in resolving the issue of likelihood of confusion.



D. Normal Potential Expansion of Business



The factor involving the "likelihood that the plaintiff will bridge the 
gap" pertains to the possibility that the plaintiff will expand its 
product offerings to cover the product areas of the defendant.
[148]



In the case of 
Dermaline, Inc. v. Myra Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
,
[149]
 the Court already acknowledged "that the registered trademark owner enjoys protection in product and market areas that are 
the normal potential expansion of his business
."
[150]
 As well, 
Societe Des Produits Nestle, S.A. v. Dy, Jr.
[151]
 describes the scope of protection given to registrants as follows:


The scope of protection afforded to registered trademark owners is not limited to protection from infringers with 
identical goods
. The scope of protection extends to protection from infringers with 
related goods
, and to 
market areas that are the normal expansion of business
 of the registered trademark owners. x x x
[152]
 (Emphasis supplied)



As stated above, the goods covered by 
KOLIN
 and 
kol
i
n
 are related. Therefore, it is likely that the goods covered by 
kol
i
n
 falls within the normal potential expansion of business of KECI.



E. Sophistication of the buyers



As stated in 
Philip Morris, Inc. v. Fortune Tobacco Corporation
,
[153]
 "the general impression of the ordinary purchaser, 
buying
 under the normally prevalent conditions in trade and giving the 
attention such purchasers usually give in buying that class of goods
, is the touchstone."
[154]



The goods covered by 
KOLIN
 and 
kol
i
n
 
are not inexpensive goods and consumers may pay more attention in buying
 these goods. However, this does not eliminate the possibility of 
confusion, especially since most consumers likely do not frequently 
purchase Automatic Voltage Regulators, stereo boosters, TV sets, DVD 
players, etc. Unless they have jobs or hobbies that allow them to 
frequently purchase these electronic products, it is not farfetched to 
suppose that they may only encounter the marks in the marketplace itself
 once they are about to buy said goods once every five years or so.



Consequently, while consumers may concededly be familiar with these 
goods to some extent, such familiarity will likely not be an intimate 
knowledge thereof associated with the frequent and repeated purchase of 
said goods.



It is not difficult to imagine that ordinary purchasers looking to buy a
 home entertainment set for their homes would likely not know that the 
"XYZ" - branded stereo boosters and the "XYZ" - branded televisions they
 encounter in the store are offered by different companies. If the 
consumer happens to like the "XYZ" brand for the stereo boosters after 
seeing it for the first time, said consumer will most likely associate 
it with the "XYZ" brand for television set and vice versa, especially 
since these goods are complementary to each other.



Even if sophisticated consumers are making a repeat purchase years after
 they first bought a "KOLIN" product, confusion is still possible 
because of the degree of similarity of the subject marks. As mentioned 
above, KECI's 
KOLIN
 mark is a word mark. Stated simply, 
the goodwill over the products will likely be associated with the 
"KOLIN" word among consumers' minds, regardless of their sophistication.
 Thus, these consumers who prefer KECI's products will likely go into 
stores asking and looking for the "KOLIN" brand, regardless of its 
stylization or additional figurative features. If they happen to see 
KPII's "KOLIN" - branded products, they may not readily know that the 
products come from another source and mistakenly purchase those products
 thinking that these products are from KECL Any perceived visual 
differences between KECI's and KPII's "KOLIN" mark will likely be 
disregarded, especially considering that it is not unusual for companies
 to rebrand and overhaul their "brand image", including their logos, 
every so often.



Ultimately, there is no need to speculate and imagine how an average 
consumer would think and act in this hypothetical situation because, as 
discussed, there is actual proof of confusion among consumers between 
the 
KOLIN
 and 
kol
i
n
 goods.
[155]
 
It is clear that consumers have actually associated KPII's "KOLIN" - branded products with KECI's business.

 To be sure, that consumers have complained about KPII's products and 
associated the quality of such products with KECI's business shows that 
the concurrent use of "KOLIN" by KPII had already unfairly smeared 
KECI's goodwill and reputation over its products.



F. Strength of the Mark



The factor on "strength of plaintiffs mark" pertains to the degree of distinctiveness of marks,
[156]
 which can be divided into five categories
[157]
 enumerated in decreasing order of strength below:






1) 


Coined or fanciful marks - invented words or signs that have no real meaning (
e.g.
, Google, Kodak). These marks are the strongest and have the greatest chance of being registered.














2) 


Arbitrary marks
[158]
 - words that have a meaning but have no logical relation to a product (
e.g.
, SUNNY as a mark covering mobile phones, APPLE in relation to computers/phones).














3) 


Suggestive marks
[159]
 - marks that hint at the nature, quality or attributes of the product, without describing these attributes (
e.g.
,
 SUNNY for lamps, which would hint that the product will bring light to 
homes). If not considered as bordering on descriptive, this may be 
allowed.














4) 


Descriptive marks
[160]

 - describe the feature of the product such as quality, type, efficacy, 
use, shape, etc. The registration of descriptive marks is generally not 
allowed under the IP Code.
[161]














5) 


Generic marks
[162]
 - words or signs that name the species or object to which they apply (
e.g.
, CHAIR in relation to chairs). They are not eligible for protection as marks under the IP Code.
[163]







KECI's 
KOLIN
 mark is a fanciful or coined mark. 
Considering that it is highly distinctive, confusion would be likely if 
someone else were to be allowed to concurrently use such mark in 
commerce.



G. Bad Faith



The discussion of bad faith in the case of 
Zuneca Pharmaceutical v. Natrapharm, Inc.
[164]
 is instructive:


The concepts of bad faith and fraud were defined in 
MustangÂ­Bekleidungswerke GmbH + Co. KG v. Hung Chiu Ming
, a case decided by the Office of the Director General of the IPO under the Trademark Law, as amended, 
viz
.:


What constitutes fraud or bad faith in trademark 
registration? Bad faith means that the applicant or registrant has 
knowledge of prior creation, use and/or registration by another of an 
identical or similar trademark. In other words, it is copying and using 
somebody else's trademark. Fraud, on the other hand, may be committed by
 making false claims in connection with the trademark application and 
registration, particularly on the issues of origin, ownership, and use 
of the trademark in question among other things.


The concept of 'fraud contemplated above is not a mere inaccurate claim 
as to the origin, ownership, and use of the trademark. In civil law, the
 concept of fraud has been defined as the deliberate intention to cause 
damage or prejudice. The same principle applies in the context of 
trademark registrations: 
fraud is intentionally making false claims 
to take advantage of another's goodwill thereby causing damage or 
prejudice to another
. Indeed, the concepts of bad faith and fraud go
 hand-in-hand in this context. There is no distinction between the 
concepts of bad faith and fraud in trademark registrations because the 
existence of one necessarily presupposes the existence of the other.
[165]
 (Emphasis supplied)




To recall, the 
KECI ownership case
, promulgated on July 31, 2006, ruled that KECI is the owner of the 
KOLIN

 mark under the Trademark Law, despite TKC's opposition that confusion 
is likely because it had foreign registrations for "KOLIN" and a local 
trademark application for 
KOLIN
. Thereafter, KPII (TKC's affiliate) filed a trademark application for 
kol
i
n
 covering the same goods.



While KECI had squarely alleged the issue of KPII's bad faith,
[166]

 there was no explicit finding of bad faith on the part of KPII in the 
decisions of the IPO-BLA, IPO-DG, and the CA. After an examination of 
the records, however, the Court finds that circumstances in this case 
would lead a reasonable mind to conclude that KPII knew about KECI's 
KOLIN
 registration when it made a trademark application for 
kol
i
n
.





First, there was a factual finding by the IPO-BLA that KPII is an 
instrumentality of TKC and TKC directly participates in the management, 
supervision, and control of KPII, 
viz
:


An exhaustive scrutiny of the records of the case 
convince[s] this Bureau to concur with the position of [KECI] that 
indeed, [KPII] is an instrumentality of [TKC]. [KECI] presented 
substantial evidence that [KPII] is effectively under the management, 
supervision and control of [TKC] manifested through the assignment of 
five (5) persons to the financial and plant operations x x x; 
[TKC's] admission of its direct participation in the management, supervision and control of [KPII]

 x x x; [TKC's] majority ownership of stocks in [KPII] x x x; and the 
maintenance of one website of both companies and the admission to the 
same x x x.
[167]
 (Emphasis supplied)



Second, as found by the CA,
[168]
 KPII was authorized by TKC to use the "KOLIN" mark.



Third, KPII filed a trademark application for 
kol
i
n
 barely two months after KECI was declared as the owner of the 
KOLIN
 mark.



Fourth, KECI and KPII may be considered as being in the same line of 
business and it would have been highly improbable that KPII did not know
 an existing 
KOLIN
 mark owned by KECI, especially since it is an affiliate of TKC. Notably, in the case of 
Birkenstock Orthopaedie GmbH and Co. KG v. Phil. Shoe Expo Marketing Corp.
,
[169]

 the Court agreed with the IPO's finding that the party was in bad faith
 because it was in the same line of business and it was highly 
improbable for it to not know of the existence of BIRKENSTOCK before it 
appropriated and registered this "highly distinct" mark.
[170]



Thus, there exists relevant evidence and factual findings that a 
reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion that 
KPII was in bad faith.



To summarize the above discussion: (1) there is resemblance between KECI's 
KOLIN
 and KPII's 
kol
i
n
 marks; (2) the goods covered by KECI's 
KOLIN

 are related to the goods covered by KPII's kolin; (3) there is evidence
 of actual confusion between the two marks; (4) the goods covered by 
KPII's 
kol
i
n
 fall within the normal potential 
expansion of business of KECI; (5) sophistication of buyers is not 
enough to eliminate confusion; (6) KPII's adoption of KECI's coined and 
fanciful mark would greatly contribute to likelihood of confusion; and 
(7) KPII applied for 
kol
i
n
 in bad faith. Thus, KPII's application for 
kol
i
n
 should be denied because it would cause likelihood of confusion and KECI's rights would be damaged.




* * *


It must also be stressed that KECI was already declared as the owner of the 
KOLIN
 mark under the Trademark Law. Section 236
[171]

 of the IP Code states that nothing in the IP Code - which, as 
mentioned, logically includes registrations made pursuant thereto - 
shall adversely affect the rights of the enforcement of marks acquired 
in good faith prior to the effective date of said law.





 




As seen above, the existence of likelihood of confusion is already 
considered as damage that would be sufficient to sustain the opposition 
and rejection of KPII's trademark application. More than that, however, 
the Court is likewise cognizant that, by granting this registration, 
KPII would acquire exclusive rights over the stylized version of KOLIN 
("
kol
i
n
") for a range of goods/services,
[172]
 
i.e.
,
 covered goods, related goods/services, goods/services falling within 
the normal potential expansion of KPII's business. Owing to the peculiar
 circumstances of this case, this will effectively amount to a 
curtailment of KECI's right to freely use and enforce the KOLIN word 
mark, or any stylized version thereof, for its own range of 
goods/services, especially against KPII, 
regardless of the existence of actual confusion
. Thus, based on Section 122
[173]
 vis-a-vis Section 236
[174]
 of the IP Code, the Court cannot give due course to KPII's trademark application for "
kol
i
n
".

 The relevant excerpt in Birkenstock reads:


In view of the foregoing circumstances, the Court finds the 
petitioner to be the true and lawful owner of the mark "BIRKENSTOCK" and
 entitled to its registration, and that respondent was in bad faith in 
having it registered in its name. In this regard, the Court quotes with 
approval the words of the IPO Director General, 
viz
.:


The facts and evidence fail to show that [respondent] was in good faith in using and in registering the mark BIRKENSTOCK. 
BIRKENSTOCK,
 obviously of German origin, is a highly distinct and arbitrary mark. It
 is very remote that two persons did coin the same or identical marks. 
To come up with a highly distinct and uncommon mark previously 
appropriated by another, for use in the same line of business, and 
without any plausible explanation, is incredible.
 The field from 
which a person may select a trademark is practically unlimited. As in 
all other cases of colorable imitations, the unanswered riddle is why, 
of the millions of terms and combinations of letters and designs 
available, [respondent] had to come up with a mark identical or so 
closely similar to the [petitioner's] if there was no intent to take 
advantage of the goodwill generated by the [petitioner's] mark. 
Being
 on the same line of business, it is highly probable that the 
[respondent] knew of the existence of BIRKENSTOCK and its use by the 
[petitioner], before [respondent] appropriated the same mark and had it 
registered in its name.

SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION
LEONEN, J.:



I concur in the result.



I agree with the 
ponencia
's finding that Kolin Philippines 
International, Inc.'s Application No. 4-2006-010021, for the mark 
"KOLIN" in Class 9, should be rejected on the basis of Kolin Electronics
 Co. Inc.'s valid and subsisting Registration No. 4-1993-087497 for the 
mark "KOLIN" in Class 9.



Section 147.1 of Republic Act No. 8293, as amended, otherwise known as 
the Intellectual Property Code, grants a registered mark's owner the 
exclusive right to prevent a third party from using an identical or 
similar sign in the course of trade, if the use would result in a 
likelihood of confusion.


Here, the "KOLIN" mark in Application No. 4-2006-010021 is demonstrably 
identical or similar to the mark "KOLIN" in Registration No. 
4-1993-087497.
[1]
 The intent 
and purpose of Application No. 4-2006-010021 is for Kolin Philippines 
International, Inc. to use its "KOLIN" mark in trade. The likelihood of,
 and even actual confusion was noted by the Intellectual Property 
Office-Bureau of Legal Affairs to be proven by queries from consumers 
directed to Kolin Electronics Co. Inc. regarding Kolin Philippines 
International, Inc.'s goods.
[2]

 This likelihood of or actual confusion as to the origin of goods these 
companies sell is the damage that may be or has been sustained by Kolin 
Electronics Co. Inc., the oppositor to Kolin Philippines International, 
Inc.'s trademark application.
[3]

 The Bureau of Legal Affairs and the Director-General of the 
Intellectual Property Office correctly sustained Kolin Electronics Co. 
Inc.'s opposition.



Likewise, I concur that the March 25, 2015 Decision of this Court's Third Division in 
Taiwan Kolin Corp. Ltd. v. Kolin Electronics Co., Inc.
[4]
 (
Taiwan Kolin
) is not 
res judicata
 to this case.
[5]
 Kolin Philippines International, Inc.'s status as an affiliate
[6]
 company of Taiwan Kolin Corp. Ltd., which owns Registration No. 4-1996-106310 for the mark "KOLIN" in Class 9 is immaterial.
[7]
 
Taiwan Kolin

 should not serve as a bar to Kolin Electronics Co. Inc. opposing 
applications for, or seeking the cancellation of, any other mark which 
may damage it or diminish its rights to Registration No. 4-1993-078497. 
There is nothing in 
Taiwan Kolin
 that stipulated Taiwan Kolin 
Corp. Ltd.'s Registration No. 4-1996-106310's absolute dominion over any
 and all marks for "KOLIN" in Class 9, to the exclusion of Kolin 
Electronics Co. Inc.'s subsisting Registration No. 4-1993-078497. To 
otherwise bar Kolin Electronics Co. Inc. from doing so is to diminish 
its rights under Section 147.1 of the Intellectual Property Code, 
resulting from its valid registration.
[8]





However, with all due respect, I disagree with the 
ponencia
's 
ruling on the longstanding issue of how likelihood of confusion is 
determined in trade and service marks based on our jurisprudence in 
relation to the Intellectual Property Code.


I



Entrenched in Article 8 of the Civil Code,
[9]
 the principle of 
stare decisis
 et non quieta movere
 requires our courts to follow rules established in this Court's final decisions:


The principle of 
stare decisis
 enjoins adherence to 
judicial precedents. It requires courts in a country to follow the rule 
established in a decision of its Supreme Court. That decision becomes a 
judicial precedent to be followed in subsequent cases by all courts in 
the land. The doctrine is based on the principle that once a question of
 law has been examined and decided, it should be deemed settled and 
closed to further argument.
[10]
 (Citation omitted)




When this Court has laid down a legal principle applicable to a 
particular set of facts, that principle must be applied to all 
succeeding cases of similar factual antecedents, regardless of the 
identity of the parties or objects under litigation. Predictable 
application of judicial precedents ensures certainty in adjudication:


Under the doctrine, when the Supreme Court has once laid 
down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it 
will adhere to that principle, and apply it to all future cases, where 
facts are substantially the same; regardless of whether the parties and 
property are the same. The doctrine of 
stare decisis
 is based upon the legal principle or rule involved and not upon the judgment which results therefrom. In this particular sense 
stare decisis
 differs from 
res judicata
 which is based upon the judgment.




The doctrine of 
stare decisis
 is one of policy grounded on the necessity for securing certainty and stability of judicial decisions, thus:


Time and again, the Court has held that it is a very 
desirable and necessary judicial practice that when a court has laid 
down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it 
will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases in which 
the facts are substantially the same. Stare decisis et non quieta 
movere. Stand by the decisions and disturb not what is settled. Stare 
decisis simply means that for the sake of certainty, a conclusion 
reached in one case should be applied to those that follow if the facts 
are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. It
 proceeds from the first principle of justice that, absent any powerful 
countervailing considerations, like cases ought to be decided alike. 
Thus, where the same questions relating to the same event have been put 
forward by the parties similarly situated as in a previous case 
litigated and decided by a competent court, the rule of 
stare decisis
 is a bar to any attempt to relitigate the same issue.
[11]
 (Citations omitted, emphasis in the original)



Because of this, whenever possible, potentially conflicting doctrines 
laid down by this Court are harmonized, read together, subjected to 
exceptions, or distinguished, rather than outright abandoned.
[12]



Nonetheless, the salutary goal of consistency must not amount to stubbornly perpetuating errors. In 
Philippine Trust Company v. Mitchell
:
[13]


Is the court with new membership compelled to follow blindly the doctrine of the Velasco case? The rule of 
stare decisis

 is entitled to respect. Stability in the law, particularly in the 
business field, is desirable. But idolatrous reverence for precedent, 
simply as precedent, no longer rules. More important than anything else 
is that the court should be right. And particularly is it not wise to 
subordinate legal reason to case law and by so doing perpetuate error 
when it is brought to mind that the views now expressed conform in 
principle to the original decision and that since the first decision to 
the contrary was sent forth there has existed a respectable opinion of 
non-conformity in the court. Indeed, on at least one occasion has the 
court broken away from the revamped doctrine, while even in the last 
case in point the court was as evenly divided as it was possible to be 
and still reach a decision.
[14]



The abandonment of established doctrines becomes necessary when motivated by strong and compelling reasons
[15]
 based on changes in law or public policy, evolving conditions, or the most pressing considerations of justice.



In 
Villaflor v. Summers
,
[16]
 this Court refused to follow United States cases in deciding the extent of the right to self-incrimination in this country:


So much for the authorities. For the nonce we would prefer 
to forget them entirely, and here in the Philippines, being in the 
agreeable state of breaking new ground, would rather desire our decision
 to rest on a strong foundation of reason and justice than on a weak one
 of blind adherence to tradition and precedent. Moreover, we believe 
that an unbiased consideration of the history of the constitutional 
provision will disclose that our conclusion is in exact accord with the 
causes which led to its adoption.
[17]



In 
Tan Chong v. Secretary of Labor
,
[18]

 this Court overturned prior cases that bestowed citizenship based on 
jus soli because their application would violate the law which was then 
in force:


The principle of 
stare decisis
 does not mean blind 
adherence to precedents. The doctrine or rule laid down, which has been 
followed for years, no matter how sound it may be, if found to be 
contrary to law, must be abandoned. The principle of 
stare decisis

 does not and should not apply when there is conflict between the 
precedent and the law. The duty of this Court is to forsake and abandon 
any doctrine or rule found to be in violation of the law in force.



....


Considering that the common law principle or rule of 
jus soli
 
obtaining in England and in the United States, as embodied in the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, has never
 been extended to this jurisdiction (section 1, Act of 1 July 1902; sec.
 5, Act of 29 August 1916); considering that the law in force and 
applicable to the petitioner and the applicant in the two cases at the 
time of their birth is sec. 4 of the Philippine Bill (Act of 1 July 
1902), as amended by Act of 23 March 1912, which provides that only 
those "inhabitants of the Philippine Islands continuing to reside 
therein who were Spanish subjects on the 11th day of April, 1899; and 
then resided in said Islands, and their children born subsequent 
thereto, shall be deemed and held to be citizens of the Philippine 
Islands," we are of the opinion and so hold that the petitioner in the 
first case and the applicant in the second case, who were born of alien 
parentage, were not and are not, under said section, citizens of the 
Philippine Islands.
[19]



In 
Urbano v. Chavez
,
[20]

 this Court abandoned a series of cases that had previously authorized 
the Office of the Solicitor General to represent a public official at 
any stage of a criminal case. It did so by finding anomalous the 
consequences of this authority:


However, under the doctrine announced in 
Anti-Graft League of the Philippines, Inc.
 and 
Garrido
,
 the Office of the Solicitor General is authorized to enter its 
appearance as counsel for any public official, against whom a criminal 
charge had been instituted, during the preliminary investigation stage 
thereof. Nevertheless, in the same case, this Court held that once an 
information is filed against the public official, the Office of the 
Solicitor General can no longer represent the said official in the 
litigation. The anomaly in this paradigm becomes obvious when, in the 
event of a judgment of conviction, the case is brought on appeal to the 
appellate courts. The Office of the Solicitor General, as the appellate 
counsel of the People of the Philippines, is expected to take a stand 
against the accused. More often than not, it does. Accordingly, there is
 a clear conflict of interest here, and one which smacks of ethical 
considerations, where the Office of the Solicitor General, as counsel 
for the public official, defends the latter in the preliminary 
investigation stage of the criminal case, and where the same office, as 
appellate counsel of the People of the Philippines, represents the 
prosecution when the case is brought on appeal. This anomalous situation
 could not have been contemplated and allowed by the law, its 
unconditional terms and provisions notwithstanding. It is a situation 
which cannot be countenanced by the Court.


Otherwise, if the Solicitor General who represents the state on appeal 
in criminal cases can appear for the accused public official in a 
preliminary investigation, then by the same token a provincial or city 
fiscal, his assistant or any government prosecutor who represents the 
People of the Philippines at the preliminary investigation of a case up 
to the trial thereof can appear for an accused public official at the 
preliminary investigation being conducted by another fiscal, prosecutor 
or municipal judge. The situation would simply be scandalous, to say the
 least.




There is likewise another reason, as earlier discussed, why the Office 
of the Solicitor General cmmot represent an accused in a criminal case. 
Inasmuch as the State can speak and act only by law, whatever it does 
say and do must be lawful, and that which is unlawful is not the word or
 deed of the State, but is the mere wrong or trespass of those 
individual persons who falsely speak and act in its name. Therefore, the
 accused public official should not expect the State, through the Office
 of the Solicitor General, to defend him for a wrongful act which cannot
 be attributed to the State itself. In the same light, a public official
 who is sued in a criminal case is actually sued in his personal 
capacity inasmuch as his principal, the State, can never be the author 
of a wrongful act, much less commit a crime.


Thus, the Court rules that the Office of the Solicitor General is not 
authorized to represent a public official at any stage of a criminal 
case. For this reason, the doctrine announced in 
Anti-Grafl League of the Philippines, Inc. v. Hon. Ortega and Solicitor General v. Garrido
,
 and all decided cases affirming the same; in so far as they are 
inconsistent with this pronouncement, should be deemed abandoned. The 
principle of 
stare decisis
 notwithstanding, it is well-settled 
that a doctrine which should be abandoned or modified should be 
abandoned or modified accordingly. After all, more important than 
anything else is that this Court should be right.
[21]
 (Citation omitted)



Thirty years after the promulgation of 
Gerona v. Secretary of Education
,
[22]
 this Court overturned the compulsory nature of school flag salutes in 
Ebralinag v. The Division of Superintendent of Schools of Cebu
[23]
 as a recognition of the fundamental right to religious freedom:


Our task here is extremely difficult, for the 30-year-old 
decision of this Court in Gerona upholding the flag salute law and 
approving the expulsion of students who refuse to obey it, is not 
lightly to be trifled with.


It is somewhat ironic however, that after the Gerona ruling had received
 legislative cachet by its incorporation in the Administrative Code of 
1987, the present Court believes that the time has come to reexamine it.
 The idea that one may be compelled to salute the flag, sing the 
national anthem, and recite the patriotic pledge, during a flag ceremony
 on pain of being dismissed from one's job or of being expelled from 
school, is alien to the conscience of the present generation of 
Filipinos who cut their teeth on the Bill of Rights which guarantees 
their rights to free speech ** and the free exercise of religious 
profession and worship[.]
[24]




Likewise, this Court in 
Ebralinag
 also found that the dire situations feared in 
Gerona
 did not actually occur:


The situation that the Court directly predicted in Gerona that:


"[T]he flag ceremony will become a thing of the past or 
perhaps conducted with very few participants, and the time will come 
when we would have citizens untaught and uninculcated in and not imbued 
with reverence for the flag and love of country, admiration for national
 heroes, and patriotism - a pathetic, even tragic situation, and all 
because a small portion of the school population imposed its will, 
demanded and was granted an exemption."


has not come to pass. We are not persuaded that by exempting the 
Jehovah's Witnesses from saluting the flag, singing the national anthem 
and reciting the patriotic pledge, this religious which admittedly 
comprises a "small portion of the school population" will shake up our 
part of the globe and suddenly produce a nation "untaught and 
uninculcated in and unimbued with reverence for the flag, patriotism, 
love of country and admiration for national heroes[.]" ... After all, 
what the petitioners seek only is exemption from the flag ceremony, not 
exclusion from the public schools where they may study the Constitution,
 the democratic way of life and form of government, and learn not only 
the arts, science, Philippine history and culture but also receive 
training for a vocation or profession and be taught the virtues of 
patriotism, respect for human rights, appreciation for national heroes, 
the rights and duties of citizenship, and moral and spiritual values... 
as part of the curricula. Expelling or banning the petitioners from 
Philippine schools will bring about the very situation that this Court 
had feared in Gerona. Forcing a small religious group, through the iron 
hand of the law, to participate in a ceremony that violates their 
religious beliefs, will hardly be conducive to love of country or 
respect for duly constituted authorities.

In 
Bustamante v. National Labor Relations Commission
,
[26]
 this Court reconsidered its continued application of the 1974 case of 
Mercury Drug Co., Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations
[27]

 on the extent of an illegally dismissed employee's entitlement to 
backwages, because of the passage of a 1989 amendment to the Labor Code 
of the Philippines. Thus:


In sum, during the effectivity of P.D. 442, the Court 
enforced the Mercury Drug rule and, in effect, qualified the provision 
under P.D. No. 442 by limiting the award of backwages to three (3) 
years.





On 21 March 1989, Republic Act No. 6715 took effect, amending the Labor Code. Article 279 thereof states in part:


"ART. 279. Security of Tenure. - ... An employee who is 
unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without 
loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages,
 inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary 
equivalent computed from the time his compensation is withheld from him 
up to the time of his actual reinstatement."


In accordance with the above provision, an illegally dismissed employee 
is entitled to his full backwages from the time his compensation was 
withheld from him (which as a rule is from the time of his illegal 
dismissal) up to the time of his actual reinstatement. It is true that 
this Court had ruled in the case of Pines City Educational Center vs. 
NLRC... that "in ascertaining the total amount of backwages payable to 
them (employees), we go back to the rule prior to the Mercury Drug rule 
that the total amount derived from employment elsewhere by the employee 
from the date of dismissal up to the date of reinstatement, if any, 
should be deducted therefrom." The rationale for such ruling was that, 
the earnings derived elsewhere by the dismissed employee while 
litigating the legality of his dismissal, should be deducted from the 
full amount of backwages which the law grants him upon reinstatement, so
 as not to unduly or unjustly enrich the employee at the expense of the 
employer.




The Court deems it appropriate, however, to reconsider such earlier 
ruling on the computation of backwages as enunciated in said Pines City 
Educational Center case, by now holding that conformably with the 
evident legislative intent as expressed in Rep. Act No. 6715, 
above-quoted, backwages to be awarded to an illegally dismissed 
employee, should not, as a general rule, be diminished or reduced by the
 earnings derived by him elsewhere during the period of his illegal 
dismissal. The underlying reason for this ruling is that the employee, 
while litigating the legality (illegality) of his dismissal, must still 
earn a living to support himself and family, while full backwages have 
to be paid by the employer as part of the price or penalty he has to pay
 for illegally dismissing his employee. The clear legislative intent of 
the amendment in Rep. Act No. 6715 is to give more benefits to workers 
than was previously given them under the Mercury Drug rule or the 
"deduction of earnings elsewhere" rule. Thus, a closer adherence to the 
legislative policy behind Rep. Act No. 6715 points to "full backwages" 
as meaning exactly that, i.e., without deducting from backwages the 
earnings derived elsewhere by the concerned employee during the period 
of his illegal dismissal. In other words, the provision calling for 
"full backwages" to illegally dismissed employees is clear, plain and 
free from ambiguity and, therefore, must be applied without attempted or
 strained interpretation. 
Index animi sermo est.


Therefore, in accordance with R.A. No. 6715, petitioners are entitled to
 their full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits or 
their monetary equivalent, from the time their actual compensation was 
withheld from them up to the time of their actual reinstatement.

In 
Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals (Sixth Division)
,
[29]

 the textual strengthening of the Constitutional principle that public 
office is a public trust underpinned this Court's abandonment of the 
condonation doctrine developed in 
Pascual v. Hon. Provincial Board of Nueva Ecija
[30]
, 
Aguinaldo v. Santos
,
[31]

 and other cases. A stronger legal norm towards the accountability of 
public offers made untenable the notion that elections may bestow 
absolution for administrative offenses:


Reading the 1987 Constitution together with the above-cited 
legal provisions now leads this Court to the conclusion that the 
doctrine of condonation is actually bereft of legal bases.


To begin with, the concept of public office is a public trust and the 
corollary requirement of accountability to the people at all times, as 
mandated under the 1987 Constitution, is plainly inconsistent with the 
idea that an elective local official's administrative liability for a 
misconduct committed during a prior term can be wiped off by the fact 
that he was elected to a second term of office, or even another elective
 post. Election is not a mode of condoning an administrative offense, 
and there is simply no constitutional or statutory basis in our 
jurisdiction to support the notion that an official elected for a 
different term is fully absolved of any administrative liability arising
 from an offense done during a prior term. In this jurisdiction, 
liability arising from administrative offenses may be condoned by the 
President in light of Section 19, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution 
which was interpreted in Llamas v. Orbos to apply to administrative 
offenses[.]

In reexamining its own doctrines, this Court must actively and 
judiciously thread the needle between predictable application of 
established rules, and rejection of those same rules when justice 
requires. We must base the abandonment of any established doctrine on a 
nuanced and expansive review of why that doctrine existed in the first 
place, and now, why our continuing reliance on it is fundamentally 
untenable.

For a trade or service mark to be registered and its owner entitled to 
all rights and protections granted under the Intellectual Property Code,
 it must undergo the processes of examination and publication outlined 
in the law:


Under the Intellectual Property Code, marks applied for 
registration must undergo examination and publication, and the 
application may be opposed by any person who believes that they may be 
damaged by the registration. Examination, publication, and opposition 
are integral to the registration process. By having all marks undergoing
 all these steps, the Philippine Intellectual Property Office ensures 
the integrity of the Philippine Trademark Database along with the 
validity of all registered marks in it, protecting the rights of 
existing trade and service mark registrants, as well as other relevant 
stakeholders.
[33]
 (Citations omitted)



Once the application for a mark has been published, it may be opposed by
 any person on the basis that they would be damaged by its registration:


SECTION 134. 
Opposition
. - 
Any person who believes that he would be damaged by the registration of a mark

 may, upon payment of the required fee and within thirty (30) days after
 the publication referred to in Subsection 133.2, file with the Office 
an opposition to the application. Such opposition shall be in writing 
and verified by the oppositor or by any person on his behalf who knows 
the facts, and shall specify the grounds on which it is based and 
include a statement of the facts relied upon. Copies of certificates of 
registration of marks registered in other countries or other supporting 
documents mentioned in the opposition shall be filed therewith, together
 with the translation in English, if not in the English language. For 
good cause shown and upon payment of the required surcharge, the time 
for filing an opposition may be extended by the Director of Legal 
Affairs, who shall notify the applicant of such extension. The 
Regulations shall fix the maximum period of time within which to file 
the opposition. (Emphasis supplied)




"Any person" had been construed by this Court to include a prior and continuous user of the mark who is deemed its true owner,
[34]

 though this Court has recently held that the rule of ownership of a 
mark based on prior use is incompatible with the Intellectual Property 
Code.
[35]



However, should a mark be registered without opposition, any person who 
believes that they have been or will be damaged by its registration may 
still file a petition to cancel its registration, under the Intellectual
 Property Code:


SECTION 151. 
Cancellation
. - 151.1. A petition to 
cancel a registration of a mark under this Act may be filed with the 
Bureau of Legal Affairs by any person who believes that he is or will be
 damaged by the registration of a mark under this Act as follows:


(a) Within five (5) years from the date of the registration of the mark under this Act.


(b) At any time, if the registered mark becomes the generic name for the
 goods or services, or a portion thereof, for which it is registered, or
 has been abandoned, or its registration was obtained fraudulently or 
contrary to the provisions of this Act, or if the registered mark is 
being used by, or with the permission of, the registrant so as to 
misrepresent the source of the goods or services on or in connection 
with which the mark is used. If the registered mark becomes the generic 
name for less than all of the goods and services for which it is 
registered, a petition to cancel the registration for only those goods 
or services may be filed. A registered mark shall not be deemed to be 
the generic name of goods or services solely because such mark is also 
used as a name of or to identify a unique product or service. The 
primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public 
rather than purchaser motivation shall be the test for determining 
whether the registered mark has become the generic name of goods or 
services on or in connection with which it has been used.


(c) At any time, if the registered owner of the mark without legitimate 
reason fails to use the mark within the Philippines, or cause it to be 
used in the Philippines by virtue of a license during an uninterrupted 
period of three (3) years or longer.




151.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the court of the 
administrative agency vested with jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate 
any action to enforce the rights to a registered mark shall likewise 
exercise jurisdiction to determine whether the registration of said mark
 may be cancelled in accordance with this Act. The filing of a suit to 
enforce the registered mark with the proper court or agency shall 
exclude any other court or agency from assuming jurisdiction over a 
subsequently filed petition to cancel the same mark. On the other hand, 
the earlier filing of petition to cancel the mark with the Bureau of 
Legal Affairs shall not constitute a prejudicial question that must be 
resolved before an action to enforce the rights to same registered mark 
may be decided.



The remedies of opposition to a trade or service mark application and 
cancellation of a registration are distinct from the remedies of 
infringement,
[36]
 unfair competition,
[37]
 and false designations of origin and false description or representation.
[38]
 All the same, the remedy of cancellation of registration is available in any action involving a registered mark.
[39]



Generally, the owner of a registered mark has the exclusive right to 
prevent unauthorized third parties from using "identical or similar 
signs" to their registered mark in "the course of trade," when the use 
would result in a likelihood of confusion:


SECTION 147. 
Rights Conferred
. - 147.1. Except in 
cases of importation of drugs and medicines allowed under Section 72.1 
of this Act and of off-patent drugs and medicines, the owner of a 
registered mark shall have the exclusive right to prevent all third 
parties not having the owner's consent from using in the course of trade
 identical or similar signs to those in respect of which the trademark 
is registered where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. 
In case of the use of an identical sign for identical goods or services,
 a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed.




There shall be no infringement of trademarks or tradenames of imported 
or sold patented drugs and medicines allowed under Section 72.1 of this 
Act, as well as imported or sold off-patent drugs and medicines; 
Provided
,
 That, said drugs and medicines bear the registered marks that have not 
been tampered, unlawfully modified, or infringed upon, under Section 155
 of this Code.



Taking together Sections 134 and 147 of the Intellectual Property Code, 
the owner of a registered mark, if they should so choose, may oppose 
another's application for trade or service mark registration if they 
believe that they will be damaged by the other's registration. Further, 
Section 151 allows the owner to petition for the cancellation of the 
other mark's registration on a similar basis. This is founded on the 
owner's exclusive right in Section 147, which means the owner must show 
that: first, the third party (in this instance, the applicant or other 
registrant) is using an identical or similar sign as the registered 
mark; second, the use is in the course of trade; and third, the use 
would result in a likelihood of confusion. A presumption of likelihood 
of confusion arises when an identical sign is used for identical goods 
or services, which the applicant or other registrant must then rebut.



Although intertwined and often inseparable, the two distinct concepts of
 a mark as defined in Section 121.1 of the Intellectual Property Code
[40]
 are (1) a "visible sign"
[41]

 by itself and (2) its capability to distinguish an enterprise's goods 
or services. If the distinctions between the two concepts were 
irrelevant, then the Intellectual Property Code in Section 147 would not
 have needed to stipulate that both the sign, and the goods or services 
for which the sign is used must be identical for a presumption of 
likelihood of confusion to arise. Likewise, the registrability of a mark
 can depend, alternately, on whether it is "identical with", or 
"identical with, or confusingly similar to" another mark.
[42]



Whether the issue concerns marks as visible signs by themselves, or 
their capability to distinguish an enterprise's goods or services, in 
trade or service mark applications, registrations, or infringement, one 
common element is likelihood of confusion.
[43]



Should the two visible signs at issue be absolutely identical in every 
way, the case's resolution may depend on another factor, such as the 
determination of the true owner of the mark.
[44]
 However, once there are visible differences between the marks, the question then turns to the degree of similarity:


Next, before we consider the resemblances between these two 
marks, we should have before us some of the applicable principles which 
go to make up the law of trade-marks and unfair competition. Similarity,
 as we have said, is the test of infringement of a trade-mark. Moreover,
 this is not such similitude as amounts to identity. Exact copies could 
hardly be expected to be found. If the form, marks, contents, words, or 
other special arrangement or general appearance of the words of the 
alleged infringer's device, are such as would be likely to mislead 
persons in the ordinary course of purchasing the genuine article, then 
the similarity is such as entitles the injured party to equitable 
protection, if he takes seasonable measures to assert his rights and 
prevent their continued invasion. The deceptive tendency indicated by 
copying or imitating the substantial and distinctive part of the 
trade-mark, so as to pass off the goods of one man as those of another, 
is sufficient to show infringement. In all cases the court will inspect 
the trade-marks to discover both the differences and the resemblances. 
Relief will ordinarily be granted when it is manifest from a comparison 
of the two trade-marks or articles that one was copied from the other.



....



To quote the language of Lurton, J., "When there are found strong 
resemblances, the natural inquiry for the court is, why do they exist? 
If no sufficient answer appears, the inference is that they exist for 
the purpose of misleading[.]"
[45]
 (Citations omitted)



To determine the degree of similarity necessary for a finding of 
infringement, or entitlement to a denial of application or cancellation 
of registration, of a mark, jurisprudence has historically evaluated 
them in one of two ways.



As early as 1954, the test of dominancy has been used to determine whether a mark is confusingly similar to another. In 
Co Tiong Sa v. Director of Patents
:
[46]


The first four assignments of error are related to each 
other and may be considered together. There is no question that if the 
details of the two trademarks are to be considered, many differences 
would be noted that would enable a careful and scrutinizing eye to 
distinguish one trademark from the other. Thus, we have the vignette of a
 man wearing a tophat, which would distinguish the oppositor's label 
from the triangle with the letter on the right hand corner of 
applicant's label. Then we also have the rectangle enclosing the 
applicant's mark, which rectangle is absent in that of the oppositor's. 
But differences of variations in the details of one trademark and of 
another are not the legally accepted tests of similarity in trademarks. 
It
 has been consistently held that the question of infringement of a 
trademark is to be determined by the test of dominancy. Similarity in 
size, form, and color, while relevant, is not conclusive. If the 
competing trademark contains the main or essential or dominant features 
of another, and confusion and deception is likely to result, 
infringement takes place. Duplication or imitation is not necessary; nor
 is it necessary that the infringing label should suggest an effort to 
imitate
.... The question at issue in cases of infringement of 
trademarks is whether the use of the marks involved would be likely to 
cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive 
purchasers[.]




When would a trademark cause confusion in the mind of the public or in 
those unwary customers or purchasers? It must be remembered that 
infringement of a trademark is a form of unfair competition... and 
unfair competition is always a question of fact. The universal test has 
been said to be whether the public is likely to be deceived[.]


When a person sees an object, a central or dominant idea or picture 
thereof is formed in his mind. This dominant picture or idea is retained
 in the mind, and the decorations or details are forgotten. When one 
sees the city hall of Baguio, the dominant characteristics which are 
likely to be retained in the mind are the portico in the middle of the 
building, the tower thereon, the four columns supporting it, and the 
wings on both sides. The features that are retained are the peculiar, 
dominant features. When one sees the Legislative Building in Manila, the
 picture that is retained is that of a majestic low building with 
concrete columns all around. In this mindÂ­picture the slight or minor 
decorations are lost sight of, and the central figure only is retained. 
So is it with a customer or purchaser who sees a label. He retains in 
his mind the dominant characteristics or features or central idea in the
 label, and does not retain or forgets the attendant decorations, 
flourishes, or variations. The ordinary customer does not scrutinize the
 details of the label; he forgets or overlooks these, but retains a 
general impression, or a central figure, or a dominant characteristic[.]

When the Intellectual Property Code took effect in 1998, Section 155
[54]
 codified the dominancy test.
[55]
 In 
ABS-CBN Publishing, Inc. v. The Director of the Bureau of Trademarks
:
[56]


To determine whether a mark is to be considered as 
"identical" or that which is confusingly similar with that of another, 
the Court has developed two (2) tests: the dominancy and holistic tests.
 While the Court has time and again ruled that the application of the 
tests is on a case to case basis, upon the passage of the IPC, the trend
 has been to veer away from the usage of the holistic test and to focus 
more on the usage of the dominancy test. As stated by the Court in the 
case of 
McDonald's Corporation vs. L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.
, the
 "test of dominancy is now explicitly incorporated into law in Section 
155.1 of the Intellectual Property Code which defines infringement as 
the 'colorable imitation of a registered mark x x x or a dominant 
feature thereof.'" This is rightly so because Sec. 155.1 provides that:


SECTION 155. Remedies; Infringement. - Any person who shall, without the consent of the owner of the registered mark:


155.1. Use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable
 imitation of a registered mark or the same container or a dominant 
feature thereof in connection with the sale, offering for sale, 
distribution, advertising of any goods or services including other 
preparatory steps necessary to carry out the sale of any goods or 
services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause 
confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive; or x x x.


In using this test, focus is to be given to the dominant features of the marks in question. In the 1954 case of 
Co Tiong Sa vs. Director of Patents
, the Court, in using the dominancy test, taught that:


But differences of variations in the details of one trademark and of 
another are not the legally accepted tests of similarity in trademarks. 
It has been consistently held that the question of infringement of a 
trademark is to be determined by the test of dominancy. Similarity in 
size, form, and color, while relevant, is not conclusive. If the 
competing trademark contains the main or essential or dominant features 
of another, and confusion and deception is likely to result, 
infringement takes place.



The Court, in 
Skechers, U.S.A., Inc. vs. Inter Pacific Industrial Trading Corp.
, and in once again using the dominancy test, reiterated 
Del Monte Corporation vs. Court of Appeals

 in saying that "the defendants in cases of infringement do not normally
 copy but only make colorable changes." The Court emphasized that "the 
most successful form of copying is to employ enough points of similarity
 to confuse the public, with enough points of difference to confuse the 
courts."
[57]
 (Citations omitted)



Yet, decades before the Intellectual Property Code gave imprimatur to 
the dominancy test, this Court had already set in place another test to 
determine trademark similarity.



In the 1963 case of 
Mead Johnson & Company v. N.V.J. Van Dorp, Ltd.
,
[58]

 this Court was called upon to determine if the application for the 
trademark "ALASKA and pictorial representation of a Boy's Head within a 
rectangular design (ALASKA disclaimed)"
[59]

 should be denied due to a previously-registered and allegedly-similar 
"ALACTA" mark. There, this Court found that the appearances of the 
"ALASKA" and "ALACTA" marks were dissimilar as to allow "ALASKA"'s 
registration, because it examined not only the "predominant words" but 
also the "other features" in both marks:
[60]


On the other hand, respondent contends that it is not 
correct to say that in passing on the question as to whether the two 
marks are similar only the words "ALASKA" and "ALACTA" should be taken 
into account since this would be a most arbitrary way of ascertaining 
whether similarity exists between two marks. Rather, respondent 
contends, the two marks in their entirety and the goods they cover 
should be considered and carefully compared to determine whether 
petitioner's opposition to the registration is capricious or well-taken.
 In this connection, respondent invokes the following rules of 
interpretation: (1) appellant's mark is to be compared with all of the 
oppositor's marks in determining the point of confusion; (2) the 
likelihood of confusion may be determined by a comparison of the marks 
involved and a consideration of the goods to which they are attached; 
and (3) the court will view the marks with respect to the goods to which
 they are applied, and from its own observation arrive at a conclusion 
as to the likelihood of confusion.




It is true that between petitioner's trademark "ALACTA" and respondent's
 "ALASKA" there are similarities in spelling, appearance and sound for 
both are composed of six letters of three syllables each and each 
syllable has the same vowel, but in determining if they are confusingly 
similar a comparison of said words is not the only determining factor. 
The two marks in their entirety as they appear in the respective labels 
must also be considered in relation to the goods to which they are 
attached. The discerning eye of the observer must focus not only on the 
predominant words but also on the other features appearing in both 
labels in order that he may draw his conclusion whether one is 
confusingly similar to the other. Having this view in mind, we believe 
that while there are similarities in the two marks there are also 
differences or dissimilarities which are glaring and striking to the eye
 as the former. Thus we find the following dissimilarities in the two 
marks:


(a) The sizes of the containers of the goods of petitioner differ from 
those of respondent. The goods of petitioner come in one-pound container
 while those of respondent come in three sizes, to wit: 14-ounce tin of 
full condensed full cream milk; 14 1/2-ounce tin of evaporated milk; and
 6- ounce tin of evaporated milk.


(b) The colors too differ. One of petitioner's containers has one single
 background color, to wit: light blue; the other has two background 
colors, pink and white. The containers of respondent's goods have two 
color bands, yellowish white and red.


(c) Petitioner's mark "ALACTA" has only the first letter capitalized and
 is written in black. Respondent's mark "ALASKA" has all the letters 
capitalized written in white except that of the condensed full cream 
milk which is in red.

This Court has criticized the holistic test for being contrary to the ethos of the law of trademarks and unfair competition. In 
Societe Des Produits Nestle, S.A. v. Court of Appeals
:
[76]


Moreover, the totality or holistic test is contrary to the 
elementary postulate of the law on trademarks and unfair competition 
that confusing similarity is to be determined on the basis of visual, 
aural, connotative comparisons and overall impressions engendered by the
 marks in controversy as they are encountered in the realities of the 
marketplace. The totality or holistic test only relies on visual 
comparison between two trademarks whereas the dominancy test relies not 
only on the visual but also on the aural and connotative comparisons and
 overall impressions between the two trademarks.
[77]
 (Citation omitted)



This criticism has been echoed more recently, in 
Somboonsakdikul v. Orlane S.A.
:
[78]


The CA's use of the dominancy test is in accord with our more recent ruling in 
UFC Philppines, Inc. (now merged with Nutria-Asia, Inc. as the surviving entity) v. Barrio Fiesta Manufacturing Corporation
. In 
UFC Philippines, Inc.
, we relied on our declarations in 
McDonald's
 Corporation v. L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc., Co Tiong Sa v. Director of 
Patents, and Societe Des Produits Nestle, S.A. v. Court of Appeals
 
that the dominancy test is more in line with the basic rule in 
trademarks that confusing similarity is determined by the aural, visual 
and connotative and overall impressions created by the marks. Thus, 
based on the dominancy test, we ruled that there is no confusing 
similarity between "PAPA BOY & DEVICE" mark, and "PAPA KETSARAP" and
 "PAPA BANANA CATSUP."
[79]
 (Citations omitted)



Yet, despite all these pronouncements, this Court did not explicitly abandon the holistic test. Although 
McDonald's Corp. v. L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.
[80]
 stated that 
Societe Des Produits Nestle, S.A.
 was an explicit rejection of the holistic test, 
Societe Des Produits Nestle, S.A.
 was not an 
en banc
 case that could have reversed the existing doctrines established in 
Mead Johnson & Company
, and its succeeding cases. An "overwhelming judicial preference"
[81]

 for the dominancy test was not an abandonment of the holistic test. 
Instead, this Court continued to permit the Intellectual Property Office
 and courts to decide for themselves, sans any meaningful criteria, if 
they should apply the dominancy test or the holistic test in each case 
before them, then use the other test altogether when the case reaches 
this Court. This Court's sole guidance was that "in trademark cases, 
jurisprudential precedents should be applied only to a case if they are 
specifically in point[,]"
[82]
 which is abhorrent to ensuring adjudicatory consistency.



This manner of adjudication often led to essentially 
pro hac vice

 rulings, with selective and unpredictable applications of 
often-incompatible doctrines, without coherent and consistent precedents
 to guide the bench and bar.
[83]
 As admitted by this Court in 
Emerald Garment Manufacturing Corp.
:
[84]


Practical application, however, of the aforesaid provision 
is easier said than done. In the history of trademark cases in the 
Philippines, particularly in ascertaining whether one trademark is 
confusingly similar to or is a colorable imitation of another, 
no set rules can be deduced. Each case must be decided on its own merits
.
[85]
 (Emphasis supplied)




Moreover, despite this Court stating that the dominancy and holistic 
tests are two different tests, the instances when an application of both
 leads to the same conclusion made the choice between the two seemingly 
ineffectual.


Taiwan Kolin
[86]
 used the holistic test, if not by name then by its method of examining the marks in the case:


While both competing marks refer to the word "KOLIN" written
 in upper case letters and in bold font, the Court at once notes the 
distinct visual and aural differences between them: Kolin Electronics' 
mark is italicized and colored black while that of Taiwan Kolin is white
 in pantone red color background. The differing features between the 
two, though they may appear minimal, are sufficient to distinguish one 
brand from the other.
[87]



Based on the existing standards in our cases, this Court in 
Taiwan Kolin

 was not incorrect in using the holistic test and arriving at the 
conclusion it reached. As the case itself observed, this Court had in 
the past tolerated the co-existence of trademark registrations by two 
unrelated entities of identical marks.
[88]



Contrary to the conclusion reached in the ponencia, 
Taiwan Kolin
's use of the holistic test was not "improper precedent[,]"
[89]

 notwithstanding Section 155 of the Intellectual Property Code. At the 
time it was decided, our caselaw on the holistic test was good law. 
Taiwan Kolin
 was not some stray case
[90]

 or an aberration in our jurisprudence. Neither did it lay down some 
novel principle of law that modified or reversed prior doctrines, 
because under our Constitution, only this Court 
en banc
[91]
 has that power.
[92]
 Instead, 
Taiwan Kolin

 was a successor, taken to its logical extremes, to an extant line of 
trademark cases that had not been expressly abandoned. Even 
Kensonic, Inc. v. Uni-Line Multi-Resources, Inc., (Phil.)
,
[93]
 the sole case that cites 
Taiwan Kolin
 prior to the present case, recognized that 
Taiwan Kolin
 is in keeping with 
Mighty Corp. v. E. & J. Gallo Winery
:
[94]


Uni-Line posits that its goods under Class 9 were unrelated 
to the goods of Kensonic; and that the CA's holding of the goods being 
related by virtue of their belonging to the same class was unacceptable.




In 
Taiwan Kolin Corporation, Ltd v. Kolin Electronics, Co., Inc.
,
 the Court has opined that the mere fact that goods belonged to the same
 class does not necessarily mean that they are related; and that the 
factors listed in 
Mighty Corporation v. E. & J. Gallo Winery
 should be taken into consideration, to wit:


As mentioned, the classification of the products under the 
NCL is merely part and parcel of the factors to be considered in 
ascertaining whether the goods are related. It is not sufficient to 
state that the goods involved herein are electronic products under Class
 9 in order to establish relatedness between the goods, for this only 
accounts for one of many considerations enumerated in Mighty 
Corporation. x x x



Clearly then, it was erroneous for respondent to assume over the CA to 
conclude that all electronic products are related and that the coverage 
of one electronic product necessarily precludes the registration of a 
similar mark over another. In this digital age wherein electronic 
products have not only diversified by leaps and bounds, and are geared 
towards interoperability, it is difficult to assert readily, as 
respondent simplistically did, that all devices that require plugging 
into sockets are necessarily related goods.



It bears to stress at this point that the list of products included in 
Class 9 can be sub-categorized into five (5) classifications, namely: 
(1) apparatus and instruments for scientific or research purposes, (2) 
information technology and audiovisual equipment, (3) apparatus and 
devices for controlling the distribution and use of electricity, (4) 
optical apparatus and instruments, and (5) safety equipment. From this 
sub-classification, it becomes apparent that petitioner's products, 
i.e., televisions and DVD players, belong to audiovisual equipment, 
while that of respondent, consisting of automatic voltage regulator, 
converter, recharger stereo booster, AC-DC regulated power supply, 
step-down transformer, and PA amplified AC-DC, generally fall under 
devices for controlling the distribution and use of electricity.


Based on the foregoing pronouncement in 
Taiwan Kolin Corporation, Ltd. v. Kolin Electronics, Co., Inc.
,
 there are other subÂ­classifications present even if the goods are 
classified under Class 09. For one, Kensonic's goods belonged to the 
information technology and audiovisual equipment sub-class, but 
Uni-Line's goods pertained to the apparatus and devices for controlling 
the distribution of electricity subÂ­class. Also, the Class 09 goods of 
Kensonic were final products but UniÂ­Line's Class 09 products were spare
 parts. In view of these distinctions, the Court agrees with Uni-Line 
that its Class 09 goods were umelated to the Class 09 goods of Kensonic.
[95]



While the 
ponencia
 has laudably sought to bring jurisprudential 
stability through the unequivocal abandonment of the holistic test, I 
urge this Court to also seriously refine the existing standards for 
determining the likelihood of confusion of goods and business.
[96]
 Admittedly, likelihood of confusion is highly fact-specific based on the circumstances of each case.
[97]

 Yet, considering the advances in the fields of competition and 
economics, this Court should improve the standards by which likelihood 
of confusion is measured.
[98]



Evaluations of likelihood of confusion cannot be left to the subjective 
determination by the Intellectual Property Office or the courts, which 
may often rely on 
ad hoc
 inferences of similarity in class, 
physical attributes or descriptive properties, purpose, or points of 
sale of the goods or services.
[99]
 Often, this Court has resorted to unsubstantiated assumptions and generalizations about consumers and their behavior,
[100]
 arbitrary categorizations of goods and services,
[101]
 and even outright derogatory classist stereotypes.
[102]
 In this case, the 
ponencia

 describes a distinction between "sophisticated" and "ordinary" buyers 
without any real basis for the respective consumption and commercial 
habits assigned to each sector, resulting in broad caricatures about 
both the goods covered by the marks and their markets.
[103]



Relativity in likelihood of confusion must g1ve way to objective, scientific, and economic standards:


There should be objective, scientific, and economic 
standards to determine whether goods or services offered by two parties 
are so related that there is a likelihood of confusion. In a market, the
 relatedness of goods or services may be determined by consumer 
preferences. When two goods are proved to be perfect substitutes, where 
the marginal rate of substitution, or the "consumer's willingness to 
substitute one good for another while maintaining the same level of 
satisfaction" is constant, then it may be concluded that the goods are 
related for the purposes of determining likelihood of confusion. Even 
goods or services, which superficially appear unrelated, may be proved 
related if evidence is presented showing that these have significant 
cross-elasticity of demand, such that changes of price in one party's 
goods or services change the price of the other party's goods and 
services. Should it be proved that goods or services belong to the same 
relevant market, they may be found related even if their classes, 
physical attributes, or purposes are different.
[104]
 (Citations omitted)



This Court should build on past jurisprudence that squarely confront claims of economic or market losses, such as 
Shell Company of the Philippines, Ltd. v. Insular Petroleum Refining Co., Ltd.
:
[105]


It was found by the Court of Appeals that in all 
transactions of the low-grade Insoil, except the present one, all the 
marks and brands on the containers used were erased or obliterated. The 
drum in question did not reach the buying public. It was merely a Shell 
dealer or an operator of a Shell Station who purchased the drum not to 
be resold to the public, but to be sold to the petitioner company, with a
 view of obtaining evidence against someone who might have been 
committing unfair business practices, for the dealer had found that his 
income was dwindling in his gasoline station. Uichangco, the Shell 
dealer, testified that Lozano (respondent's agent) did not at all make 
any representation that he (Lozano) was selling any oil other than 
Insoil motor oil, a fact which finds corroboration in the receipt issued
 for the sale of the drum. Uichangco was apprised beforehand that Lozano
 would sell Insoil oil in a Shell drum. There was no evidence that 
defendants or its agents attempted to persuade Uichangco or any Shell 
dealer, for that matter, to purchase its low-grade oil and to pass the 
same to the public as Shell oil. It was shown that Shell and other oil 
companies, deliver oil to oil dealers or gasoline stations in drums, 
these dealers transfer the contents of
the drums to retailing dispensers known as "tall boys," from which the 
oil is retailed to the public by liters.


This Court is not unaware of the decisions cited by petitioner to 
bolster its contention. We find those cases, however, not applicable to 
the one at bar. Those cases were predicated on facts and circumstances 
different from those of the present. In one case, the trade name of 
plaintiff was stamped on the goods of defendant and they were being 
passed as those of the plaintiff. This circumstance does not obtain 
here. From these cases, one feature common to all comes out in bold 
relief and that is, the competing product involving the offending 
bottles, wrappers, packages or marks reached the hands of the ultimate 
consumer, so bottled, wrapped, packaged or marked. In other words, it is
 the form in which the wares or products come to the ultimate consumer 
that was significant; for, as has been well said, the law of unfair 
competition does not protect purchasers against falsehood which the 
tradesmen may tell; the falsehood must be told by the article itself in 
order to make the law of unfair competition applicable.




Petitioner contends that there had been a marked decrease in the volume 
of sales of low-grade oil of the company, for which reason it argues 
that the sale of respondent's low-grade oil in Shell containers was the 
cause. We are reluctant to share the logic of the argument. We are more 
inclined to believe that several factors contributed to the decrease of 
such sales. But let us assume, for purposes of argument, that the 
presence of respondent's low-grade oil in the market contributed to such
 decrease. May such eventuality make respondent liable for unfair 
competition? There is no prohibition for respondent to sell its goods, 
even in places where the goods of petitioner had long been sold or 
extensively advertised. Respondent should not be blamed if some of 
petitioner's dealers buy Insoil oil, as long as respondent does not 
deceive said dealers. If petitioner's dealers pass off Insoil oil as 
Shell oil, that is their responsibility. If there was any such effort to
 deceive the public, the dealers to whom the defendant (respondent) sold
 its products and not the latter, were legally responsible for such 
deception. The passing of said oil, therefore, as product of Shell was 
not performed by the respondent or its agent, but petitioner's dealers, 
which act respondent had no control whatsoever. And this could easily be
 done, for, as respondents' counsel put it -


"The point we would like to drive home is that if a Shell 
dealer wants to fool the public by passing off INSOIL as SHELL oil he 
could do this by the simple expedient of placing the INSOIL oil or any 
other oil for that matter in the 'tall boys' and dispense it to the 
public as SHELL oil. Whatever container INSOIL uses would be of no 
moment ... absence of a clear showing that INSOIL and the SHELL dealer 
connived or conspired, we respectfully maintain that the responsibility 
of INSOIL ceases from the moment its oil, if ever it has ever been done,
 is transferred by a shell dealer to a SHELL 'tall boy!
'"

Rule 18, Section 5 of A.M. No. 10-3-10-SC, or the 2020 Revised Rules of 
Procedure for Intellectual Property Rights Cases, enumerates several 
factors to be considered as evidence of likelihood of confusion in 
trademark and unfair competition cases:


SECTION 5. 
Likelihood of confusion in other cases
. - 
In determining whether one trademark is confusingly similar to or is a 
colorable imitation of another, the court must consider the general 
impression of the ordinary purchaser, buying under the normally 
prevalent conditions in trade, and giving the attention such purchasers 
usually give in buying that class of goods. Visual, aural, connotative 
comparisons and overall impressions engendered by the marks in 
controversy as they are encountered in the realities of the marketplace 
must be taken into account. Where there are both similarities and 
differences in the marks, these must be weighed against one another to 
determine which predominates.


In determining likelihood of confusion between marks used on 
nonÂ­identical goods or services, several factors may be taken into 
account, such as, but not limited to:


a) the strength of plaintiffs mark;


b) the degree of similarity between the plaintiffs and the defendant's marks;


c) the proximity of the products or services;


d) the likelihood that the plaintiff will bridge the gap;


e) evidence of actual confusion;



f) the defendant's good faith in adopting the mark;

g) the quality of defendant's product or service; and/or



 

h) the sophistication of the buyer


"Colorable imitation" denotes such a close or ingenious imitation as to 
be calculated to deceive ordinary persons, or such a resemblance to the 
original as to deceive an ordinary purchaser giving such attention as a 
purchaser usually gives, as to cause him or her to purchase the one 
supposing it to be the other.


Absolute certainty of confusion or even actual confusion is not required
 to accord protection to trademarks already registered with the IPO.



Among other pieces of evidence, these factors must be proven by 
testimonies of witnesses stringently qualified to show their knowledge, 
skill, experience, or training on the subject matter of their testimony;
[107]

 or by the presentation of scientific surveys, conducted with the 
appropriate methodology and with the proper sampling and scope, of the 
relevant market or trade conditions, as stated in Rule 18, Section 9 of 
the 2020 Revised Rules of Procedure for Intellectual Property Rights 
Cases:


SECTION 9. 
Market Survey
. - A market survey is a 
scientific market or consumer survey which a party may offer in evidence
 to prove (a) the primary significance of a mark to the relevant public,
 including its distinctiveness, its descriptive or generic status, its 
strength or well-known status and/or (b) likelihood of confusion.



Admittedly, market-based evidence on likelihood of confusion may be more
 difficult to obtain if one of the marks is still undergoing the 
registration process and has not yet actually been introduced to the 
public. However, Section 147 of the Intellectual Property Code may guide
 oppositors who assert their ownership of registered marks. If the mark 
applied for is found identical to the registered mark and the use is for
 identical goods or services, the oppositor has in their favor a 
presumption of likelihood of confusion. The applicant then bears the 
burden of overcoming the presumption by sufficient evidence.



In other instances-such as similar signs for similar goods or services; 
identical signs for similar goods or services; or similar signs for 
identical goods or services-the likelihood of confusion must be proved 
with evidence by owner of the registered mark. One such instance is the 
present case, where the Bureau of Legal Affairs evaluated e-mails from 
Kolin Electronics Co. Inc.'s customers asking about Kolin Philippines 
International, Inc.'s goods, implying confusion of origin or their 
respective items for sale.
[108]
 As for "any person"
[109]

 not an owner of a registered mark, the damage must be proven in other 
ways-what that contemplates is outside the scope of this case.


III



As a final note, overreliance on rules and findings of foreign 
jurisdictions to resolve domestic intellectual property disputes should 
be discouraged. If this Court adopts or applies a foreign agency's 
findings on matters of trademark registration on behalf of the 
Philippine Intellectual Property Office, it would unduly encroach upon 
the Office's power to devise its own manual of examination procedure for
 trademarks.
[110]
 Worse, 
Article 8 of the Civil Code and the deference accorded by administrative
 agencies to judicial decisions may lead to this Court imposing its own 
formulation of administrative intellectual property guidelines upon the 
Philippine Intellectual Property Office. There is also a danger that 
swiftly-moving foreign caselaw may leave this Court futilely struggling 
to reconcile overturned cases with later established precedents which 
have histories and developments unfamiliar to this jurisdiction.
[111]



Moreover, the social value placed by our Constitution upon private 
property-including intellectual property-must be taken into 
consideration in ways that foreign rules and rulings perhaps do not. By 
uncritically adopting foreign interpretations of intellectual property 
concepts, without any substantive anchor or reference to our existing 
laws and rules, we may be undermining the very rules and doctrines that 
we pass.



Trade and service marks are not intended to unduly restrict free trade, 
foster monopolistic practices, or unfairly exclude competitors from the 
market.
[112]
 Thus, the 
doctrines and precedents this Court lays down should not be used 
to-consciously or unwittingly-interfere with free and fair competition, 
under the guise of consumer protection and fraud prevention.
[113]





Like all forms of intellectual property, trade and service marks are not
 only objects of private ownership. They also bear a social function 
that shall contribute to a common good.
[114]

 As such, our disposition of intellectual property cases must not merely
 treat them as private commercial constructs, but as legal concepts that
 perform holistic public functions,
[115]
 held to rigorous and exacting standards on which the bench, bar, and the public may safely rely on and trust.

 In 
Lim Hoa v. Director of Patents
,
 100 Phil. 214 (1956) [Per J. Montemayor, En Banc], this Court stated: 
The danger of confusion in trademarks and brands which are similar may 
not be so great in the case of commodities or articles of relatively 
great value, such as, radio and television sets, air conditioning units,
 machinery, etc., for the prospective buyer, generally the head of the 
family or a businessman, before making the purchase, reads the pamphlets
 and all literature available, describing the article he is planning to 
buy, and perhaps even makes comparisons with similar articles in the 
market. He is not likely to be deceived by similarity in the trademarks 
because he makes a more or less thorough study of the same and may even 
consult his friends about the relative merit and performance of the 
article or machinery, as compared to others also for sale. But in the 
sale of a food seasoning product, a kitchen article of everyday 
consumption, the circumstances are far different. Said product is 
generally purchased by cooks and household help, sometimes illiterate 
who are guided by pictorial representations and the sound of the word 
descriptive of said representation. The two roosters appearing in the 
trademark of the applicant and the hen appearing on the trademark of the
 oppositor, although of different sexes, belong to the same family of 
chicken, known as manokin all the principal dialects of the Philippines,
 and when a cook or a household help or even a housewife buys a food 
seasoning product for the kitchen the brand of "Manok" or "Marca Manok" 
would most likely be upper most in her mind and would influence her in 
selecting the product, regardless of whether the brand pictures a hen or
 a rooster or two roosters. To her, they are all 
manok
. Therein lies the confusion, even deception.

SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION
M. LOPEZ, J.:



The present case involves respondent Kolin Philippines International, Inc.'s (KPII) application for registration of the 
kol
i
n
 mark based on Taiwan Kolin Corporation, Ltd.'s (TKC) (KPII's predecessor in interest) ownership over the 
KOLIN
 mark. Petitioner Kolin Electronics Co. Inc. (KECI) opposed KPII's application based on its ownership over the 
KOLIN
 mark.





As discussed in the 
ponencia
, the Court's Third Division (Third Division) ruled that (image supposed to be here) is not confusingly similar to 
KOLIN
 in 
Taiwan Kolin Corporation, Ltd. v. Kolin Electronics Co., Inc. (Taiwan Kolin)
,
[1]
 even if the subject of the trademark (TM) application is the 
KOLIN
 mark. As a result, the 
KOLIN
 mark was allowed registration. The Third Division also ruled that KECI and TKC's goods are not related.



I agree with the 
ponencia
 that the KOLIN marks are visually, 
aurally, and connotatively similar, and the goods that they cover are 
related. Additionally, this case provides the Court with the opportunity
 to correct the misconception and use of the phrases "
same descriptive properties
" and "
same class of merchandise
,"
 which have affected the application of the related goods doctrine, and 
which may have prejudiced the rights of more than one intellectual 
property rights holder. With this, the use of the "
same descriptive properties
" and "
same class of merchandise
" as factors in determining the relatedness of goods must be abandoned.


I.

The doctrine of 
res judicata
 is not applicable in this case.



The 
ponencia
 sufficiently discussed why there is no identity of 
causes of action in this case. KECI's cause of action in the case at bar
 is based on its right as the registered TM owner of 
KOLIN
 to prevent the registration of TM Application No. 4-2006-010021 covering 
kol
i
n
 for use on televisions and DVD players. On the other hand, KECI's cause of action in 
Taiwan Kolin
 is based on its right as the registered TM owner of 
KOLIN
 to prevent the registration of TM Application No. 4-1996-106310 covering 
KOLIN
 for use on televisions and DVD players. Clearly, the first concept of res judicata is not applicable.


As regards the second concept of 
res judicata
, the Court explained conclusiveness of judgment in 
Social Security Commission v. Rizal Poultry and Livestock Association, Inc.
,
[2]
 thus:


But where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the 
first
 judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly 
controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved 
therein. This is the concept of 
res judicata
 known as "conclusiveness of judgment."
 Stated differently, 
any
 right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily 
involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in 
which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the 
judgment therein and cannot again be lit gatd between the parties and 
their privies
, whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same.


Thus, 
if a particular point or question is in issue in the second 
action, and the judgment will depend on the determination of that 
particular point or question, a former judgment between the same parties
 or their privies will be final and conclusive in the second if that 
same point or question was in issue and adjudicated in the first suit
. Identity of cause of action is not required but merely identity of issue.
[3]

(Emphases supplied; citations omitted.)


The issue of actual confusion was raised in 
Taiwan Kolin
, but the
 Third Division disregarded the evidence of confusion presented by KECI 
and decided only on the issue of confusing similarity in resolving the 
issue of ownership of the 
KOLIN
 mark in favor of TKC. There is no resolution or direct adjudication on whether there is actual confusion.



Here, KECI again raised the issue of actual confusion. Considering that the Third Division did not pass upon this issue in 
Taiwan Kolin
, I believe conclusiveness of judgment is not applicable. For this reason, 
Taiwan Kolin

 may not bar the Court's determination of actual confusion between the 
KOLIN marks. If there is an evidence of actual confusion in the present 
case which is not available when 
Taiwan Kolin
 was filed, then 
there is more reason for the Court to decide on the issue of actual 
confusion. Otherwise, the Court will be setting a dangerous precedent 
where a registered trademark owner can no longer allege and prove actual
 confusion to oppose the registration of another confusingly similar 
mark or to cancel the registration of a junior trademark user just 
because there has been an initial determination of lack of confusing 
similarity. It bears emphasis that actual confusion is different from 
confusing similarity. In my opinion, a finding of lack of confusing 
similarity cannot preclude the existence of actual confusion later.


II.

The KOLIN marks are visually, aurally, and connotatively identical.



I agree with the 
ponencia
 that KPII's application should not be allowed registration because of KECI's registration of the 
KOLIN
 mark. Also, KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark appropriate the dominant feature of KECI's trade name, 
i.e.
, the word "Kolin."



Section 123.1(d) of the IP Code prohibits the registration of marks which:








(d)


Is identical with a 
registered mark belonging to a different proprietor or a mark with an 
earlier filing or priority date, in respect of:


















(i)


The same goods or services, 
or


















(ii)


 Closely related goods or services, or


















(iii)


If it nearly resembles such a mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion
[.] (Emphases supplied.)






Section 165.2 also considers the use of a party's trade name or business
 name by third parties if such use will likely mislead the public, 
viz
.:


SEC. 165. Trade Names or Business Names. - x x x x


165.2. (a) Notwithstanding any laws or regulations providing for any obligation to register trade names, 
such names shall be protected, even prior to or without registration, against any unlawful act committed by third parties
.


(b) In particular, 
any subsequent use of the trade name by a third party
, whether as a trade name or a mark or collective mark, or any such use of a similar trade name or mark, 
likely to mislead the public, shall be deemed unlawful
. (Emphases supplied.)



To determine likelihood of confusion, Section 4,
[4]
 Rule 18 of the Rules of Procedure for Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Cases provides:


SEC. 4.
 
Likelihood of confusion in other cases
.
 - In determining whether one trademark is confusingly similar to or is a
 colorable imitation of another, the court must consider the general 
impression of the ordinary purchaser, buying under the normally 
prevalent conditions in trade and giving the attention, such purchasers 
usually give in buying that class of goods. 
Visual, aural, connotative comparisons and overall impressions
 engendered by the marks in controversy as they are encountered in the realities of the marketplace must be taken into account. 
Where
 there are both similarities and differences in the marks, these must be
 weighed against one another to see which predominates.


x x x x (Emphasis supplied.)



Applying the foregoing guidelines, a comparison of marks will show that they are visually, aurally, and connotatively identical.


a. 
Visual Comparison
 - This case involves the following KOLIN marks:






KECI's mark 


KOLIN






KPII's marks 


kol
i
n











From the above comparison, one can readily observe the dominant feature of the marks, 
i.e.
,
 the word "Kolin." Replacing the letter "i" with an italicized letter 
"i," does not outweigh the glaring similarities between the marks.



Relevantly, in 
Dermaline, Inc. v. Myra Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
,
[5]

 the Court refused the registration of Dermaline, Inc.'s (image supposed to be here) mark on the ground that it is confusingly similar to Myra 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s registered (image supposed to be here) mark. The Court observed 
that confusing similarity is still apparent even if the marks are 
presented differently since the marks are almost spelled in the same 
way.



Here, the marks are also presented differently, but they are spelled in 
the same way. Hence, there is more reason to rule that the KOLIN marks 
are identical.



Also, KECI's registered 
KOLIN
 mark is a plain word mark. Word 
marks are marks which have no special characteristics, such as design, 
style of lettering, color, diacritical marks, or unusual forms of 
punctuations. They are represented in standard characters.
[6]

 It protects the word itself without limiting the mark to a particular 
font, style, size or color. Standard marks give trademark applicants a 
broader protection.
[7]
 Accordingly, KECI's registration covers all forms and style of the word "Kolin," including KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark.



b. 
Aural Comparison
 - In various cases, the aural effects of the 
marks were considered in determining confusing similarity. The Court 
denied the registration of "LIONPAS" mark because it is confusingly in 
sound with the registered "SALONPAS" mark.
[8]
 In another case, the Court found that "NANNY" and the registered "NAN" mark have the same aural effect.
[9]
 Likewise, the Court found "Big Mac" and "Big Mak" to be phonetically the same.
[10]


In this case, KPII does not claim that 
kol
i
n
 is pronounced differently form KECI's 
KOLIN
 mark. Considering that the KOLIN marks are spelled in the same way, it reasonably follows that they are aurally identical.



c. 
Connotative Comparison
 - The similarity between two marks may 
be caused by a similarity in the concept or meaning of the mark, as 
understood by the ordinary consumer.
[11]



KECI's 
KOLIN
 mark has no standard meaning. As such, it is 
considered as a coined or fanciful mark. A coined or fanciful mark is 
inherently distinctive,
[12]
 
and, therefore, it has a stronger consumer recall. In other words, the 
distinctiveness of a mark measures its capacity to indicate the source 
of the goods or services on which it is used.
[13]



KECI's 
KOLIN
 mark has no standard meaning and an ordinary 
consumer will likely associate it with automatic voltage regulators, 
converters, rechargers, stereo boosters, amplifiers, power supplies, and
 other electrical products. Similarly, KPII's
 kol
i
n

 mark has no standard meaning and an ordinary consumer will likely 
associate it to televisions, DVD players, and other electrical products.
 Considering that an ordinary consumer will likely associate the word 
"Kolin" with electrical products, the consumer might mistakenly believe 
that all electric products bearing the word "Kolin" emanate from one 
company.







Taken together, it is more likely that the public will be confused when 
confronted with identical KOLIN marks because the word "Kolin" leaves 
the same visual, aural, and commercial impression in the minds of the 
public. If KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark is allowed registration, the distinctiveness of KECI's 
KOLIN

 mark, which is also its trade name, will diminish because the public 
will likely associate the word "Kolin" with electronic products produced
 by another company which also uses the word "Kolin" as its trade name.
[14]


III.

The goods covered by the KOLIN marks are related goods.






A. Abandonment of "same 
descriptive properties" and "same class of merchandise" as factors in 
determining the relatedness of goods




 






Relative to the question of confusion of marks, the Court noted two 
types of confusion, namely: (1) confusion of goods; and (2) confusion of
 business. Confusion of goods exists when an ordinary prudent purchaser 
would be induced to buy a product of a manufacturer under the belief 
that it is the product of another manufacturer. On the other hand, 
confusion of business exists when the product of a manufacturer, 
although different from the other, is such as might reasonably be 
assumed to originate from the other or when the public would be deceived
 that there is some connection between the two manufacturers even if 
such connection does not exist.
[15]

 Simply stated, there is confusion of goods when the goods covered by 
the subject marks are the same or competing goods. Meanwhile, there is 
confusion of business when the goods are so related that the public 
would likely assume that they are produced by the same manufacturer or 
that there is some connection between the manufacturers.



In 
Taiwan Kolin
, the parties' goods are different. KECI's goods 
are power supplies and stereo boosters while TKC's goods are televisions
 and DVD players. Thus, there is no confusion of goods. What was left 
for the Third Division to decide is whether the goods are so related 
that confusion of source or business might occur. 
Taiwan Kolin
 cited the following factors enumerated in 
Mighty Corporation v. E. & J. Gallo Winery
[16]
 (
Mighty Corporation
) in determining whether the goods are related:








(a)


 the business (and its location) to which the goods belong;






(b)


 
the class of product to which the goods belong;






(c)


 
the product's quality, quantity, or size, including the nature of the package, wrapper or container;






(d)


 
the nature and cost of the articles;






(e)


 the descriptive properties, physical 
attributes or essential characteristics with reference to their form, 
composition, texture or quality;






(f)


the purpose of the goods;






(g)


whether the article is bought for immediate consumption, that is, day-to-day household items;






(h)


 
the fields of manufacture;






(i)


 
the conditions under which the article is usually purchased; and






(j)


 the channels of trade through which the goods flow, how they are distributed, marketed, displayed and sold.
[17]







The Third Division continued by discussing the three cases cited in 
Mighty Corporation
.
 But then, a scrutiny of the Court's decisions in these cases only 
highlights the fact that the Court did not rely on the descriptive 
properties or inherent nature of the subject goods in determining their 
relatedness.


Acoje Mining Co. Inc. v. Director of Patents
[18]

 - In allowing the registration of the LOTUS mark for use on soy sauce 
despite its use on edible oil, the Court dismissed confusing similarity 
because of the appearance of the LOTUS mark in their respective labels 
and not because soy sauce and oil have different descriptive properties 
or physical attributes, thus:


[T]here is 
no denying that the possibility of confusion 
is remote considering the difference in the type used, the coloring, the
 petitioner's trademark being in yellow and red while that of the 
Philippine Refining Company being in green and yellow, and the much 
smaller size of petitioner's trademark
. When 
regard is had for 
the principle that the two trademarks in their entirety as they appear 
in their respective labels should be considered in relation to the goods
 advertised before registration could be denied, the conclusion is 
inescapable that respondent Director ought to have reached a different 
conclusion. Petitioner has successfully made out a case for registration
.
[19]
 (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted.)


Philippine Refining Co., Inc. v. Ng Sam
[20]

 - The Court held that ham is not related to lard, butter, cooking oil, 
abrasive detergents, polishing materials and soap such that consumers 
would not likely mistake one as the source or origin of the product of 
the other. Although the Court additionally described the inherent 
properties of the products, it all boils down to the question of whether
 there is confusion of source. The Court ruled that there will be no 
confusion of source in this wise:


The observation and conclusion of the Director of Patents are correct. 
The
 particular goods of the parties are so unrelated that consumers would 
not in any probability mistake one as the source or origin of the 
product of the other.
 "Ham" is not a daily food fare for the average
 consumer. One purchasing ham would exercise a more cautious inspection 
of what he buys on account of its price. Seldom, if ever, is the 
purchase of said food product delegated to household helps, except 
perhaps to those who, like the cooks, are expected to know their 
business. 
Besides, there can be no likelihood for the consumer of 
respondent's ham to confuse its source as anyone but respondent. The 
facsimile of the label attached by him on his product, his business name
 "SAM'S HAM AND BACON FACTORY" written in bold white letters against a 
reddish orange background, is certain to catch the eye of the class of 
consumers to which he caters.


In addition, the goods of petitioners are basically derived from 
vegetable oil and animal fats, while the product of respondent is 
processed from pig's legs. 
A consumer would not reasonably assume that petitioner has so diversified its business as to include the product of respondent.
[21]
 (Emphases supplied; citation omitted.)


Hickok Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. CA
[22]

 - The Court's primary basis for discounting confusing similarity 
between the diverse articles of men's wear and shoes is the label of the
 latter which clearly identifies its source. Again, the Court did not 
rely on the descriptive properties factor of the goods involved.


Taking into account the facts of record that petitioner, 
a
 foreign corporation registered the trademark for its diverse articles 
of men's wear such as wallets, belts and men's briefs which are all 
manufactured here in the Philippines by a licensee Quality House, Inc.
 (which pays a royalty of 1-1/2% of the annual net sales) 
but are so labelled as to give the misimpression that the said goods are of foreign (stateside) manufacture
 and that 
respondent secured its trademark registration exclusively for shoes
 (which neither petitioner nor the licensee ever manufactured or traded in) and 
which are clearly labelled in block letters as "Made in Marikina, Rizal, Philippines,"

 no error can be attributed to the appellate court in upholding 
respondent's registration of the same trademark for his unrelated and 
non-competing product of Marikina shoes.
[23]
 (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted.)


Taiwan Kolin
 emphasized that the similarity of the products, and 
not their arbitrary classification, must be considered. In the same 
breath, it subÂ­categorized the goods in Class 9 to demonstrate the 
differences in the goods.


It bears to stress at this point that the list of 
products included in Class 9 can be sub-categorized into five (5) 
classifications, namely: (1) apparatus and instruments for scientific or
 research purposes, (2) information technology and audiovisual 
equipment, (3) apparatus and devices for controlling the distribution 
and use of electricity, (4) optical apparatus and instruments, and (5) 
safety equipment.
 From this subÂ­classification, it becomes apparent that petitioner's products, i.e., televisions and DVD players, belong to 
audiovisual equipment
,
 while that of respondent, consisting of automatic voltage regulator, 
converter, recharger, stereo booster, AC-DC regulated power supply, 
step-down transformer, and PA amplified AC-DC, generally fall under 
devices for 
controlling the distribution and use of electricity
.
[24]
 (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)



Although 
Mighty Corporation
 cited various factors, it appears 
that the Third Division mainly considered the absence of similarities in
 the descriptive properties and physical attributes of the goods in 
concluding that the goods are unrelated by sub-categorizing Class 9. The
 goods' 
descriptive properties, physical attributes or essential 
characteristics with reference to their form, composition, texture or 
quality
 (
descriptive properties factor
) is one of the factors enumerated in 
Mighty Corporation
; however, it bears stressing that exact similarity, as 
Taiwan Kolin

 suggests, should not be required for the goods to be considered 
related. Otherwise, the goods are identical rather than related.



To better understand the 
descriptive properties factor
, the Court's basis in 
Mighty Corporation
 must be discussed. In 
ESSO Standard Eastern, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
,
[25]
 (
Esso Standard
) the Court adopted the following factors enumerated by Callman in determining the relatedness of goods (Calllman's factors):


Goods are related when they belong to the 
same class
 or have the 
same descriptive properties
; when they possess the 
same physical attributes or essential characteristics with reference to their form, composition, texture or quality
.
 They may also be related because they serve the same purpose or are sold in grocery stores.
[26]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citation omitted.)



Interestingly, the phrase 
"same descriptive properties"
 was used 
in the United States' old 1905 Federal Trademark Act which provides that
 the applicant's mark will not be registered if such mark is also used 
by another on goods of the 
"same descriptive properties"
 as to be
 likely to cause confusion. However, the 1946 Lanham Act has done away 
with the old concept of "goods of the same descriptive properties" and 
removed such restriction.
[27]
 
But then, the basis of extending the trademark rights to include the 
protection of noncompetitive but related goods in the United States is 
the "Aunt Jemima doctrine" decided by the Second Circuit court in 1917, 
way before the 1946 Lanham Act.
[28]

 The court protected the AUNT JEMIMA mark being used on pancake batter 
from its use on pancake syrup. The court rejected the "competitive 
goods" doctrine and ruled that a mark will still be protected if used on
 any goods which the buyers would likely think to originate from the 
same source.
[29]









In the Philippines, Section 13 of the Protection and Registration of Trade-Marks and Trade-Names (Act No. 666)
[30]

 provides that "no alleged trade-mark or trade-name shall be registered 
which x x x is identical With a registered or known trade-mark owned by 
another and appropriate to the 
same class of merchandise
 x x x as
 to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public, 
or to deceive purchasers." Act No. 666 used the phrase 
"same class of merchandise"
 instead of 
"same descriptive properties."

 A plain reading of Act No. 666 indicates that trademark protection only
 extends to goods or merchandise of the same class. The phrase 
"same class of merchandise"
 was also omitted in RA No. 166.
[31]
 Nevertheless, the Court has recognized the confusion of business or source doctrine in 
Kalaw Ng Khe v. Lever Brothers Co.
[32]
 (
Ng Khe
) and 
Ang v. Teodoro
,
[33]
 (
Teodoro
) decided in 1941 and 1942, respectively, or before the approval of RA No. 166 in 1947. In 
Ng Khe
,
 the Court held that while hair pomade and soap are noncompetitive, they
 are similar or belong to the same class of toiletries. As such, the 
marks "LUX" and "LIFEBUOY" may not be used on hair pomade. In 
Teodoro
,
 the Court considered shoes and shirts as related goods because the 
trademark and trade name "Ang Tibay" has come to indicate the origin and
 ownership of the goods.



To reconcile the seeming conflict between the aforementioned laws and 
relevant jurisprudence on related goods, a review of the US and 
Philippine jurisprudence reveals that the phrases 
"same descriptive properties"
 and 
"same class of merchandise"
 should not be taken literally because they have no connection with the inherent nature of the goods.



The phrases 
"same descriptive properties"
 and 
"same class of merchandise"

 are not determinative of the relatedness of goods as suggested by 
Callman. Rather, it is the result of the relatedness of goods. Goods are
 considered to have the 
"same descriptive properties"
 and to be of the 
"same class of merchandise"
 when they are so related that the public will likely assume that they come from the same source. In 
Ng Khe
, the Court quoted the Court of Appeals' ruling that pomade and soap are goods of similar kind, 
viz
.:


The next point to be determined is whether pomade and soap are goods of similar kind. 
We are of the opinion that they are. Both are toilet articles.


"The owner of a trade-mark which is arbitrary, strange, 
and fanciful is entitled to a monopoly of use for his mark in a wider 
field
 than is he who employs a mark not of that character. Also, the 
nature
 of the business in which the trade-mark is used is, in some measure, 
determinative of whether certain goods are within the general class. 
It has been said that classification depends more on commercial custom than the inherent nature of the products.
"
 (63 CJ, 318-319.)


"The phrase '
same descriptive properties
' must be construed to effectuate the dominant purpose of a section to prevent confusion and deception
, as indicated by the first paragraph authorizing registration of a mark 
by which the goods of the owner may be distinguished from other goods of the same class, 
so that, whenever it appears that confusion might result, the goods have the same descriptive properties
. California Packing Corporation vs. Price Booker Mfg. Co. (1923) 285 F. 993, 52 App. D. C. 259, holding that 
pickles and condiments are goods of the same descriptive properties as canned fruits and vegetables
, since they are 
sold in the same stores
, put out in 
similar containers
, and 
used in connection with each other
, and a person seeing a trade-mark on a container of pickles 
would
 be likely to assume they were produced by the same concern as that 
which produced canned fruit or vegetables bearing a similar mark
.


x x x x


"If the use of the marks by the contending parties would be likely
 to lead the public to believe that the goods to which they are applied 
were produced by the same concern or person, the goods possess the 'same
 descriptive properties.'
 Application of BF Goodrich Co., (1923)
 285 995, 52 App. D. C., 261, holding that pneumatic tires for 
automobiles and rubber hose and belting have the same descriptive 
properties.
[34]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied.)





The CA's basis that the goods are related if the use of the marks will 
likely mislead the public as to its source is supported by US 
jurisprudence. The courts do not regard goods as related because of 
their inherent common quality. What is paramount is the confusion of 
source or the assumed connection between the parties.
[35]



As regards the use of the phrase 
"same class of merchandise"
 in Act No. 666, the Court's ruling in 
Teodoro
 is enlightening:


We have underlined the key words used in the statute: "goods of a similar kind," "general class of merchandise," 
"
same class of merchandise
,"
 "classes of merchandise," and "class of articles," because it is upon their implications that the result of the case hinges. 
These phrases, which refer to the same thing, have the same meaning as the phrase "
merchandise of the same descriptive properties
"
 used in the statutes and jurisprudence of other jurisdictions
.


x x x x


In the present state of development of the law on Trade-Marks, Unfair Competition, and Unfair Trading, 
the
 test employed by the courts to determine whether noncompeting goods are
 or are not of the same class is confusion as to the origin of the goods
 of the second user
. Although two noncompeting articles may be 
classified under two different classes
 by the Patent Office because they are deemed not to possess the same descriptive properties, 
they
 would, nevertheless, be held by the courts to belong to the same class 
if the simultaneous use on them of identical or closely similar 
trade-marks would be likely to cause confusion as to the origin, or 
personal source, of the second user's goods
.
 They would be considered as 
not
 falling under the same class only if they are so dissimilar or so 
foreign to each other as to make it unlikely that the purchaser would 
think the first user made the second user's goods
.
[36]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied).




In 
Ng Khe
, the CA's review of US jurisprudence demonstrates that the phrase 
"same descriptive properties"
 does not pertain to the inherent nature of the goods. To determine whether the goods have the 
"same descriptive properties,"
 the courts consider the prevalent commercial custom. In 
Teodoro
, to determine whether the goods are of the 
"same class of merchandise,"
 the courts consider confusion as to the origin of the goods of the second user. If the present concept of 
"same descriptive properties"
 is applied in 
Ng Khe
 and 
Teodoro
, hair pomade and soap and shoes and shirts do not have the 
"same descriptive properties"

 because their physical attributes or essential characteristics with 
reference to their form, composition, texture or quality are indubitably
 different.



Contrary to Callman's factors, goods are not considered related because 
they belong to the same class or have the same properties. 
Instead, 
goods are considered related if the parties' use of the marks will 
likely lead the public to believe that the goods covered by the marks 
come from the same source. Simply put, the relatedness of goods depends 
on whether there is confusion of source or of business. If there is 
confusion of source, then the goods are considered to have the "same 
descriptive properties" and to be of the "same class of merchandise."



It appears that 
Esso Standard
's citation of Callman's factors in determining the relatedness of goods paved the way for the interpretation that the phrase 
"same descriptive properties"
 pertains to the inherent nature of the goods and the phrase 
"same class of merchandise"
 pertains to the Nice Classification of goods. Notably, some of the Court's rulings since 
Ng Khe
 and 
Teodoro
 applied the phrases 
"same descriptive properties"
 and 
"same class of merchandise"
 literally. The Court, in 
Mighty Corporation
, showed the difference of the subject goods by describing their properties as follows:


Wines are bottled and consumed by drinking while cigarettes are packed in cartons or packages and smoked.

 There is a whale of a difference between their descriptive properties, 
physical attributes or essential characteristics like form, composition,
 texture and quality.
[37]
 (Emphasis supplied.)


The Court likewise considered the inherent nature and properties of milk
 products and its classification under the Nice Classification System in
 
Societe des Produits Nestle, S.A. v. Dy, Jr.
,
[38]
 thus:


NANNY and NAN have the 
same classification, descriptive properties and physical attributes
. Both are classified under 
Class 6
, both are 
milk products, and both are in powder form
. x x x.
[39]
 (Emphasis supplied.)



The present use of the phrases 
"same descriptive properties"
 and 
"same class of merchandise"

 are no longer the result of the relatedness of goods. These phrases 
have now become factors in determining whether the goods are related. 
Particularly, if the phrase 
"same descriptive properties"
 is to be applied literally, then only identical or competing goods will be considered as related. 
This
 interpretation is restrictive and inconsistent with the doctrine of 
confusion of business which presupposes that the goods, although 
different, are so related that the public will likely assume that they 
come from the same source.



In sum, I believe the literal application of 
"same descriptive properties"
 and 
"same class of merchandise"

 should be abandoned because they limit the application of the related 
goods doctrine and adversely affect the findings of relatedness of goods
 and confusion of source or business as demonstrated in 
Taiwan Kolin
. In 
Ng Khe
 and 
Teodoro
, the Court interpreted 
"same class of merchandise"
 and 
"same descriptive properties"
 as the result of the relatedness of goods and not as factors in determining relatedness of goods. The phrase 
"same class of merchandise"

 does not pertain to the Nice Classification of goods since the Nice 
Agreement, which established the international classification of goods, 
was only concluded in 1957,
[40]
 or before the promulgation of 
Ng Khe
 and 
Teodoro
. On the other hand, the phrase 
"same descriptive properties"
 does not pertain to the inherent nature of goods. Clearly, 
"same class of merchandise"
 and 
"same descriptive properties"
 should not be used as factors in determining the relatedness of goods.


B. The Present Case



KECI's 
KOLIN
 mark is registered for use on automatic 
voltage regulator, converter, recharger, stereo booster, AC-DC regulated
 power supply, step-down transformer, and PA amplified AC-DC. Meanwhile,
 KPII proposes the use of 
kol
i
n
 on television and
 DVD players. Evidently, KECI and KPII's goods are not in competition. 
This, however, does not preclude confusing similarity since the parties'
 goods are so related that an ordinary consumer would likely be confused
 as to their source or would likely assume a connection between the two 
companies, when actually there is none. The IPO-BLA's observation on 
this matter deserves credence.


In the instant case, the 
foregoing are deemed related 
goods. Home appliance is no far different from any electronic equipment.
 The terms, in fact are used interchangeably as most of the home 
appliance[s] are electronically operated, or home appliances are 
operated with electrical equipment or power supplies.
 Buyers of these goods go to the 
same channels of trade such as department stores or appliance stores where both goods are available for sale
. The apparent conclusion is 
public
 confusion that opposer's and respondent's respective goods are 
variation of each other and also the assumption that the goods 
originated from one manufacturer or source, when in fact, they did not
.


More so, opposer's 
evidence consisting of various e-mails (Exhibit "Q" and its sub-markings) it received from public consumers
 reflecting their complaints, concerns and other information 
about
 respondent's applicant's goods as televisions, air-conditioning units 
and DVD players, are obvious showing of actual confusion of goods as 
well as to origin or source of goods. These reveal factual confusion of 
the buying public between the marks in controversy
.
[41]
 (Emphases supplied.)



The relatedness of the parties' goods in this case and the resulting 
confusion of source or business are clearly supported by evidence on 
record. The various emails received by KECI pertaining to televisions 
and DVD players proved that the public was actually confused by the use 
of a mark bearing the word "Kolin" manufactured by another company. 
Hence,
 KECI's automatic voltage regulator, converter, recharger, stereo 
booster, AC-DC regulated power supply, step-down transformer, and PA 
amplified ACÂ­DC and KPII's television and DVD players are deemed to have
 the same descriptive properties and to belong to the same class of 
merchandise pursuant to the Court's ruling in 
Ng Khe
 and 
Teodoro
.


IV.

The application of intelligent buyer doctrine will not reduce confusing similarity.



In determining confusing similarity, another important factor is the 
"ordinary purchaser" who will likely be deceived or confused with the 
goods or its source. The Court attempted to describe an "ordinary 
purchaser" in various cases. In 
Fruit of the Loom, Inc. v. CA
,
[42]
 the Court, citing US cases,
[43]

 thought of an "ordinary purchaser" as one who must be credited with at 
least a modicum of intelligence to be able to perceive the obvious 
differences between the marks.
[44]
 Meanwhile, in 
Dy Buncio v. Tan Tiao Bok
,
[45]

 the Court supposed that an "ordinary purchaser" is one who is 
accustomed to buy the subject goods and is somehow familiar with it.
[46]
 Likewise, the Court, in 
Emerald Garment Manufacturing Corp. v. CA
,
[47]
 (
Emerald Garment
)
 regarded an "ordinary purchaser" as one who is not the completely 
unwary consumer but an ordinarily intelligent buyer considering the type
 of product involved.
[48]



In 
Taiwan Kolin
, the Third Division relied on the ordinary intelligent buyer concept in 
Emerald Garment

 and considered electronic products as luxury items to conclude that an 
ordinary purchaser is predisposed to be more cautious and discriminating
 in making a purchase. The relevant portions of the decision are as 
follows:


It cannot be stressed enough that the products involved 
in the case at bar are, generally speaking, various kinds of electronic 
products. These are not ordinary consumable household items,
 like catsup, soy sauce or soap which are of minimal cost. 
The
 products of the contending parties are relatively luxury items not 
easily considered affordable. Accordingly, the casual buyer is 
predisposed to be more cautious and discriminating in and would prefer 
to mull over his purchase. Confusion and deception,
 then, is less likely. As further elucidated in 
Del Monte Corporation v. Court of Appeals
:


x x x Among these, what essentially determines the attitudes
 of the purchaser, specifically his inclination to be cautious, is the 
cost of the goods. To be sure, a person who buys a box of candies will 
not exercise as much care as one who buys an expensive watch. As a 
general rule, an ordinary buyer does not exercise as much prudence in 
buying an article for which he pays a few centavos as he does in 
purchasing a more valuable thing. Expensive and valuable items are 
normally bought only after deliberate, comparative and analytical 
investigation. But mass products, low priced articles in wide use, and 
matters of everyday purchase requiring frequent replacement are bought 
by the casual consumer without great care x x x. (Emphasis supplied.)



Respondent has made much reliance on 
Arce & Sons, Chua Che, Ang, and Khe
,
 oblivious that they involved common household items - i.e., biscuits 
and milk, cosmetics, clothes, and toilet articles, respectively - 
whereas the extant case involves luxury items not regularly and 
inexpensively purchased by the consuming public. In accord with common 
empirical experience, the useful lives of televisions and DVD players 
last for about five (5) years, minimum, making replacement purchases 
very infrequent. The same goes true with converters and regulators that 
are seldom replaced despite the acquisition of new equipment to be 
plugged onto it. 
In addition, the amount the buyer would be parting 
with cannot be deemed minimal considering that the price of televisions 
or DVD players can exceed today's monthly minimum wage. In light of 
these circumstances, it is then expected that the ordinary intelligent 
buyer would be more discerning when it comes to deciding which 
electronic product they are going to purchase, and it is this standard 
which this Court applies herein in determining the likelihood of 
confusion should petitioner's application be granted.


To be sure, the extant case is 
reminiscent of 
Emerald Garment Manufacturing Corporation v. Court of Appeals
,
 wherein the opposing trademarks are that of Emerald Garment 
Manufacturing Corporation's "Stylistic Mr. Lee" and H.D. Lee's "LEE." In
 the said case, the appellate court affirmed the decision of the 
Director of Patents denying Emerald Garment's application for 
registration due to confusing similarity with H.D. Lee's trademark. 
This
 Court, however, was of a different beat and ruled that there is no 
confusing similarity between the marks, given that the products covered 
by the trademark, i.e., jeans, were, at that time, considered pricey, 
typically purchased by intelligent buyers familiar with the products and
 are more circumspect, and, therefore, would not easily be deceived.
 x x x.
[49]
 (Emphases supplied; citations omitted.)



In my opinion, 
Taiwan Kolin
 again failed to consider the 
particular circumstances of the case in concluding that there is no 
confusing similarity pursuant to the ordinary intelligent buyer 
doctrine. Granting that various electronic products are expensive enough
 to make an ordinary buyer more cautious and discerning of his or her 
purchase, the unanswered question is whether a further examination of 
the goods will reduce confusing similarity. Obviously, the various 
emails received by KECI requesting for information or service and 
complaints about TKC's goods answer this question in the negative.



Even if ordinary consumers of electronic products are cautious and 
discerning enough to further investigate about the goods and their 
source, they will be confronted with two companies which both use the 
word "Kolin" as their trade names. Instead of concluding that the 
electronic products came from different companies, human nature and 
experience dictate that ordinary consumers will only assume a reasonable
 connection between Taiwan Kolin Corporation, LTD. and Kolin Electronics
 Co., Inc. especially since they both produce electronic goods under the
 KOLIN marks and trade names.



It must be stressed that the determination of confusing similarity 
should not end in identifying whether ordinary purchasers are cautious 
enough to investigate and examine the differences between the marks and 
the goods that they cover. I believe the courts must also consider 
whether a careful examination of goods will reduce or increase confusing
 similarity. To reiterate, each case of determining confusing similarity
 must be decided based on its particular circumstances which include the
 ordinary purchaser's attitude. After all, it would be unfair to place 
the burden of distinguishing the goods of one manufacturer from the 
other on ordinary consumers. The law on trademarks does not only protect
 the rights of trademark owners to use their marks on their goods. More 
importantly, it seeks to protect the welfare of the consuming public by 
eliminating confusion of goods and of business even before they occur.



Accordingly, I vote to 
GRANT
 the petition.

CONCURRING OPINION
PERALTA, C.J.:



As one of the former members of the Court's Third Division who concurred in the 
ponencia
 of Mr. Justice Velasco in 
Taiwan Kolin Corp., Ltd.
 (TKC) 
v. Kolin Electronics, Co., Inc.
 (KECI) (
Taiwan Kolin case
),
[1]
 I deem it incumbent upon me to acknowledge the shortcomings of said decision, as eloquently pointed out in the present 
ponencia

 of Mr. Justice Caguioa, and correct, with the present concurrence, what
 has been deemed a sore thumb in our jurisprudence on trademarks for the
 past half-decade.





Admittedly, the 
Taiwan Kolin
 case failed to apply the Dominancy Test, which I had applied in the prior case of 
Skechers, U.S.A., Inc. v. Inter Pacific Industrial Trading Corp.
[2]
 and which has been incorporated in the current law on trademarks,
[3]
 to determine whether the competing marks are confusingly similar. I agree with the 
ponencia
 that applying said test, KECI's 
KOLIN

 mark is clearly confusingly similar in terms of its appearance to TKC's
 KOLIN mark because the work "KOLIN" is the prevalent feature of the 
former's mark which is reproduced entirely in the latter's mark. 
Further, while there may be minor visual differences in terms of font, 
color, and background, they are phonetically or aurally identical.
[4]

 Indeed, in several cases, the aural similarity of the competing marks 
was found sufficient to support a finding of confusing similarity. For 
instance, We applied the dominancy test in holding that "PCO-GENOLS" and
 "PYCOGENOL,"
[5]
 "MACJOY" and "MCDONALD'S,"
[6]
 "DERMALINE DERMALINE INC." and "DERMALIN,"
[7]
 "BIG MAC" and "BIG MAK,"
[8]
 and "NANNY" and "NAN"
[9]
 are confusingly similar.








 






The 
Taiwan Kolin
 case also failed to determine confusion of business. As pointed out in 
Skechers
,
 confusion of business (source or origin confusion), where, although the
 goods of the parties are different, the product, the mark of which 
registration is applied for by one party, is such as might reasonably be
 assumed to originate with the registrant of an earlier product, and the
 public would then be deceived either into that belief or into the 
belief that there is some connection between the two parties, though 
inexistent.
[10]
 The mark of 
which registration is applied for by TKC is such as might reasonably be 
assumed to originate from KECI, considering that it is not impossible 
for their respective products to be sold in home goods and appliance 
stores and, therefore, lead consumers to believe that there is some 
connection between the two parties, though inexistent, thus, resulting 
in confusion of business.



In 
In Re Shell Oil Co.
,
[11]
 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
[12]

 held that "even when goods or services are not competitive or 
intrinsically related, the use of identical marks can lead to the 
assumption that there is a 
common source
." Citing said case, the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (
TMEP
) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (
USPTO
) states:
1207.01(a) Relatedness of the Goods or Services


In assessing the relatedness of the goods and/or services, the more 
similar the marks at issue, the less similar the goods or services need 
to be to support a finding of likelihood of confusion.
 
In re Shell Oil Co.
, 992 F.2d 1204, 1207, 26 USPQ2d 1687, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 1993); 
Gen. Mills, Inc. v. Fage Dairy Processing Indus. S.A.
, 100 USPQ2d 1584, 1597 (TTAB 2011); 
In re lola Techs., LLC
, 95 USPQ2d 1498, 1499 (TTAB 2010); 
In re Opus One Inc.
, 60 USPQ2d 1812, 1815 (TTAB 2001). 
If
 the marks of the respective parties are identical or virtually 
identical, the relationship between the goods and/or services need not 
be as close to support a finding of likelihood of confusion as would be 
required if there were differences between the marks.
 
Shell Oil
, 992 F.2d at 1207, 26 USPQ2d at 1689; 
In re Davey Prods. Pty Ltd.
, 92 USPQ2d 1198, 1202 (TTAB 2009); 
In re Thor Tech, Inc.
, 90 USPQ2d 1634, 1636 (TTAB 2009).
[13]




In the case at bench, applying the Dominancy Test, there is no doubt 
that the marks of KECI and KPII are confusingly similar since the 
latter's mark appropriates the former's mark in its entirety, thus 
making origin confusion more likely. Further, applying the factors for 
determining relatedness of goods in 
Mighty Corporation v. E. & J. Gallo Winery
,
[14]
 as comprehensively discussed in the ponencia, one can reasonably conclude that KECI's and KPII's goods are related.



At this point, however, I wish to note that in hindsight, the 
Taiwan Kolin
 case should not have considered Class 9 subcategorization as a factor in determining relatedness, just as the 
Mighty Corporation
 case should not have considered product classification. While 
Mighty Corporation

 included "the class of product to which the goods belong" for the first
 time in the enumeration of factors to be considered in arriving at a 
sound conclusion on the question of relatedness, a review of the 
relevant laws, regulations, and related literature would reveal that 
there was no legal basis therefor.



Section 6 of Republic Act (
R.A.
) No. 166,
[15]
 one of the precursors of R.A. No. 8293, or the 
Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines
, provides:
Section 6. 
Classification of goods and services
.
 - The Director shall establish a classification of goods and services, 
for the convenience of the Patent Office administration, but not to limit or extend the applicant's rights
. x x x.
[16]



The above provision was reproduced substantially from Section 30 of the Lanham Act, also known as the 
Trademark Act of 1946
, which is codified at 15 U.S.C. Â§1112, as amended, as follows:
Â§1112. Classification of goods and services; registration in plurality of classes


The Commissioner may establish a classification of goods and services, 
for convenience of Patent and Trademark Office administration, but not to limit or extend the applicant's or registrant's rights
. x x x.
[17]



In 
Jean Patou, Inc. v. Theon, Inc.
,
[18]

 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had the opportunity 
to discuss the irrelevance of classification with respect to 
registrability of marks, to wit:


The benefits of a Principal Register registration apply with
 respect to the goods named in the registration without regard to the 
class or classes named in the registration. The statute authorizing the 
establishment of a classification is 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1112 which provides:


The Commissioner may establish a classification of goods and services, 
for
 the convenience of the Patent and Trademark Office administration, but 
not to limit or extend the applicant's or registrant's rights
.


It is elementary that a registrant has rights under the statute only 
with respect to goods on which the trademark has been used. Trademark 
ownership results only from use, not from registration. 
Classification is to facilitate searching for registered marks which is primarily what is meant by "the convenience of the" PTO.
 See also 37 CFR Sec. 2.85(g) ("Classification schedules shall not limit or extend the applicant's rights.").


In our view, all of the TTAB's reasoning with respect to what it viewed 
as the Class 3 goods applies with equal force to registration in Class
5 and leads to the same result, namely, likelihood of confusion and 
sustaining of the opposition. The result reached by the TTAB with 
respect to registration in class 5 is incongruous. With respect to 
applicant's single product the decision was that the mark DERMAJOY is 
both registrable and not registrable, depending on the classification 
designated. 
However, classification is 
wholly irrelevant
 to the issue of registrability under section 1052(d), which makes no reference to classification.
 x x x.
[19]



Notably, the TMEP has, likewise, cited the above case in determining the import of classification in trademark evaluations, 
viz
.:


1207.01(d)(v) Classification of Goods/Services


The classification of goods and services has 
no bearing
 on the question of likelihood of confusion.
 
See Jean Patou, Inc. v. Theon Inc.
, 9 F.3d 971, 975, 29 USPQ2d 1771, 1774 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
Rather, it is the manner in which the applicant and/or registrant have identified their goods or services that is controlling.
 
See Nat'l Football League v. Jasper Alliance Corp.
, 16 USPQ2d 1212, 1216 & n.5 (TTAB 1990).
[20]



Even prior to 
Jean Patou
, the U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) in 
INB National Bank v. Metrohost, Inc.
[21]

 had already held that "it is well recognized that the system of 
dividing goods [and services] into classes is purely a manner of 
convenience and that a determination on the question of likelihood of 
confusion cannot be restricted by the artificial boundary created by 
classification."





With the enactment of R.A. No. 8293, Section 6 of R.A. No. 166 became what is now Section 144 of the Intellectual Property Code:


Section 144. 
Classification of Goods and Services.
 - x x x


144.2. 
Goods or services may not be considered as being similar or 
dissimilar to each other on the ground that, in any registration or 
publication by the Office, they appear in different classes of the Nice 
Classification.
 (Sec. 6, R.A. No. 166a)
[22]



In turn, Section 144.2 of R.A. No. 8293 was patterned after Rule 2(4) of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2868/95 implementing Council Regulation No. 40/94 on the Community trade mark
,
[23]
 as amended, which states as follows:


(4) The classification of goods and services shall serve 
exclusively

 administrative purposes. Therefore, goods and services may not be 
regarded as being similar to each other on the ground that they appear 
in the same class under the Nice Classification, and goods and services 
may not be regarded as being dissimilar from each other on the ground 
that they appear in different classes under the Nice Classification.
[24]


In fine
, the fact that goods or services are listed in the same 
or different classes of the NCL, or same or different subcategories 
thereof for that matter, is not, 
in itself
, an indication of similarity or dissimilarity. For instance, 
live animals
 and 
flowers
 both belong to Class 31, yet are dissimilar. 
Advertising
 and 
office functions
 are found in Class 35, yet are also dissimilar. On the other hand, 
meat extracts
 (Class 29) and 
spices
 (Class 30) belong to different classes, yet are similar. 
Travel arrangement
 (Class 39) and 
providing temporary accommodation
 (Class 43) are likewise found in different classes, yet are also similar.
[25]



Fundamentally, the NCL serves 
purely
 administrative purposes, 
i.e.
,
 the harmonization of national classification practices, and does not, 
in itself, provide a basis for drawing conclusions as to the similarity 
of goods and services.
[26]
 It 
is merely a way for trademark offices to organize the thousands of 
applications that are filed each year. Use of the NCL by national 
offices has the advantage that trademark applications are coordinated 
with reference to a single classification system. Filing is thereby 
greatly simplified, as the goods and services to which a given mark 
applies will be classified the same in all countries that have adopted 
the system.
[27]



Despite the purely administrative purpose of the NCL, the Court, in 
Mighty Corporation

 and in subsequent cases, saw fit to use the classification therein as 
one of the factors in determining relatedness, perhaps due to the 
convenience and expediency that such a system provides. After all, the 
NCL does not randomly categorize goods or services together. By the fact
 that goods are organized by class instead of alphabetically, it is not 
unreasonable to infer that there is some unifying theme among goods of 
the same class that makes them similar in a certain respect. However, as
 discussed, that does not mean that all goods in a particular class are 
legally related, and that goods belonging to different classes are 
legally unrelated.



Indeed, ours is the only jurisdiction that considers international 
classification as a factor in determining relatedness. In the United 
Kingdom, the following factors are taken into account in assessing the 
similarity of goods and services:






a) 


the uses of the respective goods or services;






b)


 the users of the respective goods or services;






c)


 
the physical nature of the goods or acts of service;






d)


 
the trade channels through which the goods or services reach the market;






e)


 
in the case of self-serve consumer items, 
where in practice they are respectively found or likely to be found in 
supermarkets and in particular whether they are, or are likely to be, 
found on the same or different shelves;






f)


 the extent to which the respective goods or services are in competition with each other.
[28]







The French Government likewise considers that, in assessing the 
similarity of goods and services, the factors to be taken into account 
should include the nature of the goods or service, their intended 
destination and clientele, their normal use, and the usual manner of 
their distribution.
[29]



The EUIPO Guidelines, Part C, Section 2, Chapter 2,
[30]
 have adopted and summarized the above factors as follows:






Canon
 factors


Additional factors


 






â¢ nature,

â¢ intended purpose,

â¢ method of use,

â¢ complementarity,

â¢ in competition.


â¢ distribution channels,

â¢ relevant public,

â¢ the usual origin of the goods/services.


 





 


The ASEAN Common Guidelines for the Substantive Examination of Trademarks
[31]
 have likewise adopted the above factors and state that they "
should
 be taken into account to establish similarity of goods and services."



What is clear is that none of the foregoing laws, jurisprudence, and 
guidelines make reference to international classification of goods as a 
factor in determining relatedness. Given the foregoing discussion, it 
would be more in keeping with the purpose of the NCL for the Court to 
abandon product classification as a factor in determining relatedness. 
The rest of the factors enumerated in 
Mighty Corporation
 are sufficient for that purpose.

SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION


PERLAS-BERNABE, J.:





I concur. The petition should be granted.



Contrary to the Courts of Appeals' (CA) ruling, 
res judicata
 
whether in the concept of "bar by prior judgment" or "conclusiveness of 
judgment" - holds no application in this case. Thus, it erred in 
granting respondent Kolin Philippines International, Inc.'s (KPII) 
Trademark Application No. 4-2006-010021 for the mark 
kol
i
n
 over the opposition of petitioner Kolin Electronics Co., Inc. (KECI), the registered owner
[1]
 of the word mark 
KOLIN
.


I.



To recount, the CA's application of the 
res judicata
 doctrine was based on the final judgment in 
Taiwan Kolin Corporation, Ltd. (TKC) v. Kolin Electronics Co., Inc.
[2]
 (
2015 Taiwan Kolin
), which was decided by the Court's then-Third Division on March 25, 2015.




In 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
, the Court upheld the Intellectual Property Office's (IPO) ruling to give due course to TKC's application for the 
KOLIN
 mark covering "
television and DVD player
"
[3]
 notwithstanding KECI's ownership of the 
KOLIN
 mark covering the goods "
automatic
 voltage regulator, converter, recharger, stereo booster, AC-DC 
regulated power supply, step-down transformer, PA amplified AC-DC
."
[4]
 Notably, it is observed that KECI's 
KOLIN
 mark is a word mark,
[5]

 which means that the word "Kolin" itself is protected for the use of 
the said mark to represent the same/related goods and products for which
 such registration was granted.




In this case, the CA found that KPII was an affiliate of TKC, who had been expressly authorized to adopt and use the 
KOLIN
 mark in the Philippines, which mark TKC owns by virtue of 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
. Thus, considering TKC's ownership of the 
KOLIN

 mark, and TKC's authorization in favor of KPII to adopt and use the 
same, the CA concluded that KPII should be allowed to register its own 
Kol
i
n
 mark covering "television set and DVD players" despite the opposition of KECI. According to the CA, the doctrine of 
res judicata
 forbids it from reaching a conclusion contrary to the 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
 final judgment, 
viz
.:


In fact, in the recent case of 
Taiwan Kolin Corporation, Ltd. v. Kolin Electronics, Co., Inc.

 (TKCL case), a case substantially similar to the present case, the 
Supreme Court already ruled that [TKC], to which KPII is affiliated, can
 register the mark "KOLIN" for the goods television and DVD player 
despite the opposition of KECI.
 The ruling of the Court is instructive, thus:


x x x x


From the foregoing, 
it is clear that KPII may register the mark "KOLIN" for its television set and DVD players. 
The doctrine of 
res judicata
 forbids us from arriving at a contrary conclusion
.
 A longÂ­established doctrine on litigation, 
res judicata

 is an old axiom of law, dictated by wisdom and sanctified by age, and 
founded on the broad principle that it is to the interest of the public 
that there should be an end to litigation by the same parties over a 
subject once fully and fairly adjudicated. It has been appropriately 
said that the doctrine is a rule pervading every well-regulated system 
of jurisprudence, and is put upon two grounds embodied in various maxims
 of the common law; one, public policy and necessity, which makes it to 
the interest of the State that there should be an end to litigation - 
interes republicae ut sit finis litium
; the other, the hardship on the individual that he should be vexed twice for one and the same cause 
nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa
.
 A contrary doctrine would subject the public peace and quiet to the 
will and neglect of individuals and prefer the gratification of the 
litigious disposition on the part of suitors to the preservation of the 
public tranquility and happiness. The elements of 
res judicata
 
are: (1) the former judgment must be final; (2) the former judgment must
 have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter
 and the parties; (3) the former judgment must be a judgment on the 
merits; and (4) there must be between the first and subsequent actions 
(i) identity of parties or at least such as representing the same 
interest in both actions; (ii) identity of subject matter; or of the 
rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the 
same facts; and, (iii) identity of causes of action in both actions such
 that any judgment that may be rendered in the other action will, 
regardless of which party is successful, amount to 
res judicata
 in the action under consideration.




All of these requisites are fulfilled in the instant case. While KPII 
may not be involved in the TKCL case, it must be noted that KPII is an 
affiliate company of [TKC], as admitted by KECI. An absolute identity of
 parties is not required for 
res judicata
 to apply, for as long as there exists an identity or community of interest.
[6]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)



The CA is mistaken. 
Res judicata
 does not apply in this case.


II.


Res judicata
 means "'a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted 
upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment.' It lays the 
rule that an existing final judgment or decree rendered on the merits, 
without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon 
any matter within its jurisdiction, is conclusive of the rights of the 
parties or their privies, in all other actions or suits in the same or 
any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction on the points and
 matters in issue in the first suit."
[7]



 



 
As earlier intimated, 
res judicata
 contemplates two (2) concepts. These are:


(
a
) 
bar by prior judgment
, which means that 
"the judgment or decree of the court of competent jurisdiction on the 
merits concludes the litigation between the parties, as well as their 
privies, and 
constitutes 
a bar to a new action or suit
 involving the same cause of action
 before the same or any other tribunal";
[8]
 and



(
b
) 
conclusiveness of judgment
, which means that "
any right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action
 before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and 
cannot again be litigated
 between the parties and their privies, 
whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or 
subject matter
 of the two actions is the same
."
[9]








 


While "bar by prior judgment" requires an identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action,
[10]
 "conclusiveness of judgment" only requires 
identity of issues and parties
.



At this juncture, I deem it apt to clarity that some formulations of 
"conclusiveness of judgment" in case law as loosely referring to 
"identity of subject matter"
[11]
 are inaccurate. I find that this clarification is relevant to this case because in its petition, KECI asserts
[12]
 that there is no "conclusiveness of judgment" since the subject matter in 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
 is the registration of the 
KOLIN
 mark, while the subject matter of this case is KPII's 
kol
i
n
. In other words, KECI postulates that the 
subject matter in general
 of both cases
are different and hence, "conclusiveness of judgment" does not apply in this case.



However, this is misnomer; contrary to the posturing of KECI,
[13]

 identity of the subject matter of litigation in general is not required
 for "conclusiveness of judgment." The definition cited above, in fact, 
makes it clear that "conclusiveness of judgment" means that "any right, 
fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in 
the determination of an action before a competent court in which 
judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the 
judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and 
their privies, 
whether or 
not
 the claim, demand, purpose, or 
subject matter
 of the two actions is the same
."
[14]



Rather, only the identity of a 
particular matter
, fact or issue raised in litigation - 
as opposed to the subject matter of the litigation in general

 - is required for "conclusiveness of judgment" to operate. This 
narrower limitation is more in accord with the concept's essence which 
is to preclude a re-litigation of "
any right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action
."
 This is in contrast with the broader import of "identity of subject 
matter" as used in "bar by prior judgment," which should refer to the 
identity of the subject matter of litigation in general because this 
latter concept of 
res judicata
 does not merely preclude raising 
an issue in litigation but instead, constitutes an affirmative defense, 
(usually raised in a motion to dismiss) that 
forecloses the entire action itself
.





In 
Degayo v. Magbanua-Dinglasan
,
[15]

 the Court had the occasion to explain the narrow precluding effect of 
conclusiveness of judgment based on its discussion that "only the 
identities of parties and 
issues
 are required for the operation of the principle of conclusiveness of judgment," 
viz
.:


Conclusiveness of judgment finds application when a fact or 
question has been squarely put in issue, judicially passed upon, and 
adjudged in a former suit by a court of competent jurisdiction. The fact
 or question settled by final judgment or order binds the parties to 
that action (and persons in privity with them or their 
successors-in-interest), and continues to bind them while the judgment 
or order remains standing and unreversed by proper authority on a timely
 motion or petition; the conclusively settled fact or question 
furthermore cannot again be litigated in any future or other action 
between the same parties or their privies and successors-in-interest, in
 the same or in any other court of concurrent jurisdiction, either for 
the same or for a different cause of action. 
Thus, only the identities of parties and issues are required for the operation of the principle of conclusiveness of judgment.


While conclusiveness of judgment does not have the same barring effect 
as that of a bar by former judgment that proscribes subsequent actions, 
the
 former nonetheless estops the parties from raising in a later case the 
issues or points that were raised and controverted, and were 
determinative of the ruling in the earlier case
. In other words, 
the
 dictum laid down in the earlier final judgment or order becomes 
conclusive and continues to be binding between the same parties, their 
privies and successors-in-interest, as long as the facts on which that 
judgment was predicated continue to be the facts of the case or incident
 before the court in a later case
; the binding effect and 
enforceability of that earlier dictum can no longer be re-litigated in a
 later case since the issue has already been resolved and finally laid 
to rest in the earlier case.
[16]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied)



KECI's misconception of "conclusiveness of judgment" notwithstanding, 
still, the CA's ruling remains riddled with error because both concepts 
of 
res judicata
 hold no application in this case.





To be sure, 
res judicata
 in the concept of "bar by prior 
judgment" does not apply since the subject matters of litigation and 
necessarily, the causes of action between 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
 and the present case are not identical. In particular, the 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
 case involves TKC's Trademark Application No. 4-1996-106310 for 
KOLIN

 covering televisions and DVD players, while the present case involves 
KPII's own act of filing a different Trademark Application No. 
4-2006-010021 for the mark 
kol
i
n
, albeit also covering the same goods, 
i.e.
,
 televisions and DVD players. When distinct trademark applications 
seeking for different trademark registrations are filed in separate 
cases - as in this case - 
res judicata
 in the concept of "bar by 
prior judgment" cannot apply due to the basic lack of identity in 
subject matters and causes of action.









 


In fact, while it is not explicitly stated in the CA's decision, it is highly apparent that the CA did not apply 
res judicata

 in the concept of "bar by prior judgment" for to do so would be to bar 
KPII's subsequent trademark application and hence, its petition before 
the CA in this case. Quite the opposite, the CA actually ruled in favor 
of KPII and thus allowed its action. Further, the CA utilized the 
2015 Taiwan Kolin

 final judgment, and held that it could not have deviated from the 
findings in the said case. Hence, what the CA truly applied was 
res judicata

 in the concept of "conclusiveness of judgment" under the notion that 
the ownership of the mark "Kolin" has already been settled in favor of 
TKC and in turn, should now benefit KPII as the former's 
assignee/affiliate. In the end, the CA ruled that KPII should be allowed
 to register its own 
kol
i
n
 mark over the opposition of KECI.



However, it should be discerned that 
the CA's application of 
res judicata
 in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment failed to take into account the nature of TKC's 
KOLIN
 mark as a mere design mark, which attribution should consequently limit the legal effects of the 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
 final judgment
. As will be discussed below, 
TKC
 - having been adjudged as the owner of a mere design mark - could have 
only assigned to KPII the right to adopt and use its mark under the 
specific stylization and design of 
KOLIN
. As the owner of a mere 
design mark, TKC was not accorded any exclusive right to use the word 
"Kolin" in whatever future stylizations it may deem fit for the pursuit 
of its trade or business. 
This is unlike the owner of a word mark who
 enjoys exclusive protection over the words, letters, or numbers 
themselves in the registered mark and, hence, gives it (as well as its 
privies) the right to adopt the protected word, letters, or numbers in 
whatever stylized versions for the same type of goods and services.




III.



Based on widely-accepted intellectual property law principles, the 
protection of the rights accorded under a word mark is far greater than 
that accorded under a design or a stylized mark.




As defined by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a 
design mark or stylized mark is a mark which consists of not only 
characters, but also a specific design, color, or some other distinctive
 element.
[17]



On the other hand, a word mark is defined by the WIPO as a mark composed
 of only words, letters, numbers, or a combination of them.
[18]

 While our own trademark rules do not expressly define a word mark, it 
nonetheless describes what a word mark does not constitute:


In the case of word marks or if 
no special 
characteristics have to be shown, such as design, style of lettering, 
color, diacritical marks, or unusual forms of punctuation, the mark must
 be represented in standard characters
. The specification of the mark to be reproduced will be indicated in the application form and/ or published on the website.
[19]




Based on the foregoing, what therefore sets apart a design mark from a 
word mark is the lack of special characteristics and that it is plainly 
exhibited in standard characters only. This lack of any peculiar 
characterization of style or design evinces that the word in itself (and
 not its style representation) is intended to be protected.



At this juncture, the nature of TKC's 
KOLIN
 mark must be examined since KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark merely rides on the strength of 
KOLIN
. In fact, this is the exact import of the CA's ratiocination as demonstrated by its application of the 
res judicata
 doctrine.


IV.



While the records of this case do not include the trademark application 
and registration of TKC (as this is a case between KECI and KPII), it 
can still be reasonably inferred that TKC's 
KOLIN
 mark is a 
design mark and not a word mark because of its obvious specific 
stylization and design appearing on its face. As previously discussed, 
the indication of what constitutes a word mark is that no special 
characteristics have to be shown, such as design, style of lettering, 
color, diacritical marks, or unusual forms of punctuation, and that the 
mark is merely represented in standard characters, which description 
does not square with TKC's 
KOLIN
.





In fact, the Court, in 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
, explicitly characterized TKC's 
KOLIN
 mark based on its special design, describing the same as "[colored] white in pantone red color background."
[20]
 Meanwhile, nowhere in 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
 was 
KOLIN
 referred to as a word mark, nor was there any reference to 
KOLIN
 as covering the word "Kolin" itself.



While the 
ponencia
 incisively pointed out
[21]
 that the Court's then-Third Division committed a mistake by describing TKC's other "Kolin" mark (
i.e.
, (image supposed to be here), under Application No. 4-2002-011002 which was already "refused [registration by the IPO] for non-filing of DAU/DNU"
[22]
), instead of 
KOLIN
 which was the true subject matter of TKC's application in 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
,
 this mistake does not negate the fact that the Court still accorded a 
specific description to TKC's mark and hence, implicitly characterized 
it as a design mark. To my mind, 
the fact of according a specific description to a mark
 
evinces
 that what was applied for was a design or stylized mark, as compared to
 a word mark which needs to be presented in standard characters only
. This intent is what appears on the face of the ruling in 
2015 Taiwan Kolin

 and thus, it must be assumed that the reference to the other (image supposed to be here) mark
 was a mere inadvertent error which does not take anything away from the
 Court's implicit appreciation of 
KOLIN
 as a design mark itself. Besides, it should be stressed that the only difference between 
KOLIN

 and (image supposed to be here) is the red color background and the color of the word 
"Kolin." The representation of "Kolin" in a special font, and not a 
default standard font, perceptibly squares with the character of 
stylized marks as was discussed here.



In comparison, there is evidence to show that KECI's 
KOLIN
 mark is a word mark based on its Certificate of Registration
[23]

 which is part of the records of this case. The certificate does not 
describe KECI's mark under any specific characterization and in fact, 
states that: "Claim of color: None," "Disclaimer: None," and 
"Translation or transliteration: None."
[24]

 Likewise, perusing the rulings of the Bureau of Trademarks, the Office 
of the President, and the final CA Decision in the case between KECI and
 TKC over 
KOLIN
, no specific description was taken into account by these bodies with respect to 
KOLIN
. This is, again, in contrast to TKC's 
KOLIN
 which was specially described by the Court based on a peculiar design and styling.




In fact, the established nature of KECI's 
KOLIN
 as a word mark strengthens the conclusion that TKC's 
KOLIN

 is a mere design mark. This is because a word mark accords protection 
to the words, letters, and numbers themselves; hence, it could not have 
been the intention of the Court's Third Division in 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
 to have two (2) word marks subsisting at the same time since it was already made aware of KECI's ownership of the 
KOLIN
 word mark, which was submitted as evidence in that case. A further exposition is fitting.




V.



According to the WIPO, 
a word mark "often provides broad 
protection because it allows the owner to limit a competitor's use of 
any figurative version of the trademark that is confusingly similar for 
the same type of goods or services
."
[25]
 Otherwise stated, 
"[t]he words and/or letters or numbers themselves are protected."
[26]



On the other hand, 
stylized marks offer narrow protection because 
"should the image change in any way, the registration loses its 
enforceability to an extent since it pertains to that exact 
registration."
[27]
 Simply put, 
the
 registrant of a stylized mark only gains rights and protection over the
 particular and specific stylization of the registered mark
.



Bearing in mind the varied scope of protection of design marks and word 
marks, it should be presumed that the Court's then-Third Division was 
well aware of KECI's ownership of the 
KOLIN
 word 1nark because its trademark registration therefor was the main subject of its opposition to TKC's 
KOLIN
, which fact was not only supported by evidence, but also settled by a final and executory judgment.
[28]
 Hence, in my humble opinion, 
the
 Court's then-Third Division could not have envisioned two (2) 
diametrically-opposed final and executory rulings awarding trademark 
ownership over the word "Kolin" to two (2) different entities
. 
Verily,
 not only would this scenario amount to an injustice on the part of KECI
 as the adjudged owner of the word mark, but likewise, propagate 
anomalous jurisprudence that defeats the very purpose of trademarks as 
source indicators in contravention of the policy of commercial stability
 underlying our trademark system.



In this relation, it is noted that the characterization of TKC's 
KOLIN
 mark (whether as a word or design mark) was not at issue in 
2015 Taiwan Kolin

 and consequently, was never traversed in the ruling of the Court's 
thenÂ­Third Division; hence, the present interpretation concerning the 
true nature of 
KOLIN
 does not technically contravene the immutability of judgment principle because nothing therein has been modified or reversed.



Meanwhile, the nature of TKC's 
KOLIN
 mark - while likewise not 
squarely raised as an issue here - is nonetheless necessary to arrive at
 a just disposition of this case; this is because of the indelible fact 
that KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark application rides on the strength of TKC's 
KOLIN
. As case law holds:


[T]he appellate court in deciding the case shall consider 
only the assigned errors, however, it is equally settled that the Court 
is clothed with ample authority to review matters 
not assigned as 
errors in an appeal, if it finds that their consideration is necessary 
to arrive at a just disposition of the case
.
[29]
 (Emphasis supplied)



Hence, by all the foregoing indications as well as the reasons aboveÂ­-explained, TKC's 
KOLIN
 mark should be deemed as a mere design mark,
while KECI's 
KOLIN
 a word mark, which facts are pertinent to the disposition of the present case.




VI.



Proceeding from the premise that TKC's 
KOLIN
 is a mere design or stylized mark, 
the issue anent the right to use the word "Kolin" in so far as KPII's Trademark Application No. 4-2006-010021 for the mark 
kol
i
n
 is concerned
 has thus - contrary to the CA's ruling - 
not been conclusively settled
. This therefore negates the application of the principle of "conclusiveness of judgment."




To explain, when TKC expressly authorized KPII to adopt and use its 
KOLIN
 mark in the Philippines and register the same in its business dealings, 
KPII only obtained rights over the specific stylized 
KOLIN
 mark of TKC, and not to the use of the word "Kolin" for the same goods or services
. 
Thus,
 KPII's new application should be indepedently treated as its own case 
without the benefit of the "conclusiveness of judgment principle" - at 
least insofar as the right to use the "Kolin" word in its 
Kol
i
n
 mark application filed in this case.





In other words, KPII's own stylized 
kol
i
n
 mark-described 
as "'kolin' in small-case letters; letter 'i' is [colored] orange while 
[letters] 'k, o, l, n' are in plain black"
[30]
 -
 must be treated as a fresh design mark application that must rise and 
fall on its own merits vis-a-vis KECI's opposition hinged upon the word 
mark 
KOLIN
. Accordingly, the new stylization of the 
kol
i
n
 mark and all factors related to such use 
constitute a new set of facts
 different from that in 
2015 Taiwan Kolin
,
 to which intellectual property principles on likelihood of confusion, 
product relatedness, and expansion of business, among others, should be
 applied anew relative to the 
KOLIN
 word mark of KECI. All told, 
res judicata
 - either by "bar by prior judgment" or "conclusiveness of judgment" - does not apply in this case.




With the non-application of 
res judicata
 now having been settled, I express my concurrence with the 
ponencia's
 exhaustive discussion against the registration of KPII's 
kol
i
n
. As the 
ponencia
 amply explained, KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark should not be registered due to the undisputed registration of KECI's 
KOLIN
. Using the 
dominancy test
[31]
 - which is now explicitly incorporated into law under Section 155
[32]
 of Republic Act No. 8293,
[33]
 otherwise known as the "Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines" - KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark is confusingly similar with KECI's 
KOLIN

 mark. Without a doubt, the dominant feature in both marks is the word 
"Kolin" and are in fact, phonetically/aurally the same, hence, resulting
 into the confusion of the product source to the public.




On this score, it should be pointed out that although KECI's 
KOLIN

 covers "automatic voltage regulator, converter, recharger, stereo 
booster, ACÂ­DC regulated power supply, step-down transformer, PA 
amplified AC-DC," the 
potential expansion of business doctrine
 protects KECI's mark equally for the products of "television and DVD players," which KPII's 
kol
i
n
 mark intends to cover in this case. In 
McDonald's Corporation v. L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc.
,
[34]
 this Court held that:


Modern law recognizes that the protection to which the owner
 of a trademark is entitled is not limited to guarding his goods or 
business from actual market competition with identical or similar 
products of the parties, but extends to all cases in which the use by a 
junior appropriator of a tradeÂ­mark or trade-name is likely to lead to a
 confusion of source, as where prospective purchasers would be misled 
into thinking that the complaining party has extended his business into 
the field (see 148 ALR 56 et seq; 53 Am. Jur. 576) or is in any way 
connected with the activities of the infringer; or when it forestalls 
the normal potential expansion of his business (v. 148 ALR 77, 84; 52 
Am. Jur. 576, 577).
[35]




In fine, KPII cannot register for itself a stylized mark which - applying the now prevailing 
dominancy test
 - is confusingly similar to KECI's 
KOLIN
,
 and covers related goods for which the latter word mark was registered 
by KECI. In the end, KECI's word mark should be respected in this case.



Based on the foregoing reasons, the petition should be 
GRANTED
.

 "The Dominancy Test 
focuses on the similarity of the prevalent features of the competing 
trademarks which might cause confusion or deception, and thus 
infringement. If the competing trademark contains the main, essential or
 dominant features of another, and confusion or deception is likely to 
result, infringement takes place. Duplication or imitation is not 
necessary; nor is it necessary that the infringing label should suggest 
an effort to imitate. The question is whether the use of the marks 
involved is likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the 
public or deceive purchasers." (

SECTION 155. 
Remedies; Infringement

155.1. Use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark or the same container 
or a dominant feature thereof

 in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, 
adve1iising of any goods or services including other preparatory steps 
necessary to carry out the sale of any goods or services on or in 
connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause
 mistake, or to deceive; or


155.2. Reproduce, counterfeit, copy or colorably imitate a registered mark 
or a dominant feature thereof

 and apply such reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation 
to labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers, receptacles or 
advertisements intended to be used in commerce upon or in connection 
with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of goods 
or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause 
confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive, shall be liable in a 
civil action for infringement by the registrant for the remedies 
hereinafter set forth: 
Provided
, That the infringement takes 
place at the moment any of the acts stated in Subsection 155.1 or this 
subsection are committed regardless of whether there is actual sale of 
goods or services using the infringing material. (Emphases and 
underscoring supplied)
