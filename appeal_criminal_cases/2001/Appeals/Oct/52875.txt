PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. CONRADO
MERCADO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


This is an automatic review of the
decision of the Regional Trial Court of Agoo, La Union, Branch 32, in Criminal
Case No. A-3314, convicting accused-appellant of rape, and sentencing him to
death and to pay the victim civil indemnity of P50,000.00.
[1]


Accused-appellant was indicted of
rape in an Information which reads:


That on or about the 13
th

day of August, 1997, in the Municipality of Rosario, Province of La Union,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, with lewd design, and being then armed with a knife, by
means of violence and intimidation and by tying the hands and feet of the
aforenamed Melinda P. Mercado, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously have carnal knowledge of her for five times on the aforesaid date,
against her will, to the damage and prejudice of the aforenamed Melinda P.
Mercado, a minor then twelve (12) years of age.


Contrary to law.
[2]


Accused-appellant entered a plea
of âNot Guilty,â
[3]
 after which trial
proceeded.


Twelve-year old Melinda Mercado
spent the afternoon of August 13, 1997 at the house of her cousin, Sonia
Torralba, located in Inabaan Norte, Rosario, La Union.  There she played with Sonia, Larry Torralba,
and her brother, George.  They also cut
bamboo.  At 6:00 in the evening, Melinda
went to the bamboo hut of her uncle, accused-appellant Conrado Mercado, to
return his bolo.  The hut was located
some ten to twelve meters away.  When
Melinda got there, accused-appellant pulled her into the hut, forced her to lie
down on the floor and tied her hands and legs.  Then accused-appellant gagged Melindaâs mouth with a piece of
cloth.  Accused-appellant raised
Melindaâs dress and removed her panties.  He then took off his shorts.  While Melinda was lying on the floor, accused-appellant got hold of a
knife and pointed it at Melindaâs breast.  He then lay down and had sexual intercourse with Melinda.
[4]


Accused-appellant kept Melinda
bound and gagged on the floor of the hut for six hours.  During that span of time, accused-appellant
had sexual intercourse with Melinda five times.  At 12:00 midnight, while accused-appellant was outside the hut,
Melinda was able to untie herself.  She
hurriedly ran out of the hut.  Accused-appellant saw her and ran after her.  Melinda arrived at her house and immediately told her mother that
she had been raped by accused-appellant.  When her mother saw the latter arriving, she threw a plastic container
at him.
[5]


The following morning, Melindaâs
mother brought her to the house of Barangay Captain Rodrigo Molina to report
the matter.  The Barangay Captain
summoned Councilman Jose Laroya to fetch accused-appellant.  Later, Melinda was brought to the Rosario
District Hospital for medical examination.
[6]
 Then, she was brought to
the police station, where she gave her statement regarding the rape.
[7]
 Thereafter, she was brought
to the Ilocos Regional Hospital for further medical examination.
[8]


Melindaâs cousin, Larry Torralba,
also twelve years old, saw accused-appellant pull Melinda into the hut from his
house.  He and Melindaâs brother,
George, approached the hut and peeped through a hole in the wall.  He saw accused-appellant force Melinda to
lie down on the floor, gag her mouth and tie her hands and feet.  After that, he and George ran towards his
house and reported what they saw to his brother.
[9]


Dr. Rosemarie Catapang, who
examined Melinda at the Ilocos Regional Hospital on August 14, 1997, found
incomplete healed lacerations on her genitals at 5:00 oâclock and 3:00 oâclock
positions.
[10]


SPO2 Rodolfo Abella and SPO1
Dominador Gali of the Rosario Police were dispatched to the crime scene on
August 15, 1997 to gather physical evidence.
[11]
 They were able to recover
from accused-appellantâs hut, the white t-shirt which he tied around Melindaâs
mouth,
[12]
 Melindaâs panties,
[13]
 the kitchen knife which
accused-appellant pointed at Melinda,
[14]
 and the nylon rope used to
tie Melindaâs hands and legs.
[15]


On August 15, 1997, Melinda filed
a formal complaint for rape against accused-appellant with the Municipal Trial
Court of Rosario, La Union.
[16]
 After finding a 
prima
facie
 case against accused-appellant, Municipal Trial Judge Caroline B.
PaÃ±gan forwarded the records of the case to the Provincial Prosecutor of La
Union.
[17]
 On September 16, 1997, the
Information quoted above was filed with the Regional Trial Court of Agoo, La
Union, and docketed as Criminal Case No. A-3314.
[18]


The defense relied on the lone
testimony of accused-appellant.  According to him, he was at Linapew, Tubao, La Union in the morning of
August 13, 1997, which was three kilometers away, or about twenty minutes walk
from his house in Inabaan Norte, Rosario, La Union.  He went there to cut weeds at the field of his cousin, Leonardo
Laroya.  He finished at 5:00 oâclock in
the afternoon, after which he drank gin with Laroya.  At 7:00 p.m., he walked home.  He arrived at his house at past 8:00 p.m.
[19]


Accused-appellant denied the
accusation of rape against him.  When
asked if he knew of any reason why complainant would impute such charges on
him, accused-appellant surmised that his brother, Ernesto Mercado, who is
Melindaâs father, wanted to take away the land where he was staying.
[20]


On February 23, 1999, the trial
court rendered the decision subject hereof, the dispositive portion of which
reads:


WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, the accused
Conrado Mercado is hereby found âGUILTYâ of the crime charged and is hereby
sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty of Death by lethal injection; to
indemnify the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 for the rape and to pay the
cost of the proceedings.


SO ORDERED.
[21]


Accused-appellantâs Brief before
this Court raises only one assignment of error, to wit:


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING THE DEATH
PENALTY ON THE ACCUSED BECAUSE THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE ACCUSED WAS
A RELATIVE WITHIN THE THIRD DEGREE OF CONSANGUINITY OF THE VICTIM WAS NOT
ALLEGED IN THE INFORMATION.
[22]


In other words, accused-appellant
does not question his conviction or the findings of the trial court as to his
guilt.  He merely prays that the penalty
imposed on him be modified to 
reclusion perpetua
,
[23]
 which prayer is joined by
the Solicitor General.
[24]


Accused-appellantâs position is
well-taken.  The trial courtâs
imposition of the death penalty was based on Article 335 (now Article 266-B) of
the Revised Penal Code, 
viz:


The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is
committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:


1.
  
when the victim is under
eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent,
guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree,
or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.  xxx.


In quite a number of cases, we
have consistently ruled that for death to be imposable under the above
provision, both the minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender
should be specifically alleged in the Information.  It is not enough that the relationship was subsequently proved
during the trial.  Otherwise,
accused-appellant can only be convicted of simple rape, the penalty for which
is 
reclusion perpetua
.
[25]


The informations merely allege the minority of complainant.  However, an allegation of her filial
relationship with accused-appellant is essential because these two (minority
and relationship) constitute a special qualifying circumstance, which, in
accordance with the settled rule, must be alleged in the information and
proven.  Thus, in 
People v. Garcia 
(281
SCRA 463 [1997]), it was held that qualifying circumstances, which increase the
penalty by degree rather than merely affect the period of penalty as in the
case of aggravating circumstances, must be properly pleaded in the information
consistent with the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the
charges against him.  Consequently, there
would be a denial of due process if after being charged with simple rape, he is
convicted of its qualified form punishable with death.  In these cases, the attendant circumstance
qualifying the offense was not completely alleged in the indictments on which
he was arraigned.  For this reason, the
death penalty imposed on accused-appellant in each case should be reduced to 
reclusion
perpetua
.
[26]


This case may easily be disposed
of by a simple modification of the penalty as prayed for by accused-appellant.   If we do that, however, we would be shirking
from our legally mandated duty to review all death penalty cases.
[27]
 This duty has been
eloquently summed up by Mr. Justice Puno in this wise:


We hold, however, that there is more wisdom in our existing
jurisprudence mandating our review of 
all
 death penalty cases,
regardless of the wish of the convict and regardless of the will of the
court.  
Nothing less than life is at
stake and any court decision authorizing the State to take life must be as
error-free as possible.
  We must
strive to realize this objective, however elusive it may be, and our efforts
must not depend on whether appellant has withdrawn his appeal or has
escaped.  Indeed, an appellant may
withdraw his appeal not because he is guilty but because of his wrong
perception of the law.  Or because he
may want to avail of the more speedy remedy of pardon.  Or because of his frustration and
misapprehension that he will not get justice from the authorities.  Nor should the Court be influenced by the
seeming repudiation of its jurisdiction when a convict escapes.  Ours is not only the power but the duty to
review all death penalty cases.  
No
litigant can repudiate this power which is bestowed by the Constitution.  The power is more of a sacred duty which we
have to discharge to assure the People that the innocence of a citizen is our
concern not only in crimes that slight but even more, in crimes that shock the
conscience.  This concern cannot be
diluted.
[28]


Thus, we painstakingly sifted
through the evidence presented in order to make our own determination as to
accused-appellantâs guilt or innocence.  We have reached the conclusion that the prosecution sufficiently proved
accused-appellantâs guilt beyond reasonable doubt.


Notably, the victim, Melinda
Mercado, testified in a categorical, straightforward, spontaneous and frank
manner, and remained consistent even on cross-examination.  Moreover, her testimony was natural and
consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.  A rape victim who testifies in a
categorical, straightforward, spontaneous and frank manner, and remains
consistent, is a credible witness.
[29]


Furthermore, an eyewitness
testified as to accused-appellantâs acts leading to the rape of the
victim.  It is axiomatic that the lone
testimony of the rape victim, if credible, is sufficient to support a
conviction.
[30]
 With more reason, her
testimony would suffice where it is corroborated by other evidence in its
material points.  Although, admittedly,
Larry Torralba did not witness the actual rape, his testimony constitutes
circumstantial proof which, taken together with other evidence, more
specifically, the discovery of the articles of clothing and rope inside
accused-appellantâs hut, tends to prove the commission of the crime.


xxx.  Conviction for rape
may be based on circumstantial evidence when the victim cannot testify on the
actual commission of the rape as she was rendered unconscious when the act was
committed, provided that more than one circumstance is duly proved and that the
totality or the unbroken chain of the circumstances proven lead to no other
logical conclusion than the appellantâs guilt of the crime charged.  xxx.
[31]


In the face of the victimâs clear
and positive account of the commission of the crime, accused-appellant can only
offer the defense of denial and alibi.  Unfortunately, the place where accused-appellant allegedly was at the
time of the rape was only three kilometers away, and can be traversed by foot
within twenty minutes.  For the defense
of alibi to prosper, accused-appellant must not only prove his presence at
another place at the time of the commission of the offense, but he must also
demonstrate that it would be physically impossible for him to be at the 
locus
criminis
 at the time of the commission of the crime.
[32]


Alibi and denial are inherently weak defenses and unless supported
by clear and convincing evidence, the same can not prevail over the positive
declarations of the victim who, in a simple and straightforward manner,
convincingly identified the accused-appellant as the defiler of her
chastity.  In short, the positive
assertions of accused-appellantâs daughter that he raped her is entitled to
greater weight.  While denial and alibi
are legitimate defenses in rape cases, bare assertions to this effect can not
overcome the categorical testimony of the victim.
[33]


Coming now to the civil damages,
the victim should be awarded moral damages in addition to the civil indemnity
imposed by the trial court.  Moral
damages in the amount of P50,000.00 are awarded to victims of simple rape,
without need for pleading or proof of the basis thereof.  The fact that the complainant in rape has
suffered the trauma of mental physical and psychological sufferings which
constitute the basis for moral damages are too obvious to still require recital
thereof at the trial by the victim since we assume and acknowledge such agony
on her part as a gauge of her credibility.
[34]
 In the case at bar, there
was proof that Melinda suffered mental anguish, and that she had to stop going
to school out of sheer embarrassment and shame for her misfortune.
[35]


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the Decision of the
Regional Trial Court of Agoo, La Union, Branch 32, in Criminal Case No. A-3314,
finding accused-appellant Conrado Mercado guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of rape, is AFFIRMED
 
with
 
MODIFICATION.  As modified, accused-appellant is sentenced
to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua,
 and to pay the victim,
Melinda Mercado, the additional amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages.
