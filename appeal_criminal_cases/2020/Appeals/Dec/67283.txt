PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROGER PADIN Y TILAR, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




DELOS SANTOS, J.:


This is an appeal filed by Roger Padin 
y
 Tilar (accused-appellant) from the Decision
[1]
 dated February 21, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 10101 denying the appeal from the Decision
[2]
 dated October 27, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of 
xxxxxxxxxxx
 Branch 42, finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape. 

Facts


In an 
Information
[3]
 
dated July 27, 2012, accused-appellant was charged with the crime of 
Rape, defmed and penalized under paragraph 1 of Articles 266-A and 266-B
 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended, in relation to Republic 
Act No. (RA) 7610,
[4]
 against AAA,
[5]
 committed as follows:


That on or about the 4
th
 day of APRIL 2012 in the evening 
xxxxxxxxxxx

 at province of Catanduanes, and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above[-]named accused, by means of force, threat 
and intimidation, with lewd design, did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously, lie and have carnal knowledge of [AAA,] a 
child twelve (12) years of age, without her consent, which said acts 
debased, degraded or demeaned the intrinsic worth and dignity of said 
child victim as a human being, to her damage and prejudice.



CONTRARY TO LAW.
[6]


The case was initially archived on April 5, 2013, and was revived on 
March 17, 2014, after accused-appellant's apprehension. Upon arraignment
 on March 28, 2014, accused-appellant entered a plea of not guilty to 
the charge. After the pre-trial conference, trial on the merits ensued.
[7]
 


According to the prosecution, AAA was born on September 20, 1999. 
Accused-appellant was the live-in partner of BBB, AAA's mother, whom AAA
 called "Daddy." AAA sleeps in one room with her other siblings while 
accused-appellant and BBB, along with her youngest child, sleep in 
another room.
[8]


 On the evening of April 4, 2012, BBB was in 
xxxxxxxxxxx

 Catanduanes where she worked as a household helper. AAA, then 12 years 
old, was awakened when accused-appellant, who was then half-naked, 
removed her shorts and underwear and immediately laid on top of her. 
Accused-appellant inserted his finger into her vagina. Shortly 
thereafter, he removed his finger and replaced it with his penis, doing a
 "push-and-pull" movement. Out of fear, AAAjust cried and did not resist
 nor shout for help. After raping AAA, accused-appellant removed his 
penis and without any word, left the room.
[9]


 While at work, BBB received a text message from an unknown sender, which reads: "
Gud pm. Nag alala lang ako kung pwede subaybayan mo ang asawa mo, kasi inaabusa ang anak rna nasi

 [AAA]." Thus, BBB rushed home to talk to AAA regarding the text 
message. Upon arrival at home, BBB summoned AAA and showed her the text 
message. It was only then that AAA divulged to her mother the repeated 
sexual abuses of accusedÂ­ appellant.
[10]


 Two (2) days after, BBB went to the Barangay to seek advice and per 
recommendation, AAA was brought to Eastern Bicol Medical Center on April
 9, 2012, at 6 o'clock in the morning, where she was examined by Dr. 
Monisita Genogaling-Lacorte (Dr. Lacorte), Medical Officer IV. The 
Medico-Legal Certificate
[11]
 
declared that AAA had: 1) an abrasion on the lower part of the labia 
minora (left) 0.5 em x 0.5 em; 2) lacerated wound 0.5 em on the 
fourchette (left) at 5 o'clock position; and 3) ruptured hymen (admits 2
 fingers). In sum, the findings were suggestive of penetration force to 
the hymen brought about by a firm object or penis.
[12]


 When informed of the result, BBB and AAA reported the incident to 
xxxxxxxxxxx

 Municipal Police Station. They executed their sworn statements which 
detailed the incident and thereafter filed a complaint against 
accusedÂ­appellant.
[13]
 


In his defense, accused-appellant vehemently denied the charge 
against him. He claimed that in the morning of April4, 2012, he just 
arrived from detention, brought about by another case for physical 
injuries filed against him by Nomeriano Oturdo (Oturdo). When he arrived
 home, he inquired from AAA about BBB's whereabouts. AAA initially 
disclaimed knowing where BBB was and AAA was chastised by 
accused-appellant. AAA eventually told him that BBB was with Oturdo. 
Accused-appellant then called BBB and told her to go home. When BBB 
arrived, accusedÂ­ appellant confronted her about what he heard from AAA 
which caused them to argue. That night, after BBB and accused-appellant 
reconciled, accusedÂ­appellant slept beside BBB while the children slept 
on BBB's other side, with AAA who was farthest from accused-appellant.
[14]


 The next day, BBB brought along AAA, hoping that her employer would 
allow AAA to replace her. Apparently, BBB took the opportunity to have 
AAA undergo medical examination and subsequently have accusedÂ­appellant 
arrested.
[15]


 CCC, AAA's younger brother, alleged that he never saw 
accusedÂ­appellant abuse AAA. He claimed that it was Oturdo, rather than 
accusedÂ­ appellant, who raped AAA.
[16]




RTC Ruling


The RTC found no iota of doubt in AAA's testimony that accusedÂ­ 
appellant raped her, not only once, but several times, although she 
could no longer remember the dates, except the latest incident which 
came to the knowledge of her mother. It considered AAA a credible 
witness as she was able to narrate, in a clear and straightforward 
manner, how she was raped by accused-appellant. It gave no weight to the
 testimony of CCC as his statement that accused-appellant was with him 
in the mountain on April 4, 2012 was refuted by accused-appellant 
himself who categorically declared that on said date, he slept with his 
live-in partner, BBB, their children, and AAA.
[17]
 Hence, the RTC disposed of the case as follows:


WHEREFORE
, this Court finds ROGER PADIN y TILAR 
GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of RAPE committed against AAA and is, 
hereby, sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua without 
eligibility for parole and to pay AAA the amounts of SEVENTY-FIVE 
THOUSAND PESOS (Php75,000.00), as civil indemnity, SEVENTYÂ­FIVE THOUSAND
 PESOS (Php75,000.00), as moral damages and SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND PESOS 
(Php75,000.00), as exemplary damages, which shall be subject to legal 
interest at the rate of six percent (6%) 
per annum
 from the date of finality of judgment until fully paid. 


SO ORDERED.
[18]


Aggrieved, accused-appellant appealed before the CA. 


CA Ruling


The CA denied the appeal for lack of merit.

The CA gave full faith and credit to AAA's positive identification of 
accused-appellant as her attacker which remained consistent on 
crossÂ­examination. It noted the proximity as accused-appellant was 
already on top of AAA when she was awakened, coupled with the fact that 
she knew accused-appellant well, being the live-in partner of her 
mother, enabled AAA to easily recognize him. Moreover, the CA added that
 AAA's public outcry of 
violacion de una mujer
 was fortified by the medical findings of Dr. Lacorte. Citing 
People v. Manigo
,
[19]

 the CA stated that it is also hornbook precept that where a victim's 
testimony is corroborated by the physical findings of penetration, there
 is sufficient basis for concluding that sexual intercourse did take 
place
[20]
 The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:


WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the 
APPEAL is DENIED
 for lack of merit. 


SO ORDERED
.
[21]


Hence, this appeal, with accused-appellant assailing the said CA Decision. In compliance with the Court's Resolution
[22]
 dated February 12, 2020, requiring the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs, both accused-appellant
[23]
 and the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG)
[24]
 manifested that in lieu of supplemental briefs, they were adopting their respective briefs filed before the CA. 


Issue


The issue for the Court's resolution is whether the CA's Decision is contrary to facts, law, and jurisprudence.


The Court's Ruling


The appeal lacks merit.

Article 266-A of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353,
[25]
 or the AntiÂ­ Rape Law of 1997, provides the elements for the crime of rape:


Art. 266-A. 
Rape; When and how committed
.-Rape is committedâ


1) By a man who shall have 
carnal knowledge of a woman
 under any of the following circumstances: 


 
 
 
a) 
 
Through force,
 threat, or intimidation;
 
 
 
 
b)
 
  When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
 
 
 
c) 
 
By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and
 
 
 
d)
 
 
When
 the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, 
even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present. 
 
 
 

(Emphases supplied)


In this case, all the elements necessary to sustain a conviction for 
simple rape are present: (1) that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge
 of AAA; and (2) that said act was accomplished through the use of force
 or intimidation.
[26]
 It was 
sufficiently established by the testimony of AAA that there was carnal 
knowledge between her and accused-appellant. This was corroborated by 
the medical findings of Dr. Lacorte which showed vaginal lacerations. 
Regarding the element of force or intimidation, or exertion of moral 
ascendancy, the RTC aptly concluded that although the rape was committed
 without physical force or intimidation, the moral ascendancy of 
accused-appellant over AAA renders it unnecessary to prove force or 
intimidation. It is settled that where the rape is committed by a close 
kin, such as the victim's father, stepfather, uncle, or the common-law 
spouse of her mother, it is not necessary that actual force or 
intimidation be employed; moral influence or ascendancy takes the place 
of violence or intimidation.
[27]
 


Accused-appellant argued that AAA's testimony was tainted with 
illogical details which were contrary to human experience. Specifically,
 accused-appellant harped on the presence of AAA's other siblings who 
were sleeping beside her in the same small room, and that her siblings 
continued sleeping soundly and failed to notice her cries during the 
alleged sexual abuse. This is a weak argun1ent that deserves scant 
consideration. As correctly pointed out by the CA, thus: 


However, as repeatedly underscored in the forensic canvass, 
lust is no respecter of time and place. Neither the crampness of the 
room, the presence of other people therein, nor the high risk of being 
caught, has been held sufficient and effective obstacles to deter the 
commission of rape. Isolation is not a determinative factor to rule on 
whether a rape was committed or not and there is no rule that a woman 
can only be raped in seclusion. It can be committed, discreetly or 
indiscreetly, even in a room full of family members sleeping side by 
side.
[28]
 Withal, it was not 
wellÂ­

nigh unthinkable for the members of the victim's family to be in deep 
slumber and not to be awakened while a sexual assault is being 
committed.
[29]


Likewise, accused-appellant's argument that AAA was only persuaded by 
ill-motive to file the case as an act of revenge against him because he 
castigated her on the day of the alleged incident, must be rejected. As 
correctly opined by the CA, it was indeed highly improbable for a girl 
of tender years and not yet exposed to the ways of the world, like AAA, 
to impute a crime as serious as rape if the crime had not really been 
committed.
[30]


In 
People v. Rubio
,
[31]
 the Court explained:


This Court has held time and again that testimonies of rape 
victims who are yonng and immature deserve full credence, considering 
that no yonng woman, especially of tender age, would concoct a story of 
defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and thereafter 
pervert herself by being subject to a public trial, if she was not 
motivated solely by the desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed
 against her. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth. It is 
highly improbable that a girl of tender years, one not yet exposed to 
the ways of the world, would impute to any man a crime so serious as 
rape if what she claims is not true.
[32]


On accused-appellant's claim that the trial court should have dismissed 
the case considering that AAA executed an Affidavit of Desistance
[33]

 which exonerated him from the charge, it is worthy to note that AAA's 
affidavit of desistance is not a ground for the dismissal of the case. 
As discussed in 
People v. Bagsic
:
[34]



Rape is no longer considered a private crime as R.A No. 8353 or the 
AntiÂ­ Rape Law of 1997 has reclassified rape as a crime against persons.
 Rape may now be prosecuted de officio; a complaint for rape commenced 
by the offended party is no longer necessary for its prosecution. Hence,
 an affidavit of desistance, which may be considered as pardon by the 
complaining witness, is not by itself a gronnd for the dismissal of a 
rape action over which the court has already assumed jurisdiction.
[35]
 (Citations omitted)


Moreover, it has been consistently held that courts look with disfavor on affidavits of desistance. In 
Bagsic
, the Court had an occasion to discuss the rationale for this:


We have said in so many cases that retractions are 
generally unreliable and are looked upon with considerable disfavor by 
the courts. The unreliable character of this document is shown by the 
fact that it is quite incredible that after going through the process of
 having the [appellant] arrested by the police, positively identifYing 
him as the person who raped her, enduring the humiliation of a physical 
examination of her private parts, and then repeating her accusations in 
open court by recounting her anguish, [the rape victim] would suddenly 
turn around and declare that [a]fter a careful deliberation over the 
case, (she) find(s) that the same does not merit or warrant criminal 
prosecution.



Thus, we have declared that at most the retraction is an afterthought
 which should not be given probative value. It would be a dangerous rule
 to reject the testimony taken before the court of justice simply 
because the witness who gave it later on changed [her] mind for one 
reason or another. Such a rule [would] make a solemn trial a mockery and
 place the investigation at the mercy of unscrupulous witnesses.
[36]


In this case, AAA's purported affidavit of desistance should be regarded
 as exceedingly unreliable more so, as aptly observed by the CA, that 
AAA testified that its execution was borne out of sheer commiseration 
for her siblings, and such justification can hardly affect the 
established fact that accused-appellant sexually abused her.

On accused-appellant's testimony on denial, a defense of denial and 
alibi cannot stand against the prosecution's evidence. As expounded by 
the Court in 
People v. Carillo
:
[37]


Alibi is an inherently weak defense because it is easy to 
fabricate and highly unreliable. To merit approbation, [he] must adduce 
clear and convincing evidence that [he was] in a place other than the 
situs criminis at the time when the crime was committed, such that it 
was physically impossible for [him] to have been at the scene of the 
crime when it was committed.
[38]


Accused-appellant failed in this regard. Besides, as correctly noted by 
the OSG, accused-appellant's denial and alibi belied his own testimony 
and that of his lone witness, CCC.

Indeed, the RTC did not err in giving full faith to AAA's credibility. 
In 
Carillo
, the Court held that:


As a general rule, on the question [of] whether to believe 
the version of the prosecution or that of the defense, the trial court's
 choice is generally viewed as correct and entitled to the highest 
respect because it is more competent to conclude so, having had the 
opportunity to observe the witnesses' demeanor and deportment on the 
witness stand as they gave their testimonies. The trial court is, thus, 
in the best position to weigh conflicting testimonies and to discern if 
the witnesses were telling the truth. Without any clear showing that the
 trial court and the appellate court overlooked, misunderstood or 
misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance, the rule
 should not be disturbed.
[39]


Here, the Court fmds no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the 
RTC, as correctly sustained by the CA, for accused-appellant's 
conviction of rape.


 The Court notes, however, that the CA failed to pass upon and 
discuss the penalty imposed by the RTC. Thus, the Court deems it apt to 
re-examine the same.


 Article 266-B provides for the penalties for rape, thus:


Article 266-B. 
Penalties
. - Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.

x x x x

The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is 
committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying 
circumstances:

1) When the 
victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent
, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the 
common-law spouse of the parent of the victi
m[.] (Emphases supplied)


The Court explained in 
People v. Arcillas
:
[40]


Rape is qualified and punished with death when committed by 
the victim's parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, or relative by 
consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or by the 
commonÂ­law spouse of the victim's parent. However, an accused carmot be 
found guilty of qualified rape unless the information alleges the 
circumstances of the victim's over 12 years but under 18 years of age 
and her relationship with him. The reason is that such circumstances 
alter the nature of the crime of rape and increase the penalty; hence, 
they are special qualifYing circumstances. As such, both the age of the 
victim and her relationship with the offender must be specifically 
alleged in the information and proven beyond reasonable doubt during the
 trial; otherwise, the death penalty carmot be imposed.
[41]
 (Citations omitted)


In other words, to justify the imposition of the death penalty under 
the aforequoted provision, the twin circumstances of minority and 
relationship must be alleged in the 
Information
 and proved during the trial.
[42]


In this case, AAA's minority was alleged in the 
Information
 
and proven by the prosecution's documentary evidence that she was born 
on September 20, 1999. She was under the age of 18 when she was sexually
 abused by accused-appellant in 2012. Her relationship with the accusedÂ­
 appellant, however, as properly observed by the RTC, was not specified 
in the 
Information
.


 The Court ruled in 
People v. Lapore
:
[43]


Sections 8 and 9 of Rule 110 of the Rules on Criminal 
Procedure provide that for qualifying and aggravating circumstances to 
be appreciated, it must be alleged in the complaint or information. This
 is in line with the constitutional right of an accused to be informed 
of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. Even if the 
prosecution has duly proven the presence of the circumstances, the Court
 cannot appreciate the same if they were not alleged in the Information.
[44]


Hence, although the prosecution has duly established that 
accusedÂ­appellant is the common-law spouse of BBB, AAA's mother, which, 
however, was not alleged in the 
Information
, such circumstance 
could not be appreciated to qualify a crime from simple rape to 
qualified rape as defined under Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended. 
Thus, although AAA's minority went uncontroverted, the element of 
relationship was not competently established.


 As a consequence, accused-appellant committed only simple rape, thus
 precluding the application of RA 9346.45 Pursuant to Article 266-A of 
the RPC, the proper penalty is 
reclusion perpetua
. Although the RTC correctly sentenced accused-appellant to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, it, however, confusingly appended the phrase "without eligibility for parole" to 
reclusion perpetua
.
 It should be stressed that the qualification of "without eligibility 
for parole" is material to qualify reclusion perpetua in order to 
emphasize that the appellant should have been sentenced to suffer the 
death penalty had it not been for RA 9346. Here, to reiterate, the death
 penalty is not warranted, the crime committed being only simple rape. 
Hence, there is no need to use and affix the phrase "without eligibility
 for parole" to qualify the penalty of reclusion perpetua; it is 
understood that convicted person penalized with an indivisible penalty 
is not eligible for parole.
[46]
 Accordingly, the phrase "without eligibility for parole" should be deleted to prevent confusion.


Finally, as to the RTC's award of damages, the Court finds the same 
appropriate under the circumstances. Civil indemnity is mandatory upon 
the finding of the fact of rape, while moral damages are proper without 
need of proof other than the fact of rape by virtue of the undeniable 
moral suffering of the victim due to the rape. Under Article 2230 of the
 Civil Code, exemplary damages may be imposed in criminal cases as part 
of the civil liability when the crime was committed with one or more 
aggravating circumstances. Article 2229 of the same Code permits such 
damages to be awarded "by way of example or correction for the public 
good, in addition to the moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory 
damages."
[47]
 As to the amount, 
People v. Jugueta
[48]
 provides that when the crime committed is simple rape which calls for the imposition of 
reclusion perpetua

 only, as in this case, the proper amounts should be P75,000.00 as civil
 indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 exemplary 
damages, regardless of the number of qualifying aggravating 
circumstances present. The RTC was, therefore, correct in ordering 
accused-appellant to pay AAA P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 
as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages.


Similarly, the RTC properly imposed interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum

 on the monetary awards reckoned from the finality of the decision to 
complete the quest for justice and vindication on the part of AAA. This 
is pursuant to Article 2211 of the Civil Code, which states that in 
crimes and quasi-delicts, interest as a part of the damages may, in a 
proper case, be adjudicated in the discretion of the court.
[49]


WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
DISMISSED
. The Court finds Roger Padin 
y
 Tilar 
GUILTY

 beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape as defined and penalized 
under Article 266-A, par. l, in relation to Art. 266-B, par. (1) of the 
Revised Penal Code, as amended, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the 
penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, and ordered to pay the victim AAA 
P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and 
P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, with all such amounts to earn interest 
of six percent (6%) per annum from date of finality of this Decision 
until fully paid.
