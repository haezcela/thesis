LEONARDO-DE CASTRO, J.:


For review is the 
Decision
[1]
 dated February 28, 2005 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 00634 which affirmed
 
the 
Consolidated Decision
[2]
 dated July 28, 2000 of Branch 272, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Marikina City, convicting accused-appellant Jaime Cadag Jimenez of two counts of the crime of Rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and ordering him to pay the victim the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and another P50,000.00 as moral damages on each count.
Consistent with our ruling in 
People v. Cabalquinto
[3]
 and 
People v. Guillermo
,
[4]
 
this Court withholds the real name of the private complainant and her immediate family members as well as such other personal circumstance or information tending to establish her identity.  The initials AAA would represent the private complainant and the initials BBB would refer to the mother of the private complainant.
To quote, the pertinent portions of the criminal information in each case:

Accused-appellant Jimenez pleaded not guilty upon arraignment.
[5]
  The pre-trial conference followed and, thereafter, trial ensued.
The prosecution presented the testimonies of AAA,
[6]
 Dr. Dennis Bellin
[7]
 (the medico-legal officer who physically examined the complainant), SPO1 Lucy Mae Robles
[8]
 (the police officer who initially conducted the investigation), and Rowena Villegas
[9]
 (the social worker who responded to the aid of AAA). The documentary evidence for the prosecution consisted of the Medico-Legal Report No. M-833-97 of Dr. Dennis Bellin,
[10]
 the 
Voluntary Statements
 executed by AAA on February 27, 1998 before SPO1 Lucy Mae Robles,
[11]
 and the Certificate of Live Birth of AAA.
[12]
  The defense, on the other hand, presented the testimonies of BBB
[13]
 and that of the accused-appellant.
[14]
After trial, the RTC convicted the accused-appellant.  The trial court found that the accused-appellant was the biological father of AAA and he started raping his own daughter when she was only eleven (11) years old.  However, the accused-appellant was only held criminally liable for two counts of 
simple
 rape in view of the failure of the prosecution to allege in the informations the qualifying circumstance of relationship of the accused-appellant with AAA
.
This case was directly appealed to this Court.  The accused-appellant filed his 
Brief
[15]
 
dated February 12, 2002 and 
Reply Brief
[16]
 dated November 7, 2002 while the plaintiff-appellee filed its 
Brief
[17]
 
dated June 18, 2002.  In a 
Minute Resolution
[18]
 
dated August 25, 2004, we referred this case to the CA for appropriate action conformably with our ruling in 
People v. Mateo
.
[19]
In its assailed decision, the CA recapitulated the evidence for the prosecution as follows:
The testimony of complainant 
AAA
 was synthesized by the trial court as follows:
On direct examination, the witness testified:
That on August 1996, she was 11 years old, that Jaime Jimenez is her father (at this juncture, the witness positively identified the accused, Jaime Jimenez in the courtroom); that her father raped her during the month of August 1996; that her father crawled on top of her and did what a husband does to his wife "na nakapatong" according to the herein witness, that it was the accused, Jaime Jimenez who did it to her; that said incident took place in their own house at ... Marikina; that their house is a one-storey apartment; that they are five children in the family; that the name of her mother is BBB; that there is only one room in their house; that during the month of August 1996, they slept in the living room with her mother; that sometimes her father sleeps in the sala or in the room; that she could no longer remember what time in the evening the alleged rape incident happened; that one night in August 1996, her father touched her body and her breast and afterwards, undressed her; that the incident happened while her mother and siblings were sleeping; that the said incident happened inside their room; that she did not do anything because of fear; that her father after undressing her laid on top of her and started kissing her (the witness at this very moment was on the verge of crying); that according to the herein witness, she filed the case voluntarily and she knows that the person she is charging for rape is her own father; that after he father went on top of her, the former inserted his penis into her vagina; that the insertion of the penis into her vagina was so painful; that she did not tell her father anything since she was afraid that he might kill her; that the same incident happened around 5 to 6; that her father abused her again on November 1996 when she already had her period; that after her period, her father inserted again his finger into her vagina; that she cannot remember anymore how many times her father inserted his finger but she remembers that the last time her father inserted his finger into her vagina was around February of 1997; that she reported the incident of rape and act [of] lasciviousness to her classmate and to her religion teacher; that she could no longer remember how old was her classmate then; that she did not report the incident to her mother because of fear; that she finally gave her statement to the police sometime in February; that the said investigation (her statement) was reduced into writing and was signed by her (at this juncture, the herein victim witness identified said document in the court); that she was born on January 25, 1985 (at this point again, the witness identified and recognized her birth certificate when shown to her by her counsel); that she could still remember having been examined by the doctor of the PNP Crime Laboratory; that it was the social worker of Bantay-Bata who got hold of the medico legal certificate (at this point, the witness identified the said document in open court).
On cross-examination, the witness further alleged:
That she is now in Marilac Hills, that she is not living with her mother at present because the latter is telling her to withdraw the case against her father; that she really wanted to file this case against her father; that before she did not want his father to be incarcerated; that nobody convinced her to file this case and let her father be incarcerated; that she does not know if she wants her father to be put to death; that she could no longer recall of the incident that happened in August is the same thing that his father inserted his finger into her private part; that what she could only remember was that the last time she was abused by her father was on February of 1997; that she knew that it was her father's penis which was inserted into her vagina because she was able to feel it; that the first time she has experience in sexual intercourse, as far as she can remember was in August of 1996 which was the very same incident that brought her to his court; that she was sure that his father's penis which was inserted into her vagina since her father even asked her to hold it but she refused in doing so; that the latest incident of sexual abuse was sometime in February 1997 when her father inserted his finger into her vagina; that that was the only time she filed this complaint."
Rowena Villegas
 said she is [a] social worker connected with ABS-CBN Foundation Bantay Bata 163 which initially took custody of AAA and assisted throughout the investigation and filing of this case.  It was on February 28, 1997 when she was instructed by her immediate supervisor to bring her to the police station where she was investigated.  On March 1, 1997 she accompanied AAA to the prosecutor's office for inquest which was conducted in the presence of her mother and [accused-appellant] himself.  Though she asserted that she was raped by him, she cried and asked that her father be released.
SPO1 Lucy Mae Robles
 testified on the procedure and taking of the statement of AAA on February 28, 1997 on referral by Bantay Bata 163. Later she also took the statement of her mother BBB, and on her invitation [accused-appellant] was present at the investigation.
Dr. Dennis Bellin
 narrated that on February 28, 1997 he received a request from the Marikina police to conduct a medico legal examination on AAA who was there in the company of her mother.  With their consent, he conducted an interview and the requested examination. AAA said she was sexually abused by her father on August 26, 1996, and he proceeded with his physical examination the findings and results of which are contained in his Medico Legal Report No. M-833-97 as follows:

TIME AND DATE COMPLETED: 1045h, 28 February 1997.
[20]
The evidence for the defense, on the other hand, was summarized as follows:
BBB
 said that she knew and suspected nothing of the supposed rape until the teacher of AAA summoned her on February 27, 1997.  AAA never complained to her about it and there was nothing out of the ordinary in her behaviour nor that of the accused-appellant.  She was always home early, and the whole family slept together on the floor in their small sala.
The 
accused-appellant
 for his part denied that he ever raped AAA and that she charged him only because his wife BBB taught her to.  At the time when the alleged rapes were supposed to have happened he was at work as a steelman at the Petron Mega Plaza. He could prove this by his daily time record, but which he could not produce because his wife did not get it as asked and his letter requests to the company have been unanswered.  He could not go and get it himself as he is already detained in the national penitentiary because he has been convicted for child abuse in another case filed by AAA.
[21]
The CA rejected the contention of the accused-appellant that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged and affirmed his convictions. The appellate court denied the motion for reconsideration of the accused-appellant in a 
Resolution
[22]
 
dated April 5, 2005.  Thereafter, the case was elevated to this Court.
In a 
Minute Resolution
[23]
 
dated April 26, 2006, we gave the parties the option to file their respective supplemental briefs within a definite period.  Subsequently, the accused-appellant filed his 
Supplemental Brief
[24]
 
dated May 29, 2006 while the plaintiff-appellee manifested
[25]
 that it will no longer file any supplemental brief.
In the present appeal, the accused-appellant asserts that the prosecution failed to establish the exact dates of the commission of the crimes charged and that the failure of AAA to recall these dates with certainty likewise clouds the veracity of her testimony.  He points out that the criminal informations allege that the rape incidents occurred on or about August 8, 1996 and the last week of October 1996 but AAA merely testified that she was raped 5 to 6 times sometime in August to October 1996.  The accused-appellant also claims that AAA's reactions after the alleged rape incidents are suspicious and contrary to human experience.  He points out that AAA first related her accusations to her classmate and teacher in school without satisfactorily explaining the reason why she failed to talk about it with her mother or report the same to the police at the most opportune time.  He further points out that AAA testified that she was raped in the room of their house at a time when her mother and four siblings were sleeping in the same room. Under such a scenario, it was allegedly implausible that none of the said family members woke from their sleep during the times the accused-appellant purportedly raped AAA.
On the other hand, the plaintiff-appellee, through the Solicitor General, contends that AAA sufficiently narrated in court the material details on how, when, and where she was raped by her father.  The exact dates of the commission of the crimes charged are allegedly not necessary to convict the accused-appellant.  The plaintiff-appellee argues that it suffices that the months and year of the rape incidents and sexual assaults had been established as alleged.
The plaintiff-appellee further points out that the trial court failed to award exemplary damages in favor of AAA in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.  Thus, the plaintiff-appellee prays for an additional amount of twenty-five thousand pesos (P25,000.00) in favor of AAA to set an example and deter fathers from sexually abusing their own daughters.
After a careful consideration of the issues raised in this appeal and the evidence on record, we affirm the conviction of the accused-appellant of the crimes charged and grant the exemplary damages prayed in favor of AAA.
It is elementary that the issue of credibility of witnesses is "a question best addressed to the province of the trial court because of its unique position of having observed that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying, which opportunity is denied to the appellate courts" and "[a]bsent any substantial reason which would justify the reversal of the trial court's assessments and conclusions, the reviewing court is generally bound by the former's findings, particularly when no significant facts and circumstances are shown to have been overlooked or disregarded which when considered would have affected the outcome of the case." 
[26]
  This Court even recognizes a more stringent application of the rule if the said findings of the trial court are sustained by the appellate court.
In the present case, we found no substantial reason to deviate from the findings of the trial and appellate courts.
The evidence for the prosecution supports the veracity of the testimony and credibility of AAA.  In her 
Voluntary Statement
[27]
 dated February 28, 1997, AAA vividly recounted to SPO1 Lucy Mae Robles the sexual ordeals that she suffered at the hands of her father as follows:

T:

T:

S: 
 
Masakit po.

T: 
 
 
Ilang beses na ba ito ginawa ng papa mo sa pagpasok ng titi niya sa pekpek mo?
 
 
 
 
S: 
 
Simula po nuong August hanggang October 1996 mga lima o anim na beses po pinasok ni papa ang titi niya sa pekpek ko tapos simula naman po nuong niregla na ako ng November 5, 1996 daliri na lang po niya ang pinapasok niya sa pekpek ko hanggang Pebrero 12, 1997 mga alas siete (7) ng umaga.

In addition, AAA identified in court her birth certificate
[29]
 which proved that she was born on January 25, 1985 and corroborated her claim that she was only 11 years old at the time she was raped and sexually assaulted by the accused-appellant. The medico-legal report of Dr. Dennis Bellin proved that AAA sustained deeply healed hymenal lacerations which supported her claim that she was sexually abused.
The failure of the prosecution to prove the exact dates of the commission of the crimes charged is immaterial and would not warrant the reversal of accused-appellant's conviction. The exact time of the commission of the crime of rape is not a material ingredient of the said crime and it is sufficient if the acts complained of are alleged to have taken place as near to the actual date at which the offenses are committed as the information or complaint will permit.
[30]
  The gravamen of the crime of rape is carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation against her will or without her consent.
[31]
  As the exact date of the commission of the rape is not the essence of the crime and it is sufficient to allege in the information a date as near to the actual date of the offense as the circumstances allow, the dates of the rapes committed by the accused-appellant need not be proven exactly as alleged in the criminal informations.
The failure of AAA to recall minor details and the exact dates of the incidents of rape and sexual assault likewise does not affect the veracity of her testimony.  These lapses are understandable taking into account the nature of these crimes she suffered at her young age.  As we have held in a number of rape cases involving minor victims, the Court cannot impose the burden of exactness, detailedness, and flawlessness on the victim's recollection of her harrowing experiences.
[32]
Moreover, the credibility of AAA remains unaffected despite the purported lack of outward change in her behavior during and after the rape incidents and sexual assaults, which according to accused-appellant is contrary to human experience.  It is well-settled that no standard form of behavior can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult. 
[33]
  In 
People v. Baun
,
[34]
 we also held that the father's moral ascendancy and influence over his daughter substitutes for violence and intimidation in rape cases, thus:
Settled is the rule that in incestuous rape, the father's moral ascendancy and influence over his daughter substitutes for violence and intimidation.  The ascendancy or influence necessarily flows from the father's parental authority, which the constitution and the laws recognize, support and enhance, as well as from the children's duty to obey and observe reverence and respect towards their parents.  Such reverence and respect are deeply ingrained in the minds of Filipino children and are recognized by law. Abuse of both by a father can subjugate his daughter's will, thereby forcing her to do whatever he wants.
[35]
In this case, we take the fact that none of the other family members woke from their sleep whenever the accused-appellant sexually ravished AAA consistent with the latter's testimony that she actually did not fight back or resist out of fear of her father. Fear, confusion and shame would also explain why she did not immediately let anyone know of her father's dastardly acts against her. Indeed, that it took AAA several months to break free from her silence and disclose her unspeakable experiences was the proximate result of the accused-appellant's abuse of his moral ascendancy and influence over AAA as a father.
We have duly considered the evidence and arguments presented by the accused-appellant.  However, we cannot give any weight to his bare denials and uncorroborated alibis.  Our ruling in 
People v. Nieto
[36]
 
is in point:
It is an established jurisprudential rule that a mere denial, without any strong evidence to support it, can scarcely overcome the positive declaration by the victim of the identity and involvement of appellant in the crimes attributed to him.  The defense of 
alibi
 is likewise unavailing.

 is the weakest of all defenses, because it is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove.  Unless substantiated by clear and convincing proof, such defense is negative, self-serving, and undeserving of any weight in law.  
Secondly
, 
alibi
 is unacceptable when there is a positive identification of the accused by a credible witness.  
Lastly
, in order that alibi might prosper, it is not enough to prove that the accused has been somewhere else during the commission of the crime; it must also be shown that it would have been impossible for him to be anywhere within the vicinity of the crime scene.
In the case at bar, accused-appellant claims that at the times/dates of the rapes charged against him he was at his place of work.  Yet he failed to present any witness or documentary evidence to confirm his defense of 
alibi.
In sum, we find that the conviction of the accused-appellant on two counts of simple rape to be in order.  In view of the failure of the prosecution to allege in the criminal informations the aggravating/qualifying circumstance of parental relationship between AAA and the accused-appellant, he cannot be convicted of qualified rape for to do so would certainly be a denial of his right to be informed of the charges against him. However, this aggravating circumstance, which was duly proved during trial, may still be considered by the courts in the award of damages. Thus, the imposition of the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua,
 as well as the directive to accused-appellant to pay civil indemnity in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) and moral damages also in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00), for each count of rape are all in accord with law and jurisprudence.
Moreover, the Court agrees with plaintiff-appellee that the accused-appellant should be similarly ordered to pay exemplary damages in the amount of Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) for each count of rape.  Settled jurisprudence dictates that exemplary damages should be awarded in order to deter fathers with perverse tendencies and aberrant sexual behavior from preying upon their young daughters.
