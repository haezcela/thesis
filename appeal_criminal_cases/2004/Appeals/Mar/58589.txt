PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. JOSE SANTOS Y RUIZ, APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


For automatic review is the Decision
[1]
 dated November 27, 1998 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 78, Malolos, Bulacan in Criminal Cases Nos. 1267-M-97 to 1272-M-97 convicting Jose Santos y Ruiz, appellant, of six (6) counts of rape and sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of death in each count and to pay P50,000.00 as moral damages.
The Information in Criminal Case No. 1267-M-97 charges appellant as follows:  
âThat sometime in the year 1996, in the municipality of Balagtas, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, and with the use of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the said Vanessa Bancefra y Reyes, 13 years of age, against her will.
âCONTRARY to law.â
[2]
The other five (5) Informations in Criminal Cases Nos. 1268-M-97 to 1272-M-97 read:  
âThat sometime in the year 1997, in the municipality of Balagtas, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, and with the use of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the said Vanessa Bancefra y Reyes, 13 years of age, against her will.
âCONTRARY to law.â
[3]
Upon arraignment on September 26, 1997, appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the crimes charged. Trial ensued thereafter.
The evidence for the prosecution shows that complainant Vanessa Bancefra, thirteen (13) years old, is the daughter of spouses Ronnie Bancefra and Cristina Santos. After the disappearance and long absence of Vanessaâs father, her mother, on September 15, 1990, cohabited with appellant. Sometime in 1992, Vanessa and her three (3) siblings lived with their mother and appellant at First Avenue, Caloocan City. After two (2) years, or in 1994, they transferred to Longos, Balagtas, Bulacan. On June 28, 1996, Cristina and appellant were married.
Sometime in 1996, at about 8:00 oâclock in the evening, appellant, Vanessa and her mother Cristina were at home in Longos, Balagtas, Bulacan. Appellant, then sitting on the stairs of their house, instructed his wife Cristina to buy food in the market. While Vanessa was watching television, appellant suddenly entered the house and sat beside her. Frightened, she moved away but he came closer and placed his arm on her shoulder which she removed abruptly. At that instance, he lighted a cigarette and went out of the house. When he returned, he closed the front door and ordered her to lie down. She refused, hence, he pushed her to the sofa. She resisted by kicking him but to no avail. He undressed her. Then he also removed his shorts and brief and placed himself on top of her. While holding her arms, he inserted his penis inside her vagina and made push and pull movements which caused her pain. After about half a minute, he stopped then resumed his bestial acts. After ravishing her, appellant put on his clothes and ordered her to wear her panty and shorts. She cried and noticed some blood on her vagina. She told him that she will âreport the incident.â However, he threatened to kill her and her family. Meanwhile, at about 8:30 oâclock in the evening, her mother arrived from the market. Vanessa did not report the incident to her mother because of appellantâs threat.
Sometime in 1997, while Vanessaâs mother was in the market and her brother Samuel was in their neighborâs house, appellant sexually abused her for the second time. She was watching television when he forced her to lie down. Again she refused but he pushed her to the sofa and undressed her. After removing his clothes, he went on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina, making push and pull movements. After having carnal knowledge of her, he threatened to kill her should she inform anybody about it. She cried while dressing up and kept the incident to herself.
Also in 1997, appellant sexually ravished Vanessa for the third time. That evening, her brother and her mother were away. She was then cooking while appellant was watching television. He called her but she ignored him. He then grabbed her hands and pulled her to the sofa. Again, against her will and consent, he undressed her, placed himself on top of her and inserted his penis inside her vagina, making push and pull movements. At that instance, she felt pain. After sexually abusing her, appellant smoked a cigarette and threatened to kill her if she reports the incident to anyone. All she could do was to cry.
For the fourth time, appellant had carnal knowledge of Vanessa, also in 1997. That evening, she was alone, reading a book and watching television. Appellant approached her, held her hands and dragged her to the sofa. He then ordered her to lie down and forcibly undress her. He also removed his clothes and placed himself on top of her. As in the past, she felt pain when he inserted his penis inside her vagina. She resisted by pushing him away. Still he succeeded in sexually abusing her. Once more, he threatened her.
For the fifth time and sixth times, also in 1997, appellant sexually ravished Vanessa through force and violence. He made similar threats should she report the incidents to anyone.
On June 23, 1997, when appellant was not at home, Vanessa mustered enough courage to reveal to her mother that he sexually abused her several times. This was prompted by the revelation of her youngest sister Hannah that appellant also sexually molested her by inserting his finger in her vagina.
Immediately, Cristina accompanied Vanessa to the Balagtas Police Station to report the incidents and to the PNP Crime Laboratory at Camp Olivas, PNP, San Fernando, Pampanga for her physical examination. Dr. Edgardo O. Gueco, who examined her, issued a Medico-Legal Report
[4]
 with the following findings:                                                        
âGENITAL:
 
 
PUBIC HAIR: 
Absent
 
 
 
 
LABIA MAJORA: 
Full, convex and coaptated
 
 
 
 
LABIA MINORA:
 Light brown and slightly 
 
 
hypertrophied
 
 
 
 
EXTERNAL VAGINAL ORIFICE:
 Offers strong resistance to 
 
 
the introduction of the examining little

VAGINAL CANAL: 
Narrow with prominent vaginal folds.
 
 
 
 
CERVIX: 
Normal
 
 
 
 
PERI-URETHRAL AND VAGINAL SMEARS:
 
 
Negative for the presence of 
 
 
spermatozoa.
 
 
 
 
REMARKS: 
Subject is in non-virgin state physically.â
Dr. Gueco confirmed on the witness stand that âthe lacerations in Vanessaâs hymen were deep, healed at 6 and 11 oâclock positions
[5]
 and shallow, healed at 4 and 7 oâclock positions.â
[6]
The defense raised the defenses of 
alibi
 and denial. He testified that he worked in the Philippine Refining Company, Paco, Manila. He reported early in the morning and went home late in the evening. Hence, he could not have raped Vanessa on the dates she mentioned.
On November 27, 1998, the trial court rendered a Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:  
âWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby finds accused JOSE SANTOS GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of six (6) counts of Rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, and hereby sentences him to suffer six (6) DEATH penalties (one for each count) and to pay private complainant Vanessa Bancefra the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) as moral damages.  
âSO ORDERED.â
[7]
Hence, this automatic review.
Appellant, in his brief, ascribes to the trial court the following errors:
âA 
âTHE COURT 
A QUO
 ERRED IN FINDING AND CONSEQUENTLY CONCLUDING THAT THE ACCUSED IS THE STEPFATHER OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT.
âB 
âTHE COURT 
A QUO
 ERRED IN ACCORDING FULL CREDENCE AND WEIGHT TO PRIVATE COMPLAINANTâS VERSION OF THE RAPE INCIDENTS.
âC  
âTHE COURT 
A QUO
 ERRED IN TOTALLY DISREGARDING THE UNDISPUTED FACT THAT ON ACCOUNT OF ACCUSEDâ WORK AS A CARPENTER IN THE PHILIPPINE REFINING COMPANY AT PACO, MANILA, HE LEAVES HOME EARLY IN THE MORNING AND COMES BACK HOME LATE IN THE EVENING.
âD
âTHE COURT 
A QUO
 ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE FELONY OF RAPE ON SIX (6) COUNTS.
âE  
âTHE COURT 
A QUO
 ERRED IN IMPOSING ON ACCUSED SIX (6) PENALTIES OF DEATH DESPITE THE INSUFFICIENCY THEREFOR OF THE EVIDENCE.â  
As alleged in the Informations, the crimes charged were committed sometime in 1996 and 1997. Thus, the law applicable to the cases at bar is Article 335 the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659,
[8]
 which provides:  
âArticle 335. 
When and how rape is committed
. â Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:  
By using force or intimidation;
  
  
When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and  
  
When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented. 
The crime of rape shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.      
x x x 
 
x x x 
 
x x x 
The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:  
When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law-spouse of the parent of the victim.       
x x x 
 
x x x 
 
x x x." 
Rape under the above provisions is either simple or qualified. It is qualified when the age of the victim (below 18) and her relationship with the appellant are both alleged in the Information and proved.
[9]
Here, the prosecution did not allege in the six (6) Informations the qualifying circumstance that appellant is the victimâs step-parent. Also, while the Informations allege that the victim was 13 years old when she was sexually abused by appellant, however, the prosecution failed to prove such minority. Thus, appellant may only be charged of simple rape.
Simple rape is committed under 
any
 of the following circumstances:  
By using force or 
intimidation;
  
  
When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and  
  
When the woman is under twelve years of age (statutory rape) or is demented.
In reviewing rape cases, we are guided by the following principles: (1) to accuse someone of rape is easy, but to disprove it is difficult though the accused may be innocent; (2) considering that in the nature of things, only two persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit and not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. Corollarily to these is the dictum that where a victim of rape says that she has been defiled, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on her, and so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.
[10]
 In the light of these principles, we examined the testimony of the victim and found no reason to overturn the trial courtâs assessment of her credibility.
An extract from Vanessaâs testimony, quoted hereunder, indubitably shows that appellant, in all six (6) instances, 
had carnal knowledge of her by using force and intimidation, thus:

[16]
The trial court found Vanessaâs testimony credible since it was forthright, direct and straightforward; and that being credible, her testimony is sufficient to sustain the conviction of appellant of rape in all six (6) counts, thus:  
âPrivate complainant narrated in a straightforward, detailed and unwavering manner how the accused forcibly made her lie and, thereafter, lied on top of her with his body making a push-and-pull movement. Her testimony, viewed in its entirety and on the face of the supporting evidence of the prosecution and her instinctive demeanor in court, well deserves evidentiary weight and credence sufficient to warrant a finding for the State.â
We stress the well-settled doctrine that the lower courtâs assessment of the credibility of a witness is accorded great respect owing to its direct opportunity to observe the latterâs demeanor during trial. In 
People vs. Ayuda
,
[17]
 we held:  
âIt is doctrinally settled that the factual findings of the trial court, especially on the credibility of the rape victim, are accorded great weight and respect and will not be disturbed on appeal. This is so because the trial court has the advantage of observing the victim through the different indicators of truthfulness or falsehood, such as the angry flush of an insisted assertion, the sudden pallor of a discovered lie, the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer, the forthright tone of a ready reply, the furtive glance, the blush of conscious shame, the hesitation, the yawn, the sigh, the candor or lack of it, the scant or full realization of the solemnity of an oath, or the carriage and mien. x x x.â
In his brief, appellant assails Vanessaâs credibility by pointing flaws to her testimony, specifically her inability to recall the exact time and dates of the commission of each crime.
It bears stressing that âan impeccable recollection cannot reasonably be expected from the victim of a horrendous crime, such that minor contradictions in her testimony are perceived to enhance, rather than detract from, her credibility.â
[18]
 
The exact time or date of the commission of rape is not an element of the crime
. What is decisive is that the prosecution has sufficiently proved that the appellant committed the crime charged.
[19]
 Moreover, a close scrutiny of the records shows that the supposed flaws bear on relatively minor points and, even taken as a whole, they fail to debunk the gravamen of the accusation that appellant
 had sexually ravished the victim six (6) times by using force or intimidation
.
Neither are we persuaded by appellantâs claim that his work in the Philippine Refining Company at Paco, Manila required him to be there early in the morning until late evening, and as such, it was physically impossible for him to have been at home every time the alleged crimes were committed.
On this point, appellant should have established by sufficient proof that not only was he in Paco, Manila when the crimes were committed but also it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crimes. Obviously, considering the present means of transportation, it was not physically impossible for appellant to be at Longos, Balagtas, Bulacan when the crimes were committed.
Appellantâs defense of denial is inherently weak. We have held that âthe defense of denial assumes significance only when the prosecutionâs evidence is such that it does not prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Mere denial, unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is negative self-serving evidence which cannot be given greater evidentiary weight than the testimony of the complaining witness who testified on affirmative matters.â 
[20]
As earlier stated, considering that the qualifying circumstance of relationship between appellant and herein victim was not alleged in the Informations and that her age, although alleged therein, was not proved, appellant cannot be convicted of six (6) counts of qualified rape and sentenced to suffer the death penalty in each count. He should only be convicted of six (6) counts of simple rape and meted the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua 
in each count.
Anent the award of damages, we observed that the trial court awarded the victim only moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00.
In 
People vs. Pancho
,
[21]
 we reiterated that upon a finding of the fact of rape, the award of civil indemnity is mandatory. If the death penalty is imposed, the indemnity ex delicto should be P75,000.00. Where, as here, the death penalty is not decreed, the victim should be entitled to P50,000.00 only (for each count of simple rape).
Also, in line with current jurisprudence, we award the victim moral damages of P50,000.00 in each count of simple rape without need of pleading or proof of the basis thereof.
[22]
 This is so because the anguish and pain she has endured are evident.
WHEREFORE
, the assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 78, Malolos, Bulacan, in Criminal Cases Nos. 1267-M-97 to 1272-M-97 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION
 in the sense that appellant Jose Santos y Ruiz is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of six (6) counts of 
simple rape
 and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 in each count. He is ordered to pay the victim, Vanessa R. Bancefra, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages in each count.
