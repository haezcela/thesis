PER CURIAM:


This is an automatic review of the Decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna, Branch 31, finding appellant Rolando Leonor y Andante guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, sentencing him to suffer the death penalty and ordering him to pay the victim Lovely Faith Leonor the sums of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity; P50,000.00 as moral damages; and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.
The Indictment
On July 11, 1997, an Information charging Rolando Leonor with rape was filed in the Regional Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna, docketed as Criminal Case No. 0456-SPL. The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on or about February 1, 1997, in the Municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused being the father of 6-year-old LOVELY FAITH LEONOR, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie and succeed in having carnal knowledge with said LOVELY FAITH LEONOR.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
[2]
On July 17, 1997, the appellant, duly assisted by Atty. Jose Imbang, was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.
[3]
The Case for the Prosecution
[4]
The Spouses Emily Pajo and Rolando Leonor were residents of Brgy. Langgam, San Pedro Laguna.
[5]
 They had four children: Lovely Faith, who was born on October 25, 1990;
[6]
 Emmanuel; April Jay; and, Jesus Jay.
[7]
 To support themselves and their children, Rolando worked as a taxi driver,
[8]
 while Emily worked as a beautician who rendered home service manicure in the neighborhood.
[9]
 Emily often caught Rolando sniffing prohibited drugs.
[10]
 Every time she confronted Rolando, he mauled her.
[11]
 Worse, in July 1996, Rolando stopped giving financial support to his children.
[12]
 When she could not take it any longer, Emily and her children left Rolando and moved to the house of her mother, Priscilla Pajo and the latterâs husband, Romy Pabelando.
[13]
 Rolando lived in his motherâs house, which was just adjacent to Priscillaâs house. Rolando often visited Emily and the children. At times he would sleep with them in Priscillaâs house.
[14]
At or about 1:30 p.m. on February 1, 1997, after Emily had to service a customer, Rolando went to the house of Priscilla. The latter was cooking food in the kitchen.
[15]
 Emmanuel, who was five (5) years old, was seated on the bench in the sala with Lovely Faith. They were watching television. Rolando went near his children, unzipped his pants and pulled up (â
nilislis
â) Lovely Faithâs shorts and panties. He then inserted his penis inside her vagina. Unable to make a full penetration, Rolando withdrew his penis and inserted his middle finger inside Lovely Faithâs vagina. Priscilla heard Lovely Faith crying, 
âAray ko, Nanay, sinundot na naman ako ni Papa.â
[16]
 Priscilla rushed to the sala and saw Lovely Faith crying as she held her private part.
[17]
 Priscilla also noticed that Lovely Faithâs shorts were pulled down up to her thigh, while Rolando held the front part of his pants and ran away.
[18]
 Lovely Faith spontaneously told her grandmother that her father had sexually abused her previously, five times. She also told Priscilla that she did not tell her mother about it because her father threatened to kill her and her mother if she told anyone of the incidents.
[19]
 Immediately, Priscilla had Rolando arrested by the 
Barangay Tanods
.
[20]
 She also accompanied Lovely Faith to the police station where Priscilla executed a sworn statement regarding the incident. Dr. Jaime A. Barron, Chief of the Department of Public Health and Services of San Pedro, Laguna, conducted a medico-legal examination on Lovely Faith and found a healed laceration in her hymen at 1:00 oâclock position.
[21]
When Emily returned home at 5:00 p.m., Emmanuel told her, 
âMama, si Ate binaboy ni Papa.â
[22]
 Emily looked for Lovely Faith, and Emmanuel told her that Priscilla brought her to town. Emily immediately went to the police station of San Pedro, Laguna, and saw Lovely Faith beside Priscilla. Lovely Faith told her story that Rolando had inserted his penis into her vagina and that when he was unable    to fully penetrate her vagina, he withdrew his penis and inserted his finger instead. Lovely Faith also told her mother that Rolando had done 
âkababuyanâ
 to her five times
[23]
 but she did not say anything because her father had threatened to kill her, her mother, and grandmother, if she told anyone of his sexual assaults on her. Lovely Faith related to her mother that Rolando always used a knife to threaten her.
[24]
On February 3, 1997, Lovely Faith executed a Sworn Statement identifying her father, the appellant, as the perpetrator of the crime charged.
[25]
 A similar sworn statement was executed by Emily.
[26]
 A complaint for rape against the appellant was, thereafter, filed by Lovely Faith, with the assistance of her mother, Emily.
[27]
The Case for the Appellant
[28]
Rolando denied the charge against him. He testified that on January 31, 1997,
[29]
 he arrived at the house of Emily and opened the room of Romy Pabelando, his wifeâs stepfather, and found the two âon top of each other.â His mother-in-law, Priscilla, was also inside the room, acting as a âbugawâ (pimp).
[30]
 At 11:00 a.m. on February 1, 1997, he went to Priscillaâs house to bring pork viand to his children. Priscilla, who was tending her store, let him in. Inside the house, some of his children were sleeping. Lovely Faith was in the sala watching over her youngest brother. He kissed Lovely Faith on the cheek and embraced her. He noticed that Lovely Faith was wearing pajamas and seemed to be sick.
[31]
 He was later surprised that a complaint for rape was filed against him by his own daughter. He suspected that Lovely Faith was coached by her mother, grandmother and his wifeâs stepfather and paramour, Romy Pabelando.
[32]
Lucita Leonor, the appellantâs sister, testified that the appellant was a responsible father and that he supported his children through his earnings as a taxi driver.
[33]
 Even when he and Emily separated, he brought food to his children in the house of his mother-in-law. On February 1, 1997, the appellant went to her, crying, and revealed that his wife was having an affair with her stepfather.
[34]
 She saw Rolando in the afternoon of that day as he went to the house of his mother-in-law to bring pork viand to his children. She was later surprised that a complaint for rape was filed against him.
Ruling of the Trial Court
On November 7, 1997, the trial court promulgated a Decision finding Rolando guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping his sixâyear-old daughter. The dispositive portion of the decision read:
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds that the prosecution assisted by Assistant Prosecutor Melchorito Lomarda has duly established beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of Rolando Leonor y Andante for the crime of rape defined and penalized in Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659. To the mind of the Court, incestuous rape is indeed repugnant and outrageous not only to a civilized but also to a barbaric society. Indeed, accused has descended himself to a level lower than a beast when he perpetuated his lascivious design on his own flesh and blood.
WHEREFORE, the Court hereby sentences accused Rolando Leonor y Andante to suffer the penalty of death, to pay the private complainants the sums of P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages and P50,000 as exemplary damages, and to pay the costs.
[35]
The trial court gave probative value to the âunshaken, unflawed and consistentâ
[36]
 testimony of Lovely Faith that she was raped by her father. The trial court disbelieved the appellantâs claim that Lovely Faith was coached by her mother, Emily, whom he allegedly caught in an uncompromising situation with her own stepfather. It also found that the appellantâs defense of denial was weak and could not prevail over the positive assertions of Lovely Faith, especially since the latterâs testimony was corroborated by the    medico-legal findings of Dr. Jaime Barron.
The appellant assails the decision of the trial court contending that the crime lodged against him was a concoction of his wife and mother-in-law to cover up the illicit relationship between his wife, Emily, and her stepfather, Romy Pabelando.
The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), for its part, asserts that the trial court correctly found that Lovely Faith, a six-year-old naive girl, lacked ill-motive to testify falsely against her own father. It also contends that the appellantâs defenses of alibi and denial are weak and cannot prevail over the positive, straightforward and sincere testimony of Lovely Faith.
However, the Office of the Solicitor General contends that the trial court erred in awarding only P50,000.00 as civil indemnity to the victim and asserts that the amount should be increased to P75,000.00.
The Courtâs Ruling
The appellantâs contentions have no merit.
At the outset, we reiterate the well-constructed rule that in reviewing rape cases, the appellate court is guided by the following principles: (a) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (b) due to the nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and, (c) evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.
[37]
 Consequently, it is the primordial duty of the prosecution to present its case with clarity and persuasion to the end that conviction becomes the only logical conclusion.
[38]
The legal aphorism is that the findings of the trial court, its calibration and assessment of the testimonial evidence of the witnesses, and its conclusion based on its findings, are accorded by the appellate court high respect, if not conclusive effect.
[39]
 This is so because the trial judge, having seen and heard the witnesses and observed their behavior and manner of testifying, is in a better position to determine their credibility.
[40]
 An exception to this rule is when the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misinterpreted cogent facts and circumstances of substance which, if considered, would alter the outcome of the case.
[41]
Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: (1) by using force or intimidation; (2) when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and, (3) when the woman is under twelve (12) years of age. Even though neither of the circumstances mentioned in the two next preceding paragraphs shall be present, the gravamen of rape is carnal knowledge of a woman against her will or without    her consent.
[42]
After careful review of the records, we find no reason to reverse the findings of the trial court. Lovely Faith, who was only six (6) years old when the appellant ravished her,    testified in a positive, spontaneous, straightforward and consistent manner    that the appellant satisfied his bestial desires, viz:

A:
Yes, Sir.
 
 
Q:
And in the following question by the Honorable Judge who asked you, âWhy donât you love your father? And the answer you have given is (sic) that: âkasi po binaboy niya ako.â Is that right?

[45]
The defense foisted by the appellant on the Court, that Lovely Faith was coached by her mother to conceal the latterâs alleged illicit relationship with her stepfather, has been unsubstantiated. Motives such as feuds, resentment or revenge have never swayed us from giving full credence to the testimony of a minor complainant.
[46]
In a litany of cases, this Court has ruled that the testimonies of child-victims of rape are to be given full weight and credence. Reason and experience dictate that a girl of tender years, who barely understands sex and sexuality, is unlikely to impute to any man a crime so serious as rape, if what she claims is not true. The testimony of Lovely Faith is replete with details such that she could not have testified the way she did even if she was coached.
[47]
Lovely Faith was so devastated by the sexual assaults by her own father that when asked in open Court if she wanted to go near her father and embrace and kiss him, she obstinately refused:
Q:
Where is Lovely Faith? You want to go near your father? You want to kiss your father?
 
 
PROS. LOMARDA:
 
We would like to make it of record that each time the Honorable Court asks question do you want to kiss your father, the child just simply shakes her head.
 
 
COURT: (to Lovely Faith)
Lovely Faith, you answer to (sic) the question of the court.
 
 
Q:
 Do you want to go near your father?
A:
âAyoko po.â (I donât want.)
 
 
Q:
Do you want to kiss your father?
A:
âAyoko po.â
 
 
Q:
 Do you want to embrace your father?
A:
âAyoko po.â
 
 
Q:
Do you want to talk to your father?
A:
âAyoko po.â
[48]
Lovely Faithâs testimony was even corroborated by the findings of Dr. Jaime Barron that he found a laceration in her hymen at 1:00 oâclock position when he examined her. We have ruled that when the victimâs testimony is corroborated by the physicianâs findings of penetration, as when the hymen is no longer intact, then there is sufficient foundation to conclude    the existence of the essential requisite of carnal knowledge.
[49]
 Mere touching by the maleâs organ of the labia of the 
pudendum
 of the femaleâs private part is sufficient to consummate rape.
[50]
The trial court was correct in brushing aside appellantâs denial and alibi. As a rule, these defenses are negative and self-serving and are always received with caution â not only because they are inherently weak and unreliable, but also because they are easy to fabricate. Lack of defense cannot prevail over and are worthless in the face of the positive and categorical statements of the victim.
[51]
 To be believed, these weak defenses must be buttressed by strong evidence of innocence, otherwise, they are considered self-serving and of no evidentiary value.
[52]
 The appellantâs convoluted testimony on the illicit affair between his wife and the latterâs stepfather has not been corroborated. 
The Crime Committed by the Appellant
The trial court correctly ruled that the appellant is guilty of qualified rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659, 
viz:
ART. 335. When and how rape is committed. - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
 By using force or intimidation;
 When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and
 When the woman is under twelve years of age, even though neither of the circumstances mentioned in the two next preceding paragraphs shall be present.
The crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.
Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death.
When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.
When the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be, likewise, death.
When by reason or on occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty is death.
The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
 When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
â¦
The concurrence of the victimâs minority and her relationship to the accused must be both alleged and proven beyond reasonable doubt.
[53]
 In the present case, the Information alleges that the victim was six (6) years old at the time of the commission of the crime and that the perpetrator is her father. The prosecution adduced in evidence a certified true copy of Lovely Faithâs birth certificate showing that she was born on October 25, 1990 and that her father is the appellant. She was just a little over six (6) years of age on February 1, 1997, when she was raped by the appellant. The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.
[54]
 It is also a 
prima facie
 evidence of filiation.
[55]
Thus, the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the victimâs minority and her relationship to the appellant. As such, the trial court correctly imposed the death penalty.
The Civil Liabilities of the Appellant
The trial court correctly awarded moral and exemplary damages to the victim, Lovely Faith Leonor. However, the award of moral damages should be increased to P75,000.00, conformably to current jurisprudence,
[56]
 while the award of exemplary damages should be reduced to P25,000.00.
[57]
Three Justices of the Court maintain their position that Republic Act No. 7659 is unconstitutional insofar as it prescribes the death penalty; nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the majority that the law is constitutional, and that the death penalty can be lawfully imposed in the case at bar. 
IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING,
 the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna, Branch 31, convicting the appellant Rolando Leonor y Andante of qualified rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, and sentencing him to suffer the death penalty is 
AFFIRMED
, with the 
MODIFICATION
 that the award for civil indemnity is increased to Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00), and the award for exemplary damages is reduced to Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00). No costs.
SO ORDERED.
