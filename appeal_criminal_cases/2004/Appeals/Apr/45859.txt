[1]
On his arraignment, appellant, assisted by counsel 
de oficio
, Atty. Harley Padolina of the Public Attorneyâs Office (PAO), pleaded âguiltyâ to the charges.
The Solicitor General summed up the case for the prosecution; 
viz:
âPrivate complainant Anna Liza Oden is a fifteen (15) year old girl who lived with her siblings and father x x x at Senora Dela Paz, Brgy. Sta. Cruz, Antipolo City.  Her mother [has] already [passed away].
âOn 26 August 2000,    about 2:00 oâclock in the morning, Anna Liza - - then only about fourteen (14) years old - - was sleeping with her younger sister in bed, when her father woke her up.  Accused told her that he is going to `useâ her for a while.  Hurriedly, he undressed Anna Liza, and, in an instant, inserted his penis in her vagina.  As he was doing so, accused kissed Anna Lizaâs breast.  Anna Liza fought back and resisted such bestiality by kicking him, but to no avail.  She even pushed her younger sister who was asleep just to wake her up.  Anna Lizaâs resistance, however, was in vain as accused successfully penetrated his penis inside Anna Lizaâs vagina.  This caused Anna Liza to bleed in pain.  Accused stopped only when he had satisfied his lust.  Thereupon, accused threatened Anna Liza not to tell others what happened between them; otherwise, he would kill her and her siblings.  Helpless, Anna Liza acceded to her fatherâs threat and never reported the incident to anyone.
âOn September 10, 11, and 12, 2000, about 11:00 oâclock in the evening, accused repeated what he had done to Anna Liza on 26 August 2000.  On all of those three (3) occasions, accused succeeded in inserting his penis inside Anna Lizaâs vagina against her will and consent.  Similar sexual assaults were made on October 15, 16, and 27, 2000 in their house.
âOn November 3, 8, and 9, 2000, accused-appellant again repeated his sexual molestation of Anna Liza.  On those dates at early morning, accused entered Anna Lizaâs vagina against the latterâs will.
âOn December 25, 2000, around 10:00 oâclock in the evening, accused-appellant â for the eleventh (11th) time - sexually    assaulted private complainant (Anna Liza).     After the molestation, Anna Liza could only cry in helplessness.
âOn January 8, 2001, around 9:00 oâclock in the evening, while Anna Liza was sleeping with her sister Josephine in their bedroom, accused woke her (Anna Liza) up, and again sexually assaulted her.
âDue to fear, Anna Liza did not report to anyone all the twelve (12) incidents of sexual molestation.
âHowever, unknown to Anna Liza, her Ate Mercy (wife of the complainantâs brother â Arnold Oden) witnessed the rape that took place on 08 January 2001.  Ate Mercy saw through a small hole on the wall inside the house - separating her bedroom from that of Anna Lizaâs â what accused had done to her (Anna Liza).  And it was not only Ate Mercy who witnessed the rape.  Arnold Oden (brother of Anna Liza) also saw what the accused had done to Anna Liza.  Arnold was mad at accused; however he was not able to do anything because he, together with the rest of the siblings, were afraid of their father (accused) - the reason being that everytime accused would get angry, he would beat all of them.
âNonetheless, Ate Mercy reported to a neighbor, Nanay Ludy, Anna Lizaâs harrowing experience on 08 January 2001.  In turn, Nanay Ludy talked to Anna Liza and directed her to report the incident to the barangay.  Anna Liza heeded Nanay Ludyâs directive.  She proceeded to the barangay - together with her Ate Mercy and Ate Marilou (wives of Anna Lizaâs older brothers) - and reported her fatherâs outrageous wrongdoings.  On 28 January 2001, based on Anna Lizaâs sworn statement, the barangay officials, together with the police, arrested accused-appellant.â
[2]
After the prosecution had rested its case with the testimony of its lone witness (the private complainant), Atty. Harley Padolina (PAO) manifested that the defense would not present any evidence.
On 18 March 2002, the trial court rendered a decision finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of twelve counts of rape; it adjudged:
âWHEREFORE, after a careful cursory on the case, the evidences presented by the prosecution which have remained unassailed by the defense due to the voluntary plea of guilty by the accused to all the offense charged, this Court finds said accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt and is hereby ordered to suffer the extreme penalty of death through lethal injection for each case.  That said penalty shall be enforced upon the accused after a year and a half from the date said judgment shall have become final and executory or on the month of October 30, 2003 at 3:00 p.m.
âThe court hereby award to private complainant as civil indemnity the amount of P75,000.00 as compensatory damages and the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages.â
[3]
In the review of his various cases by this Court, appellant asserts that his plea of guilty has been improvidently made on the mistaken belief that he would be given a lighter penalty with his plea of guilt.
[4]
 On this particular score, the Solicitor General agrees.
There is merit in the observation.
Section 3, Rule 116, of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure is explicit on the procedure to be taken when an accused pleads guilty to a capital offense, 
viz
:
â
SEC. 3.  Plea of guilty to capital offense; reception of evidence.
 - When the accused pleads guilty to a capital offense, the court shall conduct a searching inquiry into the voluntariness and full comprehension of the consequences of his plea and shall require the prosecution to prove his guilt and the precise degree of culpability.  The accused may present evidence in his behalf.â
The trial court is mandated (1) to conduct a searching inquiry into the voluntariness and full comprehension of the consequences of the plea of guilt, (2) to require the prosecution to still prove the guilt of the accused and the precise degree of his culpability, and (3) to inquire whether or not the accused wishes to present evidence on his behalf and allow him to do so if he desires.  The records must show the events that have actually taken place during the inquiry, the words spoken and the warnings given, with special attention to the age of the accused, his educational attainment and socio-economic status, the manner of his arrest and detention, the attendance of counsel in his behalf during the custodial and preliminary investigations, and the opportunity of his defense counsel to confer with him.  All these matters should be able to provide trustworthy indices of his competence to give a free and informed plea of guilt.  The trial court must describe the essential elements of the crimes the accused is charged    with and their respective penalties and civil liabilities.  It should also direct a series of questions to defense counsel to determine whether or not he has conferred with the accused and has completely explained to him the legal implications of a plea of    guilt.
[5]
The process is mandatory and absent any showing that it has been duly observed, a searching inquiry cannot be said to have been aptly undertaken.
[6]
 The trial court must be extra solicitous to see to it that the accused fully understands the meaning and importance of his plea.  In capital offenses
[7]
 particularly, life being at stake, one cannot just lean on the presumption that the accused has understood his plea.
[8]
While the records of the case are indeed bereft of any indication that the rule has sufficiently been complied with, the evidence for the prosecution outside of the plea of guilt, nevertheless, would adequately establish the guilt of appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
[9]
 The manner by which the plea of guilt is made, whether improvidently or not, loses much of great significance where the conviction can be based on independent evidence proving the commission by the person accused of the offense charged.

The prosecution presented at the witness stand Anna Liza.  She recounted straightforwardly and in sufficient detail the twelve harrowing and humiliating incidents of rape she had suffered in the hands of her own father.She testified:

In rape cases, the lone testimony of the victim, if credible and free from fatal and material inconsistencies and contradictions, can be the basis for the prosecution and conviction of an accused.
[12]
 The rule can no less be true than when a rape victim testifies against her own father; unquestionably, there would be reason to give it greater weight than usual.  In any event, matters affecting credibility are best left to the trial court with its peculiar opportunity to observe the deportment of a witness on the stand as against the reliance by an appellate court on the mute pages of the records of the case.
[13]
 The spontaneity with which the victim has detailed the incidents of rape, the tears she has shed at the stand while recounting her experience, and her consistency almost throughout her account dispel any insinuation of a rehearsed testimony.  The eloquent testimony of the victim, coupled with the medical findings attesting to her non-virgin state, should be enough to confirm the truth of her charges.
The death penalty, however, was indeed erroneously imposed.  The Solicitor General conceded that the prosecution had failed to establish private complainantâs age at the time of commission of the offenses.  It was only the bare statement of the victim, when asked to describe her personal circumstances in the hearing held on 05 February 2002, that mention was made of her being merely 17 years of age.
The age of the victim, in order that this qualifying circumstance can be properly considered, needs to be credibly proved.
[14]
 In 
People vs. Javier
,
[15]
 the Court explains:
âx x x Although the victimâs age was not contested by the defense, proof of age of the victim is particularly necessary in this case considering that the victimâs age which was then 16-years old [was] just two years less than the majority age of 18.  In this age of modernism, there is hardly any difference between a 16-year old girl and an 18-year old one insofar as physical features and attributes are concerned.  A physically developed 16-year old lass may be mistaken for an 18-year old young woman, in the same manner that a frail and young looking 18-year old lady may pass [for] a 16-year old minor.  Thus, it is in this context that independent proof of the actual age of a rape victim becomes vital and essential so as to remove an iota of doubt that the victim [was] indeed under 18 years of age as to fall under the qualifying circumstances enumerated in Republic Act No. 7659.  In a criminal prosecution especially of cases involving the extreme penalty of death, nothing but proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which an accused is charged must be established by the prosecution in order for said penalty to be upheld, x x x.  Verily, the minority of the victim must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself.  Otherwise, failure to sufficiently establish the victimâs age is fatal and consequently bars conviction for rape in its qualified form.â
[16]
In 
People vs. Galas
,
[17]
 the Court has held:
âTo justify the imposition of death, proof of the victimâs age is indubitable.  There must be sufficient and clear evidence proving her age, even if not denied by the accused.  A duly certified certificate of his birth accurately showing the complainantâs age or some other authentic document such as a baptismal certificate or a school record, has been recognized as competent evidence.
âWhile it may be true that the testimony of a person as to her age, although hearsay, is admissible as evidence of family tradition, we cannot consider Sharonâs statement at the beginning of her testimony describing her personal circumstances as proof of age beyond reasonable doubt that we have considered indispensable in the criminal prosecution of cases involving the extreme penalty of death.  No corroborative or supporting evidence was presented by the prosecution.  Although a `certified transcription copyâ of a certificate of live birth of Sharon Galas is found on page 10 of the Record of the preliminary investigation held by the 16th Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Jordan, Guimaras, this document was not presented in evidence during the trial.  Accordingly, it does not form part of the record of the case and not having been formally offered nor marked as an exhibit, it cannot be considered as evidence nor be given evidentiary value.â
[18]
And thus, too, is the ruling of the Court in 
People vs. Tipay
[19]
 -
âThis does not mean, however, that the presentation of the certificate of birth is at all times necessary to prove minority.  The minority of a victim of tender age who may be below the age of 10 is quite manifest and the court can take judicial notice thereof.  The crucial years pertain to the ages of 15 to 17 where minority may seem to be indubitable due to oneâs physical appearance.  In this situation, the prosecution has the burden of proving with certainty the fact that the victim was under 18 years of age when the rape was committed in order to justify the imposition of the death penalty under the above cited provision.
âThe record of the case at bar is bereft of any independent evidence which would accurately show complainantâs age.  That complainantâs age was alleged in the information and/or complaint as under 16 years is not sufficient.  Nor does the lack of denial on the part of accused-appellant excuse the prosecution from discharging its burden in this regard.â
[20]
It is the burden of the prosecution to prove with moral certainty the minority of the victim, 
i.e
., below 18 years of age at the time of commission of rape, coupled with the requisite relationship, in order to justify the imposition of the death penalty.
Moral damages, in addition to civil indemnity, are awarded to rape victims.  The father-daughter relationship between the accused and the rape victims also justifies the award of exemplary damages, a measure to help deter fathers with perverse tendencies and aberrant sexual behavior from preying upon and sexually abusing their daughters.
[21]
WHEREFORE, the decision under review is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.  Appellant Mario Oden is convicted of twelve (12) counts of simple rape and sentenced to 
reclusion perpetua
 for each count.  Appellant is further ordered to indemnify Anna Liza Oden in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) civil indemnity, Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) moral damages, and Twenty Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) exemplary damages for each count of rape.
SO ORDERED.
