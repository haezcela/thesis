PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. EDUARDO DOLLENDO AND NESTOR MEDICE, ACCUSED, NESTOR MEDICE, APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




PEREZ, J.:


Before this Court is an appeal from the Decision
[1]
 dated 28 November 2006 of the Court of Appeals, finding appellant Nestor Medice guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder.
The Facts
On 18 May 2001, appellant and Eduardo Dollendo (Dollendo) were accused of the crime of MURDER in Criminal Case No. C-2971 before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Catarman, Northern Samar.
[2]
On arraignment, only appellant entered a plea of not guilty.
[3]
 His co-accused Dollendo, although earlier arrested, escaped from the Provincial Jail at Dancalan, Bobon, Northern Samar.
[4]
 As Dollendo remained at-large prior to his arraignment, trial proceeded only with respect to appellant.
The prosecution presented the testimonies of the following: Mylene Ruiz,
[5]
 wife of victim Garry Ruiz (Ruiz); two (2) eyewitnesses to the crime, namely, Deolito Romines (Romines)
[6]
 and Joseph del Valle (del Valle);
[7]
 and Dr. Norma E. Dato,
[8]
 who examined the body of Ruiz.
Mylene Ruiz testified that on 10 February 2001, appellant and Dollendo went to her house looking for her husband Ruiz.  She asked the accused why so since the latter was out peddling fish.  The accused told her that they had a problem with him, which she would later find out when they meet.
[9]
Soon after, on 13 February 2001 at around 2:30 in the afternoon, Ruiz was killed at the house of Romines at 
Barangay
 West, San Jose, Northern Samar.  Eyewitnesses Romines and del Valle rendered a straightforward account of the incident in the following manner:
On that fateful afternoon, Del Valle, together with one Erles Anquillo and victim Ruiz were playing cards in the sala of Rominesâ house. Meanwhile, Romines was getting their 
pulutan 
ready.
[10]
 He was in the kitchen, which was about less than two (2) meters away from the sala,
[11]
 with an unobstructed view of the sala.
[12]
 The drinking session had not yet begun when appellant arrived. He did nothing and left immediately upon seeing them.
[13]
After two (2) minutes, appellant returned with his brother-in-law Dollendo.
[14]
 Ruiz did not notice them enter the house because his back was turned against the door.
[15]
 Appellant pulled out a bolo (
dipang
), handed it over to Dollendo saying, âUh! [Y]ou take care of it,â after which, he stepped back.
[16]
 Dollendo, in turn, immediately stabbed Ruiz on the left chest.
[17]
Del Valle ran to seek police assistance
[18]
 while Romines was left behind.  Romines recounted that after the first blow, three (3) successive stab blows were further delivered hitting Ruiz in his chest near the heart and in his arm.
[19]
 Thereafter, appellant and Dollendo fled towards the direction of P. Tingzon.
[20]
 Ruiz died on his way to the hospital.
[21]
Dr. Norma E. Dato, Municipal Health Officer, San Jose, Northern Samar, identified in court her Autopsy Report,
[22]
 showing that the death of the victim was caused by âshock secondary internal hemorrhage caused by st[a]b wounds,â which injured the heart, left lung, and blood vessels.  The four stab wounds were described as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
St[a]b wound No. 1 
 
 
- Length - Width 
 
 
- 1.2 cm - .8 cm 
 
 
located 2.9 cm above the left nipple 
 
 
 
 
St[a]b wound No. 2 
 
 
- Length - Width 
 
 
- 1.2 cm - .8 cm 
 
 
located about 4 cm. st[a]b wound No. 1 along the anterior axillary line 
 
 
 
 
St[a]b wound No. 3 
 
 
- Length - Width 
 
 
- 2.5 cm - .6 cm 
 
 
located on the left arm, midportions.  This is a through and through wound. 
 
 
 
 
St[a]b wound No. 4 
 
 
- Length - Width 
 
 
- 1 cm - .6 cm 
 
 
located 4 cm. below st[a]b wound No. 3.  This is a through & through wound 
 
 
 
She further testified that stab wound nos. 1 and 2 caused the death of Ruiz.
[23]
As the lone witness for the defense, appellant denied the charge against him and claimed that he never saw Dollendo on the date of the incident. He further alleged that he was then in the house of spouses Dafia Pusio and Dondon Morino, also in 
Barangay
 West, from 12:00 noon to 3:00 oâclock in the afternoon.
[24]
 He learned of the death of Ruiz only on 2 March 2001 when he was apprehended by the policemen.
[25]
On cross-examination, the following facts were elicited from the appellant: that Dollendo is his brother-in-law; that he had known victim Ruiz, and prosecution witnesses Romines and del Valle for a long time;
[26]
 that Dafiaâs house, where he allegedly stayed to watch betamax from 12:00 noon to 3:00 oâclock in the afternoon of 13 February 2001 and Rominesâ house, where Ruiz was killed, are only forty (40) meters apart ? one is, in fact, just across the other.
[27]
On 30 April 2003, the trial court convicted the appellant.
[28]
 The dispositive portion of the decision reads:
From the foregoing, the Court finds NESTOR MEDIC[E] guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal by induction of the crime of Murder and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to indemnify the heirs of the victim P50,000.00 and another P50,000.00 as moral damages and to pay the costs.
[29]
Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal
[30]
 dated 16 May 2003 with the trial court.   After the submission of their respective briefs, this Court ordered the transfer of the records of the case to the Court of Appeals, for appropriate action and disposition, in order to allow an intermediate review of the case.
[31]
On 28 November 2006, the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision
[32]
 in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00243 denying the appeal.  Thus:
WHEREFORE, 
the appeal is DENIED and the 
Decision 
dated 30 April 2003 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Catarman, Northern Samar, finding NESTOR MEDICE guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, and imposing on him the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua 
and to indemnify the heirs of the victim Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00), and another Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages and to pay the costs, is 
AFFIRMED 
subject to the modification that he shall indemnify the victim in the amount of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as exemplary damages.
[33]
Appealed to this Court, we required the parties to simultaneously file their respective supplemental briefs.
[34]
 Both manifested that they will no longer file supplemental pleadings.
[35]
Our Ruling
We affirm the appellantâs conviction.
To be convicted of murder, the following must concur: (1) a person was killed; (2) the accused killed him; (3) the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances enumerated in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code; and (4) the killing does not constitute parricide or infanticide.
[36]
Treachery qualified the killing to murder
     
The law provides that an offender acts with treachery when he âcommits any of the crimes against a person, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.â
[37]
 There is, thus, treachery when the attack against an unarmed victim is so sudden that he had clearly no inkling of what the assailant was about to do.
[38]
It is clear in the records that the circumstance of treachery is attendant in this case.  The aggressors ensured that the victim had no opportunity to resist or defend himself through the sudden and unexpected attack.  As testified to by Romines:
 
 
Q
 
Did the victim notice the two accused when they entered your house for the second time?
 
 
 
A
 
No, sir, because they came from his left side.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
How long thereafter after both accused entered your house when the first stabbing blow was delivered by Edgardo Dollendo to the victim?
 
 
 
A
 
It did not take long before the stabbing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[Q]
 
Do you mean to say that it was sudden when Edgardo Dollendo stabbed the victim?
 
 
 
A
 
Yes, sir.
[39]
 
 
Del Valle was likewise positive that Ruiz was not aware that he was about to be attacked.
 
 
Q
 
When the accused Eduardo Dollendo delivered the first blow to the victim did the victim notice that he was to be attacked by the accused Eduardo?
 
 
 
A
 
No, sir, he was beside [Ruiz].
[40]
 
 
As to whether the circumstance of treachery can qualify the killing to murder, the fact being that it was not expressly stated as such in the information, this Court has long clarified that âqualifying circumstances need not be preceded by descriptive words such as âqualifyingâ or âqualified byâ to properly qualify an offense.â
[41]
Evident premeditation was not established 
as an aggravating circumstance
The aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation may only be considered if the following are established:
(1) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the accused clung to his determination; and (3) a sufficient lapse of time between determination and execution to allow himself time to reflect upon the consequences of his act.
[42]
None of the requisites, however, is present in this case.  First, the testimony of Mylene Ruiz that appellant and Dollendo looked for her husband Ruiz on 10 February 2011 and that they told her that they have a problem to settle, is insufficient to conclude that the assailants have then decided to commit the crime.  Second, evidence is wanting to show when the offenders actually resolved to kill the victim.  Even assuming that they clung to their determination to commit the crime after it was ascertained that Ruiz was in the house of Romines, the lapse of two (2) minutes or so from the time appellant checked on the whereabouts of Ruiz to the time Ruiz was attacked is not sufficient to afford them time to reflect on the consequences of their actions,
[43]
 the essence of premeditation being âthat the execution of the act was preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during a space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.â
[44]
There was conspiracy to commit murder;
 
Appellant is, therefore, liable notwithstanding 
the evidence showing that it was only Dollendo 
who stabbed the victim
The prosecution clearly established that it was only Dollendo who stabbed Ruiz
.
 That appellant did not actually stab the victim does not, however, release him from criminal liability.
Article 8 of the Revised Penal Code provides that â[a] conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.â The âevidence of a chain of circumstances,â
[45]
 to wit: that appellant went inside the house of Romines to ascertain that the victim was there; that he fetched Dollendo to bring him to Ruiz; that he gave the 
dipang 
to Dollendo to commit the crime; and that they both fled after the stabbing, taken collectively, shows a community of criminal design to kill the victim.  Evidently, there was conspiracy in the commission of the crime.  Thus:
To be a conspirator, one need not participate in every detail of the execution; he need not even take part in every act xxx.  Each conspirator may be assigned separate and different tasks which may appear unrelated to one another but, in fact, constitute a whole collective effort to achieve their common criminal objective.  Once conspiracy is shown, the act of one is the act of all the conspirators. The precise extent or modality of participation of each of them becomes secondary, since all the conspirators are principals.
[46]
Defense of alibi cannot prosper; 
There was failure to establish physical impossibility 
to be at the locus criminis; 
Witnesses positively identified the assailants
It has been held time and again that alibi may prosper only when the accused establishes that not only was he somewhere else when the crime was committed but that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the 
locus criminis
 at that time.
[47]
In the instant case, appellant admitted that the house of his friend where he said he was at the time of the commission of the crime is only forty (40) meters away from the 
locus criminis
.
[48]
 Hence, it was not physically impossible for him to be at Rominesâ place during the killing incident.
Furthermore, positive identification destroys the defense of alibi, more so when such is credible and categorical,
[49]
 as it is in this case.  Positive identification by witnesses, absent any ill motive on their part, likewise prevails over the defense of denial.
[50]
All considered, we are convinced that the guilt of appellant has been sufficiently established with moral certainty.
Reclusion perpetua is the imposable penalty 
Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for murder is 
reclusion perpetua 
to death.  The proper imposable penalty on the appellant is 
reclusion perpetua 
inasmuch as neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances attended the commission of the crime.
[51]
Appellant is liable for civil indemnity,
 
moral damages,
 temperate damages
 
exemplary damages and 6% interest
 
per annum on all damages
 
until fully paid
The damages awarded by the Court of Appeals in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity, Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages, and Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as exemplary damages
[52]
 are in order.
We note, however, that both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals did not award damages to cover the unreceipted funeral expenses incurred by the surviving spouse.  While actual damages are not recoverable absent any receipt or supporting document pertaining to the expenses, temperate damages may be awarded in its stead.
[53]
 This is in accordance with Article 2224 of the Civil Code, which provides that temperate damages may be recovered âwhen the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature of the case, be proved with certainty."
[54]
 Undeniably, the heirs of Ruiz suffered pecuniary loss representing funeral and burial expenses, although the exact amount is not proved.
[55]
 Accordingly, the heirs of Ruiz shall be entitled to temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00.
[56]
Finally, consistent with recent jurisprudence on damages,
[57]
 interest on all damages at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of judgment until fully paid is likewise hereby imposed.
WHEREFORE
, the Decision dated 28 November 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00243 
DENYING 
the appeal of appellant Nestor Medice is 
AFFIRMED 
with 
MODIFICATION
.
Appellant is hereby found 
GUILTY 
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua. 
He is further ordered to pay the heirs of Gary G. Ruiz the sum of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity, Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages, Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) as temperate damages, Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as exemplary damages, and interest on all damages at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of judgment until fully paid.
