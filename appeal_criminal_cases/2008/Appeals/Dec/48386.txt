Joselito, the assistant lead clerk of the 7-Eleven Convenience Store, essentially corroborated Joel's testimony. He added that while peeping from the back of the Slurpee machine, he saw appellant Robert giving orders. Fearing for his safety, he (Joselito) bowed his head, turned his back and said a prayer. He and Joel came out from their hiding place when the media arrived ten (10) minutes after the robbery.
[9]
 He then saw the bloodied body of their security guard, Nestor Mayagma (
Nestor
), sprawled on the floor. He went back to the storeroom to calm himself. Afterwards, someone told him to bring Nestor to the hospital as he was still alive. He brought Nestor to the Lanting General Hospital where the latter soon after died.
[10]
Florencio, the security officer and general services supervisor of Phil-Seven Corporation, declared on the witness stand that after conducting an investigation, he found that the total items taken by the robbers amounted to P84,060.00.

The RTC summarized the testimony of Kuraishi as follows:

pambaon
" for his children; that he got off the car first and when he entered the store, he noticed a hold-up in progress because there were persons lying face down on the floor;

Allan, a cook at King Dimsum (a restaurant adjacent to the 7-Eleven Convenience Store), narrated that at around 2:00 a.m. of July 28, 1999, while he and his three (3) co-workers were cleaning the restaurant, he heard several gunshots. When they went out, he saw Diosdado peeping through the glass panel of the 7-Eleven Convenience Store.
[14]
 Thereafter, Diosdado pulled out a gun and entered the 7-Eleven Convenience Store; once inside, he bent a little and fired a shot. He further testified that he saw a man wearing a violet t-shirt pointing a gun at the people inside the convenience store. Afterwards, Diosdado went out towards their direction. As a result, he and his three (3) companions ran towards the kitchen of King Dimsum.
[15]
From inside the kitchen, he saw Diosdado approach two (2) taxicabs parked in front of the King Dimsum, wake up the drivers, and hold them up. Diosdado then proceeded towards a passenger jeepney parked under a Sampaloc tree.
[16]
 Suddenly, a maroon car arrived and parked near the 7-Eleven Convenience Store. The car's passenger alighted first and went inside the store. When the car's driver alighted from the car, Diosdado pointed his gun at the driver who raised his hands. At that point, Diosdado shot him in the chest. Fearing for his life, he (Allan) ran towards the bakery beside the restaurant. He heard two (2) more gunshots but did not see who fired them.
[17]
Conrado, a tricycle driver plying the Paniqui, Tarlac highway, recalled that at around 5:00 a.m. of July 28, 1999, while he was waiting for passengers, a green jeepney stopped and eight (8) untidy men alighted. Four (4) of them boarded his tricycle, while the others boarded another tricycle.
[18]
 He recalled the faces of two of his passengers - Joemari, who paid the fare, and Diosdado.
[19]
 The men alighted at 
Barangay
 Coral, Ramos, Tarlac. Thereafter, he returned to the highway and continued to ply his route until 8:00 a.m. At around 12:00 a.m. of July 29, 1999, he returned to the highway and overheard a certain

Ate
 Fe and informed her that he knew something about these eight (8) men. 
Ate
 Fe relayed the information to another tricycle driver who, in turn, reported it to the police.
[20]
 Thereafter, the Paniqui police came and brought him to the police headquarters.
[21]
 He accompanied the police to the place where he brought his four (4) passengers. They subsequently returned to the police station where the police had a brief meeting before returning to where he had brought his passengers.

SPO2 Gotera, a police officer assigned at the Caloocan Police Station, testified that on July 28, 1999, he received a call from Superintendent Tinio of the Malolos Provincial Command informing him that the driver and the jeepney used by the suspects in a Caloocan robbery were already in their custody.
[31]
 Responding to this development, he went to Malolos City (together with Major Borromeo, PO2 Arnold Gonzales and 
Bandera
 reporter Yoyoy Alano) and interrogated the driver. The latter told him that a group of armed men boarded his vehicle and held-up the Petron Gasoline Station and the 7-Eleven Convenience Store along Commonwealth, and, using his vehicle, proceeded to Paniqui, Tarlac.
[32]
He and his companions forthwith went to Paniqui. In coordination with the Paniqui police, they went to the place where the jeepney driver dropped off the suspects. They located Conrado - the driver of the tricycle used by four (4) of the suspects after alighting from the jeepney. Conrado led them to the compound where he brought the suspects.
[33]
On July 29, 1999, at around 4:00 a.m., SPO2 Gotera, together with other members of the Tarlac police, returned to 
Barangay
 Coral, Paniqui, Tarlac and surrounded the compound previously identified by Conrado as the place where he brought the suspects. An elderly man - later identified to be the father of FO1 dela Cruz - came out and was confronted by the police. He informed the police that there were eight (8) men inside their house. The police asked him to bring out his son. He did as bidded and came out with FO1 dela Cruz who was carrying a gun but who put it down when asked to do so by the police.
[34]
 FO1 dela Cruz thereafter told his companions to surrender but they refused to come out, prompting the police to give them an ultimatum. It was only then that the remaining seven (7) suspects came out and surrendered. They were identified as Alfredo Baracas, Audie Dona, Dominador Recepcion, Robert Alfonso, Joemari delos Reyes, Eduardo Palacpac, and Bernardo Ranara.
[35]
Jesus, a tricycle driver in Paniqui, Tarlac, corroborated the testimony of Conrado on material points. He added that he recognized one of his passengers - Eduardo - because the latter took some time in paying the P5.00 fare.
[36]
Edwin, delivery boy of Smacker's Bakeshop, testified that he was delivering bread to the 7-Eleven Convenience Store at Mindanao Avenue corner Tandang Sora at around 2:00 a.m. of July 28, 1999. After the security guard signed the delivery receipt, three (3) men who pretended to be customers entered the 7-Eleven Convenience Store and went to different sections of the store.
[37]
 Suddenly, another man - FO1 dela Cruz - shot the security guard from outside the store's glass door, shattering it. In retaliation, the security guard pulled out his gun and fired back. At this point, Joemari (one of the men who had earlier entered and who was behind him) pulled him down and ordered Edwin to lie face down.
[38]
 While the latter was in this position, Joemari took his watch and wallet.
[39]
 He saw FO1 dela Cruz enter the store and gunshots followed afterwards. Joemari then held him and told Edwin to open the cash register. When he replied that he was not a personnel of the 7-Eleven Convenience Store, Joemari ordered him to remain lying on the floor.
[40]
Rommel, a pump attendant at the Petron Gasoline Station, Commonwealth Avenue, narrated that between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. of July 28, 1999, while he was at the gasoline station with Robert Laggua (
Robert, 
a gasoline boy) and Randy Azurin (
Randy, 
the station's cashier), a passenger jeepney arrived and proceeded to the third lane. While he was loading the jeepney with fuel, he recognized appellant Audie - who was seated beside the driver - and saw eight (8) other persons inside the jeepney. After the driver paid him P100.00, two of the jeepney's passengers approached him; one of them, FO1 dela Cruz, pointed a gun at him, hit him on the nape, got back the P100.00 bill, and asked him where the station's money was hidden. He told FO1 dela Cruz that the money was in the second lane's vault. Diosdado and Joemari went to the second lane and took the money from there as well as other products.
[41]
 They also pointed a gun at Robert and Randy, brought them to the middle lane, and told them not to run or report to the police. Thereafter, they all returned to the jeepney and left.
[42]
Corazon, general supervisor of Petron Gasoline Station, confirmed that the robbers took P8,000.00 and assorted Petron products worth P7,000.00 from the gas station.
[43]
P/Insp. Salamat, PNP ballistician, testified that of the five (5) firearms submitted to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination, three (3) were found to be positive, namely: caliber .38 Armscor revolver with Serial No. 51952; caliber .38 Armscor revolver with Serial No. 790006; and caliber .38 revolver Protector with Serial No. BR02982744. He explained that the term "positive" meant that the "tested fired bullet coming from the three firearms revealed the same individual characteristics as the evidence bullet recovered at the crime scene and extracted from the cadavers."
[44]
The appellants gave a different version of the events.
As summarized by the RTC, Dominador, Robert, and Eduardo testified that -
DOMINADOR RECEPCION, EDUARDO PALACPAC and ROBERT ALFONSO, who introduced themselves as co-workers at Greenwoods, Cainta, Rizal, claimed that in the early morning of July 28, 1999, Dominador Recepcion and Eduardo Palacpac were at their worksite while Robert Alfonso was in Bulacan.

Bernardo claimed that in the evening of July 28 1999, he went to the house of FO1 dela Cruz to attend the wake of the latter's cousin. According to him, he knew FO1 dela Cruz because he had been introduced to him by Joemari. When he arrived at the house at around 8:00 p.m., FO1 dela Cruz was not yet there; however, he saw Alfredo and Audie. While waiting for FO1 dela Cruz, he fell asleep.
[49]
 In the early morning of the next day, he was roused from sleep when the police arrived and arrested him and the other people inside the house. They were brought to the Paniqui Police Station where their pictures were taken. Thereafter, they were taken to the PAOCTF Office at Camp Crame on board a helicopter.

Barangay
 Pansi, Tarlac.
[51]
 At around 1:00 p.m., his uncle Dominador, together with Robert and Eduardo, came to see him and invited him to work with them in Cainta. He told them that he would first go to the house of his cousin FO1 dela Cruz. They proceeded together to FO1 dela Cruz's house but he was not there. When FO1 dela Cruz arrived, he introduced Dominador, Alfonso and Eduardo to him. Afterwards, they slaughtered a dog and drank four (4) bottles of gin. Afterwards, Audie and Alfredo arrived, followed by Bernardo; the three (3) then joined them in drinking gin. Thereafter, he, together with FO1 dela Cruz, Roberto, Dominador and Eduardo went to the wake of FO1 dela Cruz' cousin. They returned to the house at around 1:00 a.m. and slept there. They were roused from their sleep when the police arrived and ordered them to come out. When they came out, the police ordered them to undress and lie face down on the ground. Thereafter, they were handcuffed and brought to the Paniqui Police Station. After General Lacson arrived, they were placed on board a helicopter and taken to Camp Crame.
[52]
On cross-examination, he admitted that on November 22, 1999, he tried to escape from police custody by jumping out of the Jail Management and Penology vehicle, but explained that he only followed Diosdado, Bernardo and a certain Kasoy - who all jumped out of the vehicle first.
[53]
The RTC summarized the testimonies of Alfredo and Audie in this manner:
ALFREDO BARACAS and AUDIE DONA were neighbors in Pasig City and both claimed that on the early morning of July 28, 1999, they were in Villacorta, Mabini, Pangasinan because the grandmother of Baracas was dying. They further narrated that at past 11:30 o'clock of that day, while they were preparing to go back to Manila, Baracas told Audie Dona that they would pass by Tarlac to see his cousin, Joemari de los Reyes, because the latter had plenty of vegetables and fish and he wanted to bring some to Manila;
[54]
 that at past noontime, they arrived at the place of Joemari but he was not there; that his aunt said that he was at the fishpond so they followed him there; that later, they went to the house of FO1 Felipe de la Cruz where they saw Joemari de los Reyes with FO1 de la Cruz, Roberto Alfonso, Dominador Recepcion and Eduardo Palacpac; that after the group had finished their drinks, they left to attend a wake;

The defense presented Jose and FO2 Sambo as additional witnesses.
Jose, a 36 year-old farmer from Ramos, Tarlac, narrated that at around 7:00 p.m. of July 27, 1999, while he was at the wake of Marcial de Vera, FO1 dela Cruz arrived. He and FO1 dela Cruz left the next day at around 4:00 a.m. When he returned to the wake at around 8:00 p.m. on July 28, 1999, he again saw FO1 dela Cruz. On cross-examination, he admitted that FO1 dela Cruz is his cousin.
[60]
FO2 Sambo testified that in the morning of July 29, 1999, while he was at the Office of the Fire Marshal, his brother informed him that FO1 dela Cruz was under detention at the Paniqui Police Station. He went to Paniqui to confirm the information and reported his findings to the provincial office. Afterwards, the Bureau of Fire Protection directed him to investigate the involvement of FO1 dela Cruz in the robbery. After interviewing FO1 dela Cruz and several other people (including the parents of FO1 dela Cruz, his live-in partner, and the vice-mayor of Ramos, Tarlac), he concluded that FO1 dela Cruz was not involved in the recent robbery/hold-up and was not a coddler of criminals.
[61]
As a side development, Diosdado, Alfredo, Bernardo, Joemari, Dominador and Robert escaped from their escorts after their hearing on November 22, 1999 while on their way back to the Quezon City Jail. Joemari, Dominador, Alfredo, and Robert were immediately apprehended; Diosdado was fatally wounded and later died, while Bernardo still remains at large.

SO ORDERED.
[63]
The RTC denied the appellants' motion for reconsideration in its resolution
[64]
 of April 17, 2000.
The case was brought to this Court on automatic appeal in light of the penalty imposed, but we remanded it to the CA for intermediate appellate review pursuant to our ruling in 
People v. Mateo
.
[65]
The CA, in a decision
[66]
 dated March 15, 2005, fully affirmed the RTC decision.
In their brief,
[67]
 the appellants argued that the RTC erred -
in imposing the penalty of death upon them because treachery and abuse of superior strength were not proven; and
in finding all the accused, even those who did not take active part, equally liable for the crime of robbery with homicide.
The twin issues for our resolution are: 
(a) whether the appellants' guilt of the crimes charged was proven beyond reasonable doubt; and 
(b) if they are guilty, whether the trial court imposed the correct penalties and awarded the proper civil indemnities.
THE COURT'S RULING
We deny the appeal, but modify the penalties imposed and the amount of the awarded indemnities.
Sufficiency of the Prosecution Evidence
I.   Criminal Case No. Q-99-85788 (Robbery in Band)
A reading of the cited errors reveals that the appellants no longer contest their conviction for robbery in band. Nevertheless, since an appeal opens the whole case for review, we deem it necessary to review the appellants' conviction as well as the corresponding penalty imposed and the civil indemnities awarded.
The elements of the crime of robbery under Article 293
[68]
 of the Revised Penal Code are: (a) the unlawful taking (b) of personal property belonging to another (c) with intent to gain, and (d) with violence against or intimidation of person or force upon things. Under Article 296 of the same Code, "when more than three armed malefactors take part in the commission of robbery, it shall be deemed to have been committed by a band."
[69]
In the present case, the prosecution witnesses, at one time or another during the hearing, testified that Joemari, Bernardo, Diosdado and FO1 dela Cruz were all armed. However, we cannot recognize the commission of robbery by a band as an aggravating circumstance since this circumstance was not specifically alleged in the body of the Information. Section 8, Rule 110 of the 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure provides that the information or complaint must state the designation of the offense given by the statute and specify its qualifying and generic aggravating circumstances, thus:
Section 8. Designation of the offense.- The complaint or information 
shall
 state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and 
specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances
.
 If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.
Other than on this aspect of the case, we find the trial court's factual findings and conclusions in 
Criminal Case No. Q-99-85788
 to be correct. As the trial court found, the witnesses were straightforward in their account of the robbery that occurred at Petron Gasoline Station along Commonwealth, Quezon City, and never wavered in pointing to the appellants as the perpetrators.
Ruben, the driver of the vehicle the appellants used and who saw the robberies from the start to its bloody end, positively and with full details identified in his testimony of September 28, 1999 the appellants Robert, Eduardo, Audie, Bernardo, Dominador, Joemari, Alfredo, and Diosdado as the robbers. At gunpoint, they boarded his jeepney in Monumento; ordered him to refuel at Petron Gas Station in Commonwealth, Quezon City and robbed this establishment; and then ordered him to stop at the 7-Eleven Convenience Store along Mindanao and Tandang Sora Avenue for another robbery.
[70]
 Rommel, in his testimony of October 21, 1999, corroborated the testimony of Ruben and likewise gave his own details of how the robbery was committed. He identified Audie, FO1 dela Cruz, Diosdao and Joemari as the passengers of the jeepney whom he recognized.
[71]
These testimonies, which we considered in light of the appellants' defenses discussed below, more than amply constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants are guilty of the crime of robbery as charged.
II. 
Criminal Case No. Q-99-85787 (Robbery with Homicide)
There is robbery with homicide when a homicide is committed either by reason, or on occasion, of the robbery.
[72]
 To sustain a conviction for robbery with homicide, the prosecution must prove the following elements: (1) the taking of personal property belonging to another; (2) with intent to gain; (3) with the use of violence or intimidation against a person; and (4) on the occasion or by reason of the robbery, the crime of homicide, as used in its generic sense, was committed.
[73]
 A conviction requires certitude that the robbery is the main purpose
 
and objective of the malefactor and the killing is merely incidental to the robbery.
[74]
 The intent to rob must precede the taking of human life but the killing may occur before, during or after the robbery.
[75]
In the case before us, the prosecution proved that the appellants' original intention was to rob the 7-Eleven Convenience Store. A careful examination of the testimonies of the various prosecution witnesses, all of them cited above, reveals the following facts showing the appellants' intent: appellants Joemarie, Bernardo and Robert entered the 7-Eleven Convenience Store pretending to be customers; witness Kuraishi entered the store and met appellant Bernardo, who was carrying a gun; Elmer, who went out of his car to follow Kuraishi, was shot in the chest by Diosdado; appellant FO1 dela Cuz fired at the security guard, Nestor, through the glass door but missed; Nestor exchanged shots with FO1 dela Cruz; Joemari pulled down Edwin and took his wallet and watch; Diosdado peeped through the glass panel of the 7-Eleven Convenience Store, shot Nestor and entered the store; Joemari dragged Edwin towards the counter and told him to open the cash register; Diosdado went outside the store, approached the two (2) taxis parked in front of King Dimsum and held up the drivers; FO1 dela Cruz entered the store, dragged the cashier, Rose, towards the backroom and asked who kept the keys of the cash register; Joemarie, Bernardo, Robert and FO1 dela Cruz took the cash register and went back to their companions who were waiting inside the jeepney; thereafter, appellants proceeded to Paniqui, Tarlac.
From the foregoing, the overriding intention of the appellants could not but be to rob the 7-Eleven Convenience Store; the killings were merely incidental, resulting by reason or on the occasion of the robbery. Nestor was killed because he was the man who would have resisted the robbery; Elmer was killed because he simply happened to be there as the robbery was taking place.
Aside from the testimony of Ruben,
[76]
 other witnesses positively identified the appellants as the persons who went to the 7-Eleven Convenience Store on that fateful morning of July 28, 1999. 
Joel
 (the 7-Eleven Convenience Store Supervisor), in his testimony on September 2, 1999, pointed to appellants Joemari and FO1 dela Cruz as the persons who entered and robbed the 7-Eleven Convenience Store.
[77]
 
 
Joselito 
(the Assistant Lead Clerk of the 7-Eleven Convenience Store), in his testimony of September 6, 1999, corroborated the testimony of Joel and added that he saw appellant Robert inside the 7-Eleven Convenience Store.
[78]
 
Kuraishi
 (the companion of Elmer), in his September 9, 1999 testimony, confirmed the presence of appellant Bernardo inside the 7-Eleven Convenience Store.
[79]
 
Allan
 (the cook of King Dimsum), for his part, positively identified Diosdado as the one who fatally shot Elmer.
[80]
 Finally, 
Edwin
 (the delivery boy), confirmed the presence of appellant Joemari inside the 7-Eleven Convenience Store, and identified appellant FO1 dela Cruz as the person who fired shots at the store's security guard.
[81]
Denial and Alibi
In stark contrast with the prosecution's case are the appellants' weak and uncorroborated defenses. They interposed alibi and denial to support their claim of innocence.
Robert, Eduardo and Dominador all alleged that they went to Tarlac in the afternoon of July 28, 1999 to recruit Joemari as a worker in the construction site where they were working. When they reached the house of Joemari's aunt, they claimed to have seen Audie and Alfredo. This is contrary to the claim of Audie and Alfredo who claimed to have seen them only at the house of FO1 dela Cruz.
The testimonies of Audie and Alfredo were likewise full of inconsistencies: Alfredo claimed that they arrived at Tarlac at past 2:00 p.m. of July 28, 1999, while Audie alleged that they arrived at noontime; Alfredo stated that they saw Joemari at the house of FO1 dela Cruz and then went to the fishpond to drink, while Audie claimed that they first went to the fishpond to have some drinks and then proceeded to the house of FO1 dela Cruz where they saw Joemari.
Joemari insisted that he was sleeping in the house of his aunt in Tarlac at the time of the robbery. His story, however, remains uncorroborated. Bernardo, for his part, maintained that he went to Tarlac on July 28, 1999 at 3:00 p.m. to attend the wake of FO1 dela Cruz's cousin. Incredibly, he did not know the name of the deceased nor could he remember the name of the person who informed him of the death of the deceased.
FO1 dela Cruz, a central figure in the robbery, denied knowing any of the appellants (except his cousin Joemari) before July 29, 1999; surprisingly, he allowed all the appellants to sleep in his house.
We have repeatedly held that for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time the crime was committed, but that it was likewise impossible for him to be at the 
locus criminis 
or its immediate vicinity at the time of the alleged crime. Where there is the least chance for the accused to be present at the crime scene, the defense of alibi must fail.
[82]
In this case, the appellants claimed to have gone to Tarlac in the 
afternoon
 of July 28, 1999. However, they could not account for their whereabouts at past 12:00 a.m. on July 28, 1999 when the crime was committed. The appellants failed to prove that it was physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime at the approximate time of its commission.
The appellants' denial must likewise fail in light of the positive identification and declarations made by the prosecution witnesses. These witnesses testified in a straightforward and categorical manner regarding the identities of the malefactors. They did not waver despite the grueling and extensive questions fielded by the defense; they likewise remained consistent and steadfast despite the defense counsel's rigid questioning.
Courts generally view the defenses of denial and alibi with disfavor on account of the facility with which an accused can concoct them to suit his defense. As both evidence are negative and self-serving, they cannot attain more credibility than the testimonies of prosecution witnesses who testify clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on the various aspects of the crime committed.
[83]
 Among such positive evidence are the paraffin tests conducted on the appellants which revealed that four (4) of them - Joemari, Dominador, Diosdado and FO1 dela Cruz - were positive for gunpowder nitrate. In addition, the ballistic examination on the gun owned by Diosdado showed that the bullets recovered from the body of Elmer were fired from his gun.
On the whole, we view the evidence against accused-appellants to be overwhelming. We find no reason to deviate from the findings of the trial court in the absence of facts or circumstances of real weight that might have been overlooked or misapprehended.
[84]
 The trial court had the unique opportunity of observing firsthand the witnesses as they testified and were cross-examined, and it was therefore in the best position to assess whether these witnesses were telling the truth or not. The substance of the testimonies for the prosecution were as the trial court found and intrinsically merits full faith and credence. The defense, on the other hand, provided no facts and circumstances of weight and substance sufficient to cast doubt on the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses.
[85]
The presence of conspiracy
Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. Conspiracy may be inferred from the acts of the accused before, during, and after the commission of the crime which indubitably point to and are indicative of a joint purpose, concert of action and community of interest.
[86]
 For conspiracy to exist, it is not required that there be an agreement for an appreciable period prior to the occurrence; it is sufficient that at the time of the commission of the offense, the malefactors had the same purpose and were united in its execution.
[87]
From the circumstances obtaining in this case, it cannot be doubted that the appellants acted in conspiracy in committing the crimes charged. The appellants were together in the jeepney when it stopped at Petron Gasoline station and then at the 7-Eleven Convenience Store. Afterwards, they were still together in the jeepney when it went to Tarlac. From the time they announced a robbery at Petron to the moment they entered the 7-Eleven Convenience Store and shot the store's security guard, up to the time they fled towards Tarlac, there can be no other conclusion than that they hatched a criminal scheme, synchronized their acts for unity in its execution, and aided each other for its consummation.
[88]
When conspiracy or action in concert to achieve a criminal design is shown, the act of one is the act of all the other conspirators, and the precise extent or modality of participation of each of them becomes secondary.
[89]
Corollarily, the rule is well-established that whenever homicide has been committed as a consequence of or on the occasion of a robbery, all those who took part as principals in the robbery will also be held guilty as principals of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide although they did not actually take part in the homicide, unless it clearly appears that they endeavored to prevent the homicide. In the present case, it has not been shown that the appellants tried to prevent the shooting of the two (2) victims. Hence, their cooperative acts toward their common criminal objective render them equally liable as conspirators.
[90]
The Proper Penalties
For the crime of simple robbery
, Article 294, paragraph 5, prescribes the penalty of 
prision correccional
 in its maximum period to 
prision mayor
 in its medium period. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and in the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the maximum penalty to be imposed shall be taken from the medium of the imposable penalty which is 
prision mayor
 minimum and whose range is six (6) years and one (1) day to eight (8) years, following Article 64(1)
[91]
 of the Revised Penal Code. The minimum, on the other hand, shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree which is 
arresto mayor
 in its maximum period to 
prision correccional
 in its medium period, whose range is from four (4) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2) months, in accordance with Article 61(4)
[92]
 of the Revised Penal Code.
For the crime of robbery with homicide
, Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659, reads:
Art. 294. - 
Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons.
 - 
 Penalties. 
- Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer:
The penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed, or when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation or arson. x x x x
In convicting the appellants of the crime of robbery with homicide, the courts 
a quo
 appreciated treachery. There is treachery when the following essential elements are present, 
viz
: (a) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (b) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, methods or forms of attack employed by him. The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by an aggressor on the unsuspecting victim, depriving the latter of any chance to defend himself and thereby ensuring its commission without risk to himself. Treachery may also be appreciated even if the victim was warned of the danger to his life where he was defenseless and unable to flee at the time of the infliction of the 
coup de grace
.
[93]
In the present case, the evidence clearly shows that as Joemari, Bernardo and Robert entered the 7-Eleven Convenience Store, FO1 dela Cruz already positioned himself outside the store's glass door and prepared to shoot Nestor to ensure lack of resistance to their robbery plans. While Nestor was exchanging shots with FO1 dela Cruz, Diosdado peeped through the glass panel and fired at Nestor - fatally hitting him. Under these facts, we find it clear that the appellants prepared to kill the victim in a manner that would ensure the execution of the crime or make it impossible or hard for the victim to defend himself; he was immediately shot at from outside the store, with a fallback position in case this first attempt to immobilize him failed.
We rule, however, that the killing of the other victim, Elmer, was not attended by treachery as there was no evidence that Diosdado had resolved to shoot him prior to the moment of the killing, or that his death was the result of premeditation, calculation or reflection.
Considering the presence of the aggravating circumstance of treachery with no attendant mitigating circumstance, the trial court correctly sentenced the appellant to suffer the death penalty, conformably with Article 63, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code.
[94]
 In view, however, of the enactment on June 24, 2006 of Republic Act No. 9346 which 
prohibits the imposition of death penalty in the 
Philippines
, we reduce the penalty of death to 
reclusion perpetua
 without eligibility for parole.
[95]
Civil Liability
Criminal Case No. Q-99-85788
The RTC ordered the appellants to pay only P8,000.00, or the amount of the cash taken from the gasoline station. However, the evidence on record reveals that assorted Petron fuel products amounting to P7,000.00 were also taken. Hence, we order the appellants to likewise restitute these items or to pay their monetary value, if restitution cannot be made.
Criminal Case No. Q-99-85787
For the death of Elmer and Nestor, we sustain the award of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity ordered by the RTC and affirmed by the CA. The award for civil indemnity is mandatory and is granted to the heirs of the victim without need of proof other than the commission of the crime. The amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity is awarded if the crime is qualified by circumstances warranting the imposition of the death penalty. Though the penalty imposed on appellant was reduced to 
reclusion perpetua
, the civil indemnity award remains at P75,000.00.
[96]
The award of P500,000.00 and P100,000.00 as moral damages to the heirs of Elmer and Nestor, respectively, is not in accordance with recent jurisprudence.
[97]
 We accordingly reduce the amounts to P50,000.00.
Indemnity for the loss of earning capacity is determinable under established jurisprudence based on the net earning capacity of the victim computed under the formula:
Net Earning Capacity = 2/3 
x
 (80 less the age of the victim at the time of death) 
x
 (Gross Annual Income less the Reasonable and Necessary Living Expenses)
The records show that Elmer's annual gross income was P136,800.00 computed from his monthly rate of P11,400.00. His reasonable and necessary living expenses are estimated at 50% of this gross income, leaving a balance of P68,400.00. His life expectancy, on the other hand, is assumed to be 2/3 of age 80 less 38, his age at the time of death. Applied to the above formula, these data yield the net earning capacity loss of P1,915,200.00. The RTC award must thus be increased to this amount.
In the absence of supporting evidence, we cannot award loss of earning capacity to Nestor's heirs.
The award of exemplary damages is justified by the duly proven qualifying circumstance of treachery. The lower courts, however, awarded exemplary damages to the heirs of Elmer and Nestor in the amounts of P500,000.00 and P50,000.00, respectively. To conform with prevailing jurisprudence, we reduce these amounts to P25,000.00 for each set of heirs.
[98]
The RTC awarded P138,070.00 as actual damages to the heirs of Elmer. It appears that out of this amount, only P61,635.00 was supported by receipts. The difference in the amounts was based solely on the submissions by Elmer's widow. For one too be entitled to actual damages, it is necessary to prove the actual amount of loss with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof and the best evidence obtainable by the injured party.
[99]
 Hence, we reduce the awarded actual damages to P61,635.00.
We note that the RTC did not award actual damages to the heirs of Nestor for lack of evidence. In 
People v. Abrazaldo
,
[100]
 we held that where the amount of the actual damages cannot be determined because of the absence of supporting receipts but entitlement is shown under the facts of the case, temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00 may be awarded. Thus, in lieu of actual damages, we award temperate damages of P25,000.00 to the heirs of Nestor.
We affirm the order of the RTC to restitute the amount of P84,060.00 to the 7-Eleven Convenience Store. This was the amount taken in the robbery as proven by evidence.  We delete, however, the interest that the RTC imposed.
WHEREFORE
, in light of all the foregoing, We hereby AFFIRM the March 15, 2005 decision of the CA in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 00570 with the following
