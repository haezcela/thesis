PERALTA, J.:


This is a petition for review on 
certiorari
[1]
 assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated August 17, 2006 of the Court of Appeals (
CA
) in CA-G.R. SP No. 00204-MIN, and the Resolution
[3]
 dated July 4, 2007, which denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.
Petitioners, except for Mark Brazil and Nestor Macapayag, are members of the Miarayon, Lapok, Lirongan, Talaandig Tribal Association (
MILALITTRA
), or Talaandig tribe, who claimed to have been living since birth on the land located at 
Barangay
 Miarayon, Talakag, Bukidnon, Mindanao, which they inherited from their forefathers.
On the other hand, respondents, represented by attorney-in-fact Ramon Aberasturi, claimed to be the lawful owners and possessor of an unregistered parcel of agricultural land (Lot No. 7367 Cad 630-D), with an area of 105.7361 hectares, which appears to be located within the ancestral domain of the Talaandig tribe.
On March 3, 2004, respondents filed a Petition for 
Accion Reivindicatoria,
 with Prayer for the Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction with Damages
[4]
 (
original complaint for accion reivindicatoria
) against petitioners before the Regional Trial Court of Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon (
RTC
). Docketed as Civil Case No. 04-03-01, the petition was raffled off to Branch 11.
On March 20, 2004, petitioners Macapayag and Brazil filed their Answer, alleging that respondents have no cause of action against them.
On March 23, 2004, the rest of the petitioners filed their Motion to Dismiss, alleging that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the case. Petitioners alleged that with the advent of Republic Act No. (
RA
) 8371, otherwise known as the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act (
IPRA
), they, together with the rest of the tribe members, assisted the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (
NCIP
) in the processing, validation, and delineation of their Ancestral Domain claim in May 2003. On July 25, 2003, Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (
CADT
) No. R-10-TAL-0703-0010 was issued by virtue of NCIP 
En Banc
 Resolution No. 08-02003 to the Talaandig tribe over its ancestral domain in Talakag, Bukidnon, containing an area of 11,105.5657 hectares. On October 30, 2003, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo awarded the said CADT to the Talaandig tribe. As awardees of a CADT, petitioners argued that NCIP has exclusive and original jurisdiction over the case, as the subject matter concerns a dispute and controversy over an ancestral land/domain of Indigenous Cultural Communities (
ICCs
)/Indigenous Peoples (
IPs
).
On July 1, 2004, the NCIP through Atty. Melanie Pimentel, filed a Motion to Refer the Case to the Regional Hearing Office-National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (
RHO-NCIP
), alleging that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter.
On July 5, 2004, respondents filed a Motion to Amend and Supplement Complaint from Accion Reivindicatoria to one for "Injunction, Damages, and Other Relief," with the attached Amended and Supplemental Complaint
[5]
 (
amended complaint for injunction
). On July 30, 2004, petitioners filed an Opposition thereto.
On August 1, 2004, petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended and Supplemental Complaint, alleging that the RTC had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case and to issue a writ of injunction therein.
On August 10, 2004, the RTC issued an Order granting the Motion to Amend and Supplement Complaint, and declared petitioners' Motion to Refer the Case to the RHO-NCIP and Motion to Dismiss moot and academic as a consequence of the grant of the said motion to amend and supplement complaint.
On August 17, 2004, petitioners filed a Manifestation praying for an ocular inspection of the disputed land to determine the last, actual, peaceable, uncontested status of the area.
On August 25, 2004, petitioners filed another Motion to Refer the Case to the RHO-NCIP and Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint.
On September 14, 2004, respondents filed their Opposition and Motion for Judgment by Default.
On February 14, 2005, the RTC issued an Order
[6]
 resolving all pending incidents before it, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, defendant's [herein petitioners'] motion to refer the case to the RHO-NCIP and its manifestation for an ocular inspection are hereby denied for being bereft of merit. Further, defendants [petitioners], except Macapayag and Brazil, are hereby declared in default for their failure to file their Answer to the Amended Complaint. Accordingly, let this case, as against defendants Macapayag and Brazil, be called for pre-trial and 
ex-parte
 presentation of evidence as against the rest of defendants [petitioners] on 
May 2, 2005
 at 
9:00 o'clock in the morning.
 Furthermore, the injunctive writ prayed for by the plaintiffs is hereby GRANTED for being meritorious. Accordingly, defendants [petitioners], their agents and privies, or any other or all persons acting for and in their behalves, are hereby ordered to observe, maintain and preserve the 
status quo
 subject of the action and/or the relation between the parties in order to protect the rights of the plaintiffs while the case is pending in court and to cease and desist from performing any acts that in one way or another contravene the tenor of this order, while awaiting final determination of the instant suit or until further orders of this court. Furthermore, to answer for whatever damage that defendants [petitioners] may sustain by reason of this injunction order if the court should finally decide that plaintiffs [respondents] are not entitled to the relief it prayed for, plaintiffs [respondents] are hereby directed to put up a bond in the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P100,000.00) executed in favor of the party enjoined.
SO ORDERED.
[7]
On April 12, 2005, petitioners filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for 
Certiorari 
and Prohibition with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order.
On August 17, 2006, the CA rendered a Decision affirming the RTC's February 14, 2005 Order, which in turn denied the referral of the case to the NCIP, the dispositive portion of which states:
WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the petition is hereby partly GRANTED. The assailed Order dated February 14, 2005 is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that the order of default against petitioners, except Macapayag and Brazil, is hereby LIFTED.
SO ORDERED.
[8]
The CA ruled that the RTC correctly granted the amendment of the complaint and properly refused to refer the case to the RHO-NCIP. Based on the allegations of both original complaint [
accion reivindicatoria
] and amended complaint [injunction], the CA found that the subject matter of both complaints is well within the jurisdiction of the RTC. The CA noted that the only substantial amendment made was with regard to the nature of the action which originally was one of 
accion reivindicatoria
 and then changed to one for damages. And except for some amendments as to petitioners' alleged violent acts and the prayer for declaration of their title to the subject property, the rest of the amended complaint was basically the same as the original one, including the reliefs prayed for by respondents. Anent the writ of preliminary injunction, the CA held that the RTC's assailed February 14, 2005 Order is self-explanatory as to why the issuance of the same was proper considering the circumstances of the case.
On July 4, 2007, the CA denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration of its August 17, 2006 Decision.
Hence, this appeal on 
certiorari 
raising the following issues:
I. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT 
A QUO
 OVER A COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTION INVOLVING AN ANCESTRAL DOMAIN OF THE TALAANDIGS.
II. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE RESOLUTION OF THE COURT 
A QUO
 ALLOWING THE AMENDMENT OF THE COMPLAINT, THE SOLE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO CONFER JURISDICTION ON THE LOWER COURT.
III. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RESOLVING THAT EVIDENCE MUST BE PRESENTED BEFORE THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT WHEN IN THE ORIGINAL ACTION FOR SPECIAL CIVIL ACTION FOR 
CERTIORARI
 BEFORE IT, THE COURT 
A QUO
 HAS ADMITTED THAT A CADT WAS ISSUED IN FAVOR OF PETITIONERS.
[9]
On the first issue, petitioners contend that the RTC has no jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 04-03-0 for Injunction, Damages and other Relief, because the 105.7361-hectare land claimed by respondents is undisputedly within the ancestral domain of the Talaandig tribe over which a CADT has already been issued. Petitioners insist that, even granting that the case is purely a personal action, the NCIP has exclusive and original jurisdiction over it as it concerns a claim and dispute involving rights of ICCs/IPs over their ancestral domain.
On the second issue, petitioners argue that the amendment of the complaint from 
accion reivindicatoria
 to injunction with damages was clearly meant to oust the NCIP of its jurisdiction over the case and confer it on the RTC by concealing the real issue in the case, which is the parties' conflicting claims over the 105.7361-hectare land in Miarayon, Talakag Bukidnon. According to petitioners, the cause of action in the complaint for 
accion reivindicatoria
 is the claim of ownership and recovery of possession of the said land which is undisputedly found within the Talaandig tribe's ancestral domain covered by CADT No. R10-TAL-0703-0010; hence, a claim within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the NCIP. Petitioners contend that respondents amended the complaint to one for injunction to downplay the real issue which is the dispute over a land that is within the Talaandig tribe's ancestral domain, and mainly capitalized on the acts complained of, such as harassment, threats, acts of terrorism, among others, supposedly committed against respondents.
On the third issue, petitioners fault the CA in ruling that whether the complaint is one for Injunction or 
Accion Reivindicatoria,
 the RTC has jurisdiction because nowhere in respondents' original and amended complaints is it stated that petitioners were members of the ICCs or IPs and that the disputed property was part of their ancestral domain. Petitioners take exception to the rule that jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the allegations of the complaint, as strict adherence thereto would open the floodgates to the unscrupulous practice of litigants divesting the NCIP of jurisdiction by crafting their complaints in such a way as would confer jurisdiction on their court of choice. Petitioners contend that the literal averments of the complaint are not determinative of the jurisdiction over the subject matter where the actual issues are evidenced by subsequent pleadings; in certain cases, the real nature and character of the pleadings and issues are not merely found in the complaint, but also in the subsequent pleadings submitted by both parties. Petitioners stress that although the complaint banners the subject matter as one for injunction, the pleadings of respondents show that the subject matter is the conflicting ownership claims over the land. In fact, petitioners point out that the records of the case show that various pieces of evidence have been presented to prove that the dispute involves conflicting claims over a land covered by a CADT.
For their part, respondents contend that petitioners do not have legal capacity or standing and 
locus standi
 to file this petition, since they failed to make 
prima facie
 showing that they are members of IPs/ICCs, or that they were authorized to represent the Talaandig tribe. Respondents insist that based on the allegations in their amended complaint for injunction and damages, the RTC has jurisdiction over the subject matter which is a purely personal action and incapable of pecuniary estimation. Respondents assert that the real issue is whether or not petitioners are guilty of wrongful acts of violence, terrorism, destruction, intimidation, harassment, etc., to justify a permanent injunction and hold the latter liable for damages. Respondents also point out that petitioners cannot invoke protection under the IPRA 8731, because the conflict does not involve an ancestral domain and they (respondents) are not IPs so the condition precedent before bringing a dispute before the NCIP cannot be satisfied, 
i.e.,
 exhaustion of remedies under customary laws by the parties.
The petition has no merit.
On the procedural issue raised by respondents, the Court disagrees with their contention that petitioners do not have legal capacity or standing and 
locus standi
 to file the petition, for failure to show that they are members of IPs/ICCs, or that they are authorized to represent the Talaandig tribe.
Locus standi
 is defined as a right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question. In private suits, standing is governed by the "real parties in interest" rule found in Section 2,
[10]
 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. Such concept of real party-in-interest is adapted in Section 2,
[11]
 Rule VI of the 2014 Revised Rules of Procedure before the NCIP. That petitioners are the real parties in interest can be gleaned from the Entry of Appearance with Motion to Refer the Case to the Regional Hearing Office of the NCIP
[12]
 filed by the NCIP Special Transition Team-Quick Response Unit (STRAT-QRU). The STRAT-QRU counsels alleged therein that the respondents' complaint for recovery of ownership (
accion reinvidicatoria
) sought to recover an unregistered real property situated in Miarayon, Bukidnon, from petitioners, all of whom are, with the exception of Nestor Macapayag and Mark Brazil, member-beneficiaries of CADT No. R10-TAL-0703-0010 issued by the NCIP in the name of the Talaandig Indigenous Peoples, located at Talakag, Province of Bukidnon. In support of their allegation, petitioners presented a certification
[13]
 that the disputed land is within the area covered by the same CADT, and the NCIP List of Beneficiaries of Talaandig Ancestral Domain of Miarayon, Lirongan, Lapok, San Miguel, Talakag, Bukidnon.
[14]
 In contrast, respondents failed to submit any evidence to dispute petitioners' claim that they are members of the Talaandig Tribe. Hence, respondents' contention that petitioners have no legal standing to file the petition, is without merit.
In resolving the pivotal issue of which between the RTC and the NCIP has jurisdiction over the respondents' amended complaint, foremost in the Court's mind is the principle in "that jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint which comprise a concise statement of the ultimate facts constituting the plaintiffs cause of action. The nature of an action, as well as which court or body has jurisdiction over it, is determined based on the allegations contained in the complaint of the plaintiff, irrespective of whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon all or some of the claims asserted therein. The averments in the complaint and the character of the relief sought are the ones to be consulted. Once vested by the allegations in the complaint, jurisdiction also remains vested irrespective of whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon all or some of the claims asserted therein."
[15]
Under Section 19 of B.P. 129, as amended (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980), the RTC shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction in all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation, and in all civil actions which involve title to, possession of, real property or any interest therein where the assessed value of the property or interest therein exceeds Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) or, in civil actions in Metro Manila, where such assessed value exceeds Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00).
On the other hand, the NCIP's jurisdiction is defined under Section 66 of the IPRA as follows:
Sec. 66. 
Jurisdiction of the NCIP
. - The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over 
all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs
; Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP.
[16]
On the matter of NCIP's jurisdiction and of procedures for enforcement of rights, NCIP Administrative Order No. 1, 1998, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (
NCIP-IRR
) of the IPRA, Rule IX, Section 1 states:
Section 1. 
Primacy of Customary Law
. - All conflicts related to the ancestral domain and lands, involving ICCs/IPs, such as but not limited to the conflicting claims and boundary disputes, shall be resolved by the concerned parties through the application of customary laws in the area where the disputed ancestral domain or land is located.
All conflicts related to the ancestral domain or lands where one of the parties is non-ICC/IP or where the dispute could not be resolved through customary law shall be heard and adjudicated in accordance with the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedure before the NCIP to be adopted hereafter.
All decisions of the NCIP may be brought on Appeal by Petition for Review to the Court of Appeals within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the Order or Decision.
[17]
In line with Section 69 of the IPRA on the NCIP's quasi-judicial power to promulgate rules and regulations governing the hearing and disposition of cases filed before it, the NCIP issued Administrative Circular No. 1-03 dated April 9, 2003, known as the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedure (
NCIP Rules
), which reiterates its jurisdiction over claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs and enumerates the actions that may be brought before it. Section 5, Rule III, of the NCIP Rules provides for the jurisdiction of the NCIP-RHO:
Sec. 5. 
Jurisdiction of the NCIP
. - The NCIP through its Regional Hearing Offices shall exercise jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs and all cases pertaining to the implementation, enforcement, and interpretation of the IPRA 8371, including but not limited to the following:
(1) Original and Exclusive Jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Officer (RHO):
a. Cases involving disputes, controversies over ancestral lands/domains of ICCs/IPs;
b. Cases involving violations of the requirement of free and prior and informed consent of ICC/IPs;
c. Actions for enforcement of decisions of ICCs/IPs involving violations of customary laws or desecration of ceremonial sites, sacred places, or rituals;
d. Actions for redemption/reconveyance under Section 8(b) ofR.A. 8371; and
e. Such other cases analogous to the foregoing.
(2) Original jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Officer:
a. Cases affecting property rights, claims of ownership, hereditary succession, and settlement of land disputes, between and among ICCs/IPs that have not been settled under customary laws; and
b. Actions for damages arising out of any violation of Republic Act No. 8371;
(3) Exclusive and Original Jurisdiction of the Commission:
a. Petition for cancellation of Certificate of Ancestral Domain Titles/Certificate of Ancestral Land Titles (CADTs/CALTs) alleged to have been fraudulently acquired by, and issued to, any person or community as provided for under Section 54 of R.A. 8371. Provided that such action is filed within one (1) year from the date of registration.
Anent the condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP under Section 66 of the IPRA, Sections 13 and 14, Rule IV of the NCIP Rules pertinently provide:
Section 13. 
Certification to File Action.
 - Upon the request of the proper party, members of the indigenous dispute settlement group or council of elders shall likewise issue a certification to file action before the NCIP. In giving due regard to customary laws, the certification may be in any form so long as it states in substance the failure of settlement notwithstanding the efforts made under customary law or traditional practices.
Section 14. 
Exceptions.
 - The certification shall not be required in the following cases:
a. Where one of the parties is a public or private corporation, partnership, association or juridical person or a public officer or employee and the dispute is in connection with the performance of his official functions;
b. Where one of the parties is non-IP/ICC or does not belong to the same IP/IC Community, except when he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders/Leaders;
c. Where the relief sought for in the complaint or petition seeks to prevent any grave, imminent and irreparable damage or injury that may result if not acted upon immediately; and
d. Where the Council of Elders/Leaders refuse to issue the necessary certification without justifiable reasons.
[18]
Having spelled out the jurisdictions conferred by law to the RTC and the NCIP over the subject matters of their respective cases, the Court now examines the allegations in the original and amended complaints to find out which tribunal may properly exercise jurisdiction over this case.
In their original complaint for 
accion reivindicatoria,
 respondents traced the provenance of their title over said land to one Mamerto Decano, a Chieftain of Talaandig tribe, by virtue of a Deed of Sale executed on July 27, 1957. They averred that, together with their predecessor-in-interest, they have religiously paid the real estate taxes thereon since 1957 and that they have been in physical, actual, open, prior, notorious, continuous, public and adverse possession of said land in the concept of owners for more than 50 years, even prior to June 12, 1945. They alleged that said land was declared alienable and disposable since August 3, 1927 per certification of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. They claimed that by means of fraud, stealth and surreptitious means, petitioners entered the said land, without permission and against the consent of the landowners, caused damages therein and harassed respondents by indiscriminately firing upon their farm workers. They added that petitioners continue such harassment by means of armed men frequenting the campsite and firing M-16 rifles at them during nighttime, causing great fear and threat.
Respondents prayed before the RTC for the following reliefs, among others: (1) to cause the preliminary injunction to be made permanent for the respondents to enjoy possession of their property, free from threats of physical harm, harassment and undue obstruction caused by petitioners; (2) to order petitioners to respect and not to harass, intimidate and cause trouble to the prior possession of respondents as the owners by virtue of right of title; (3) to order petitioners to pay moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, appearance fees and costs of suit; and (4) to declare respondents' title as having become a vested right, and as such entitled to all right and incident of an absolute owner.
In their amended complaint for injunction and damages, on the other hand, respondents further alleged that sometime in November 2003, petitioners harassed, intimidated, threatened, and fired high-powered rifles upon respondents' farm workers to drive them away from the land, without legal or justifiable reason. They added that, despite having hired private security guards to secure and protect their property, these violent incidents were followed by more acts of violence, lawlessness, harassment, terrorism to drive away respondents from the land which they claim to lawfully own and possess.
Respondents prayed before the RTC for the following reliefs: (1) to order petitioners and their representatives, to stop and refrain from committing acts of violence, destruction, assault and other forms of lawlessness and terrorism against respondents, and to maintain the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the 105-hectare land by respondents as an attribute of ownership; (2) to declare petitioners to have committed acts of violence, harassment, intimidation, destruction, assault and other forms of lawlessness against respondents, and to permanently order petitioners to stop and refrain from committing similar acts; and (3) to hold petitioners jointly and severally liable to pay respondents actual damages, moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, litigation expenses and treble costs.
After a perusal of the allegations and prayers in both original and amended complaints, the Court notes that respondents neither alleged therein that the parties are members of ICCs/IPs nor that the case involves a dispute or controversy over ancestral lands/domains of ICC/IPs. Rather, the allegations in respondents' original complaint make up for an 
accion reivindicatoria
, a civil action which involves an interest in a real property with an assessed value of P683,760.00, while the allegations in their amended complaint make out a case for injunction, a civil action which is incapable of pecuniary estimation. The Court therefore finds that the CA correctly ruled that the subject matter of the amended complaint based on allegations therein was within the jurisdiction of the RTC.
Meanwhile, contrary to petitioners' contention, the mere fact that this case involves members of ICCs/IPs and their ancestral land is not enough to for it to fall under the jurisdiction of the NCIP under Section 66 of the IPRA, to wit:
Sec. 66. 
Jurisdiction of the NCIP
. ~ The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs; Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP.
A careful review of Section 66 shows that the NCIP shall have jurisdiction over claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs only when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP. This can be gathered from the qualifying provision that "no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP."
The qualifying provision requires two conditions before such disputes may be brought before the NCIP, namely: (1) exhaustion of remedies under customary laws of the parties, and (2) compliance with condition precedent through the said certification by the Council of Elders/Leaders. This is in recognition of the rights of ICCs/IPs to use their own commonly accepted justice systems, conflict resolution institutions, peace building processes or mechanisms and other customary laws and practices within their respective communities, as may be compatible with the national legal system and with internationally recognized human rights.
[19]
Section 3 (f) of the IPRA defines customary laws as a body of written and/or unwritten rules, usages, customs and practices traditionally and continually recognized, accepted and observed by respective ICCs/IPs. From this restrictive definition, it can be gleaned that it is only when both parties to a case belong to the same ICC/IP that the abovesaid two conditions can be complied with. If the parties to a case belong to different ICCs/IPs which are recognized to have their own separate and distinct customary laws and Council of Elders/Leaders, they will fail to meet the abovesaid two conditions. The same holds true if one of such parties was a non-ICC/IP member who is neither bound by customary laws as contemplated by the IPRA nor governed by such council. Indeed, it would be violative of the principles of fair play and due process for those parties who do not belong to the same ICC/IP to be subjected to its customary laws and Council of Elders/Leaders.
Therefore, pursuant to Section 66 of the IPRA, the NCIP shall have jurisdiction over claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs only when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP. When such claims and disputes arise between or among parties who do not belong to the same ICC/IP,
 i.e.,
 parties belonging to different ICC/IPs or where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP, the case shall fall under the jurisdiction of the proper Courts of Justice, instead of the NCIP. In this case, while most of the petitioners belong to Talaandig Tribe, respondents do not belong to the same ICC/IP. Thus, even if the real issue involves a dispute over land which appear to be located within the ancestral domain of the Talaandig Tribe, it is not the NCIP but the RTC which shall have the power to hear, try and decide this case.
There are, however, exceptional cases where the NCIP shall still have jurisdiction over such claims and disputes even if the parties involved do not belong to the same ICC/IP, 
viz
.:
1. Cases under Sections 52 and 62 of the IPRA which contemplate a situation where a dispute over an ancestral domain involving parties who do not belong to the same, but to different ICCs/IPs, to wit:
SECTION 52. 
Delineation Process. 
â The identification and delineation of ancestral domains shall be done in accordance with the following procedures:
x x x x
h) Endorsement to NCIP. â Within fifteen (15) days from publication, and of the inspection process, the Ancestral Domains Office shall prepare a report to the NCIP endorsing a favorable action upon a claim that is deemed to have sufficient proof. However, if the proof is deemed insufficient, the Ancestral Domains Office shall require the submission of additional evidence: Provided, That the Ancestral Domains Office shall reject any claim that is deemed patently false or fraudulent after inspection and verification: Provided, further, That in case of rejection, the Ancestral Domains Office shall give the applicant due notice, copy furnished all concerned, containing the grounds for denial. The denial shall be appealable to the NCIP: 
Provided, furthermore, That in cases where there are conflicting claims 
among ICCs/IPs
 on the boundaries of ancestral domain claims, the Ancestral Domains Office shall cause the contending parties to meet and assist them in coming up with a preliminary resolution of the conflict, without prejudice to its full adjudication according to the section below.
x x x x
SECTION 62. 
Resolution of Conflicts
. â In cases of conflicting interest, where there are adverse claims within the ancestral domains as delineated in the survey plan, and which can not be resolved, 
the NCIP shall hear and decide, after notice to the proper parties, the disputes arising from the delineation of such ancestral domains: Provided, That if the dispute is 
between and/or among ICCs/IPs
 regarding the traditional boundaries of their respective ancestral domains, customary process shall be followed.
 The NCIP shall promulgate the necessary rules and regulations to carry out its adjudicatory functions: Provided, further, That any decision, order, award or ruling of the NCIP on any ancestral domain dispute or on any matter pertaining to the application, implementation, enforcement and interpretation of this Act may be brought for Petition for Review to the Court of Appeals within fifteen (15) days from receipt of a copy thereof.
[20]
2. Cases under Section 54 of the IPRA over fraudulent claims by parties who are not members of the same ICC/IP, to wit:
SECTION 54. 
Fraudulent Claims
. â The Ancestral Domains Office may, upon written request from the ICCs/IPs, review existing claims which have been fraudulently acquired by any person or community. 
Any claim found to be fraudulently acquired 
by, and issued to, any person or community
 may be cancelled by the NCIP after due notice and hearing of all parties concerned.
[21]
Considering the general rule that the jurisdiction of the NCIP under Section 66 of the IPRA covers only disputes and claims between and among members of the same ICCs/IPs involving their rights under the IPRA, as well as the basic administrative law principle that an administrative rule or regulation must conform, not contradict the provisions of the enabling law,
[22]
 the Court declares Rule IX, Section 1 of the IPRA-IRR,
[23]
 Rule III, Section 5
[24]
 and Rule IV, Sections 13 and 14 of the NCIP Rules
[25]
 as null and void insofar as they expand the jurisdiction of the NCIP under Section 66 of the IPRA to include such disputes where the parties do not belong to the same ICC/IP. As the Court held in 
Paduran v. DARAB
,
[26]
 "[J]urisdiction over a subject matter is conferred by the Constitution or the law and rules of procedure yield to substantive law. Otherwise stated, jurisdiction must exist as a matter of law.
[27]
 Only a statute can confer jurisdiction on courts and administrative agencies; rules of procedure cannot.
[28]
 In the abovesaid exceptional cases where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP or does not belong to the same ICC/IP, however, Rule IV, Section 14 of the NCIP Rules validly dispenses with the requirement of certification issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the failed attempt to settle the dispute according to the customary laws of the concerned ICC/IP.

Republic of the Philippines v. CA,

CONCURRING OPINION
VELASCO, JR., 
J
.:
I concur with the 
ponencia
 that the Regional Trial Court (RTC) has jurisdiction over the case. Both original and amended complaints, 
accion reivindicatoria
 and injunction, respectively, are incapable of pecuniary estimation; thus falling within the jurisdiction of the RTC. As correctly pointed out by the 
ponencia
, "jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint which comprise a concise statement of the ultimate facts constituting the plaintiffs cause of action."
[1]
 It cannot be acquired through a waiver or enlarged by the omission of the parties or conferred by the acquiescence of the court.
[2]
However, I would like to submit some points for consideration which run counter to the opinion of my esteemed colleague. It is my position that the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) has jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples (ICCs/IPs) regardless of whether or not they belong to the same IP/IC Community. This is pursuant to Section 66 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8371,
[3]
 otherwise known as "The Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997" (IPRA) as follows:
SECTION 66. Jurisdiction of the NCIP. â 
The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs
: Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP. (Emphasis supplied.)
A careful scrutiny of Section 66 of the IPRA would reveal that it is composed of three parts: (1) the NCIP has jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs; (2) the requirement of exhaustion of all remedies provided under the customary laws of the ICCs/IPs; and (3) a certification from the Council of Elders/Leaders as a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with NCIP.
The first part lays down the basis of jurisdiction of the NCIP. It can be gleaned from this part that the law is silent if the parties should belong to the same IP/IC Community. What the law only provides is that the NCIP has jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs.
The second part contains the 
proviso
 that should be followed before the NCIP acquires jurisdiction over the case. Said 
proviso
 states: "Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws."
The third part, on the other hand, refers to the certification from the Council of Elders/Leaders as a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with NCIP. This is in relation to the second part requiring the exhaustion of all remedies.
The second and third parts of the provision should not be interpreted as limiting the jurisdiction of the NCIP to claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs only when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP. The 
proviso
 only provides for a condition precedent. It is merely procedural and does not divest the NCIP of jurisdiction over parties not belonging to the same IP/IC Community. As provided in Section 14, Rule IV of the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedure
[4]
 of the NCIP (NCIP Rules), a party which does not belong to the same IP/IC Community is exempted from the requirement of certification, to wit:
Section 14. Exceptions. The certification shall not be required in the following cases:
 Where one of the parties is a public or private corporation, partnership, association or juridical person or a public officer or employee and the dispute is in connection with the performance of his official functions;
Where one of the parties is non-IP/ICC or does not belong to the same IP/IC Community, except when he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders/Leaders;
Where the relief sought for in the complaint or petition seeks to prevent any grave, imminent and irreparable damage or injury that may result if not acted upon immediately; and
Where the Council of Elders/Leaders refuses to issue the necessary certification without justifiable reasons. (Emphasis supplied.)
Thus, it is my position that the NCIP has jurisdiction over the following:
a. claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs arising between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP; and
b. claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs arising between or among ICCs/IPs even if one of the parties does not belong to the same IP/IC Community.
All cases and disputes where both parties are ICCs/IPs fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the NCIP. Consequently, all cases and disputes where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP are covered by the jurisdiction of the regular courts regardless of the subject matter even if it involves ancestral domains or lands of ICCs/IPs. Moreover, the regular courts have jurisdiction over cases and disputes as long as there are parties who are non-ICCs/IPs.
To limit the jurisdiction of the NCIP to claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs arising between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP would be contrary to the purpose for which the NCIP was created. It must be pointed out that the NCIP is an administrative body entrusted with the regulation of activities coming under its special knowledge and training. It is charged with the implementation of the law, considering its competence, expertise, experience and informed judgment. As such, the NCIP is vested with quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative powers. It is the primary government agency "responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies, plans and programs to promote and protect the rights and well-being of the ICCs/IPs and the recognition of their ancestral domains as well as their rights thereto."
[5]
 It is quasi-judicial because it has jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving the rights of the ICCs/IPs.
[6]
 It is quasi-legislative because of its rule-making power.
[7]
 Because of its expertise in the field of ICCs/IPs, it is better equipped than the trial courts in resolving the claims and disputes involving rights where the parties are both ICCs/IPs.
Anent the issue as to what customary laws apply in cases where the parties involved in the claims and disputes do not belong to the same IP/IC Community, the NCIP may apply the customary law common to both ICCs/IPs or that which can be applied by analogy.
Furthermore, it must be pointed out that there is no need to declare the following provisions as null and void:
i. The first and third paragraphs of Rule IX, Section 1 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 8371 which provide:
Section 1. Primacy of Customary Law
. All conflicts related to ancestral domains and lands, involving ICCs/IPs, such as but not limited to conflicting claims and boundary disputes, shall be resolved by the concerned parties through the application of customary laws in the area where the disputed ancestral domain or land is located.
x x x x
All decisions of the NCIP may be brought on Appeal by Petition for Review to the Court of Appeals within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the Order or Decision.
ii. Rule III, Section 5 of the NCIP Rules which provides:
Section. 5. Jurisdiction of the NCIP. The NCIP through its Regional Hearing Offices shall exercise jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs and all cases pertaining to the implementation, enforcement, and interpretation of R.A. 8371, including but not limited to the following:
(1) Original and Exclusive Jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Office (RHO):
 Cases involving disputes and controversies over ancestral lands/domains of ICCs/IPs;
Cases involving violations of the requirement of free and prior and informed consent of ICCs/IPs;
Actions for enforcement of decisions of ICCs/IPs involving violations of customary laws or desecration of ceremonial sites, sacred places, or rituals;
Actions for redemption/reconveyance under Section 8(b) of R.A. 8371; and
Such other cases analogous to the foregoing.
(2) Original Jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Officer:
Cases affecting property rights, claims of ownership, hereditary succession, and settlement of land disputes, between and among ICCs/IPs that have not been settled under customary laws; and
Actions for damages arising out of any violation of Republic Act No. 8371.
(3) Exclusive and Original Jurisdiction of the Commission:
Petition for cancellation of Certificate of Ancestral Domain Titles/Certificate of Ancestral Land Titles (CADTs/CALTs) alleged to have been fraudulently acquired by, and issued to, any person or community as provided for under Section 54 of R.A. 8371. Provided that such action is filed within one (1) year from the date of registration.
[8]
iii. Rule IV, Sections 13 and 14 of the NCIP Rules which provide:
Section 13. Certification to File Action. Upon the request of the proper party, members of the indigenous dispute settlement group or council of elders shall likewise issue a certification to file action before the NCIP. In giving due regard to customary laws, the certification may be in any form so long as it states in substance the failure of settlement notwithstanding the efforts made under customary law or traditional practices.
[9]
Section 14. Exceptions. The certification shall not be required in the following cases:
a. Where one of the parties is a public or private corporation, partnership, association or juridical person or a public officer or employee and the dispute is in connection with the performance of his official functions;
b. Where one of the parties is non-IP/ICC or does not belong to the same IP/IC Community, except when he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders/Leaders;
c. Where the relief sought for in the complaint or petition seeks to prevent any grave, imminent and irreparable damage or injury that may result if not acted upon immediately; and
d. Where the Council of Elders/Leaders refuse to issue the necessary certification without justifiable reasons.
[10]
The abovementioned rules can be interpreted in harmony with the provisions of the IPRA law. Said rules do not expand the jurisdiction of the NCIP but merely enumerate the claims and disputes falling within its jurisdiction. Section 14(b) does not automatically dispense with the certification required by law as the parties may opt to voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders/Leaders. This is akin to a
 barangay
 conciliation proceeding under the Local Government Code wherein the conciliation process is a condition precedent that affects the sufficiency of the cause of action, not the jurisdiction of the court.
[11]
However, the second paragraph of Rule IX, Section 1 of the IRR of R.A. No. 8371 is not anchored on legal mooring. Said paragraph reads:
Section 1. Primacy of Customary Law. 
All conflicts related to the ancestral domains or lands where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP
 or where the dispute could not be resolved through customary law shall be heard and adjudicated in accordance with the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedures Before the NCIP to be adopted hereafter. (Emphasis supplied.)
As earlier discussed, Section 66 of R.A. No. 8371 is explicit that the NCIP's jurisdiction is confined only to claims and disputes where the parties are both ICCs/IPs. Such being the case, the second paragraph of Rule IX, Section 1 of the IRR of R.A. No. 8371 should be declared null and void because it is contrary to the provision of Section 66 of the IPRA. It is well-settled that an administrative rule or regulation must conform, not contradict, the provisions of the enabling law.
[12]
 A rule or regulation cannot modify, expand, or subtract from the law it is intended to implement.
[13]
 Any rule that is not consistent with the statute itself is null and void.
[14]
 Since the rule in question is at war with Section 66 of R.A. No. 8371, then it must be excised.
Anent the resolution of the substantive issue in the case at bar, I agree with the ponencia that the RTC has jurisdiction over the instant dispute.
ACCORDINGLY

DENY

CONCURRING OPINION
PEREZ, 
J.
:
While I agree with the holding in this case that jurisdiction over the original and amended complaint, 
accion reivindicatoria
 and injunction, before the court 
a quo
, correctly lies with the Regional Trial Courts (RTCs): (1) an 
accion reivindicatoria,
 a civil action involving interest in real property with an assessed value of P683,760.00; and (2) an injunction, a civil action incapable of pecuniary estimation, I offer my view on the complex nature of the jurisdiction of the National Commission of Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) conferred in the Indigenous People's Rights Act (IPRA), Republic Act No. 8371.
Even if in this case the complaint was amended from an 
accion reivindicatoria
 to one for injunction, both containing allegations clearly falling within the RTCs jurisdiction, petitioners insist and maintain that as indigenous persons, except for two (2) petitioners, with the subject property claimed as their ancestral land, the NCIP has exclusive and original jurisdiction over the case. For the petitioners, with a submission that the 
ponencia
 already dismissed, the mere fact that this case involves members of Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Persons (ICCs/IPs) and their ancestral land, automatically endows the NCIP, under Section 66 of the IPRA, with jurisdiction over petitioners' complaint. Even the NCIP is of the view of its original and exclusive jurisdiction over both the original and amended complaints. Hence, the two (2) Motions to Refer the Case to the Regional Hearing Office-National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (RHO-NCIP) filed by the NCIP Hearing Officer before the court 
a quo
.
I concur with the 
ponencia 
on the basis of the principle that "jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint, and that the averments in the complaint and the character of the relief sought are the ones to be consulted." As clearly delineated in the 
ponencia,
 upon a careful review of Section 66 and based on the qualifying proviso, the NCIP shall have jurisdiction over claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs only when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP. And, as clearly alleged by the petitioners in their complaint, the defendants they impleaded are not indigenous people.
I submit that the jurisdiction of the NCIP ought to be definitively drawn to settle doubts that still linger due to the implicit affirmation done in 
The City Government of Baguio City, et al. v. Atty. Masweng, et al
.
[1]
 of the NCIP's jurisdiction over cases where one of the parties are not ICCs/IPs.
Jurisdiction is the power and authority, conferred by the Constitution and by statute, to hear and decide a case.
[2]
 The authority to decide a cause at all is what makes up jurisdiction.
The enabling statute, Section 66 of the IPRA, is the measure of quasi-judicial powers the NCIP may exercise:
[3]
Sec. 66. 
Jurisdiction of the NCIP
. - 
The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs
: Provided, however, 
That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws
. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP. (Emphasis supplied).
The conferment of such jurisdiction is consistent with state policy averred in the IPRA which recognizes and promotes all the rights of ICCs/IPs within the framework of the Constitution. Such is likewise reflected in the mandate of the NCIP to protect and promote the interest and well-being of the ICCs/IPs with due regard to their beliefs, customs, traditions and institutions.
[4]
The other provisions point out that the NCIP is the primary government agency responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies, plans and programs to promote and protect the rights and well-being of the ICCs/IPs and the recognition of their ancestral domains as well as their rights thereto.
[5]
 Nonetheless, the creation of such a government agency does not 
per se 
grant it primary and/or exclusive and original jurisdiction, excluding the regular courts from taking cognizance, and exercising jurisdiction over cases which may involve rights of ICCs/IPs.
Significantly, while Section 66 uses the word "all" to qualify the ICCs/IPs "claims and disputes" covered by NCIP jurisdiction, it unmistakably contains the proviso, that restrains or limits the initial generality of the grant of jurisdiction.
As outlined in the
 ponencia,
 the elements of the grant of jurisdiction to the NCIP are: (1) the claim and dispute involves the rights of ICCs/IPs; 
and
 (2) both parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. Both elements must be present prior to the invocation and exercise of the NCIP's jurisdiction.
We cannot, therefore, be confined to the first phrase that the NCIP shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs and therefrom deduce primary sole NCIP jurisdiction over all ICCs/IPs claims and disputes 
to the exclusion of the regular courts
. If it were the legislative intention that: (1) the NCIP exercise primary jurisdiction over, and/or (2) the regular courts be excluded from taking cognizance of, claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs, the legislature could have easily done so as in other instances conferring primary, and original and exclusive jurisdiction to a specific administrative body.
Primary jurisdiction, also known as the doctrine of Prior Resort, is the power and authority vested by the Constitution or by statute upon an administrative body to act upon a matter by virtue of its specific competence.
[6]
 The doctrine of primary jurisdiction prevents the court from arrogating unto itself the authority to resolve a controversy which falls under the jurisdiction of a tribunal possessed with special competence.
[7]
 In one occasion, we have held that regular courts cannot or should not determine a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal before the question is resolved by the administrative tribunal, where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact, and a uniformity of ruling is essential to comply with the purposes of the regulatory statute administered.
[8]
 The objective of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is "to guide a court in determining whether it should refrain from exercising its jurisdiction until after an administrative agency has determined some question arising in the proceeding before the court."
[9]
Additionally, primary jurisdiction does not necessarily denote exclusive jurisdiction.
[10]
 It applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, has been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such case, the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its view.
[11]
 In some instances, the Constitution and statutes grant the administrative body primary jurisdiction, concurrent with either similarly authorized government agencies or the regular courts, such as the distinct kinds of jurisdiction bestowed by the Constitution and statutes on the Ombudsman.
The case of 
Honasan II v. The Panel of Investigating Prosecutors of the Department of Justice
[12]
 delineated primary and concurrent jurisdiction as opposed to original and exclusive jurisdiction vested by both the Constitution and statutes
[13]
 on the Ombudsman concurrent, albeit primary, with the Department of Justice.
Paragraph (1) of Section 13, Article XI of the Constitution, 
viz
:
SEC. 13. 
The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions, and duties
:
1. Investigate on its own, or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public official, employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient.
does not exclude other government agencies tasked by law to investigate and prosecute cases involving public officials. If it were the intention of the framers of the 1987 Constitution, they would have expressly declared the exclusive conferment of the power to the Ombudsman. Instead, paragraph (8) of the same Section 13 of the Constitution provides:
(8) Promulgate its rules of procedure and exercise such other powers or perform such functions or duties as may be provided by law.
Accordingly, Congress enacted R.A. 6770, otherwise known as "The Ombudsman Act of 1989." Section 15 thereof provides:
Sec. 15. Powers, Functions and Duties. - The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions and duties:
(1) Investigate and prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient. 
It has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan and, in the exercise of this primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigatory agency of the government, the investigation of such cases.
Pursuant to the authority given to the Ombudsman by the Constitution and the Ombudsman Act of 1989 to lay down its own rules and procedure, the Office of the Ombudsman promulgated Administrative Order No. 8, dated November 8, 1990, entitled, 
Clarifying and Modifying Certain Rules of Procedure of the Ombudsman
, to wit:
A complaint filed in or taken cognizance of by the Office of the Ombudsman charging any public officer or employee including those in government-owned or controlled corporations, with an act or omission alleged to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient is an Ombudsman case. Such a complaint may be the subject of criminal or administrative proceedings, or both.
For purposes of investigation and prosecution, Ombudsman cases involving criminal offenses may be subdivided into two classes, to wit: (I) those cognizable by the Sandiganbayan, and (2) those falling under the jurisdiction of the regular courts. The difference between the two, aside from the category of the courts wherein they are filed, is on the authority to investigate as distinguished from the authority to prosecute, such cases.
The power to investigate or conduct a preliminary investigation on any Ombudsman case may be exercised by an investigator or prosecutor of the Office of the Ombudsman, or by any Provincial or City Prosecutor or their assistance, either in their regular capacities or as deputized Ombudsman prosecutors.
The prosecution of cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan shall be under the direct exclusive control and supervision of the Office of the Ombudsman. In cases cognizable by the regular Courts, the control and supervision by the Office of the Ombudsman is only in Ombudsman cases in the sense defined above. The law recognizes a concurrence of jurisdiction between the Office of the Ombudsman and other investigative agencies of the government in the prosecution of cases cognizable by regular courts.
It is noteworthy that as early as 1990, the Ombudsman had properly differentiated the authority to investigate cases from the authority to prosecute cases. It is on this note that the Court will first dwell on the nature or extent of the authority of the Ombudsman to investigate cases. Whence, focus is directed to the second sentence of paragraph (1), Section 15 of the Ombudsman Act which specifically provides that the Ombudsman has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan, and, in the exercise of this primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigating agency of the government, the investigation of such cases.
That the power of the Ombudsman to investigate offenses involving public officers or employees is not exclusive but is concurrent with other similarly authorized agencies of the government such as the provincial, city and state prosecutors has long been settled in several decisions of the Court. 
(Emphasis supplied)
In 
Cojuangco, Jr. vs. Presidential Commission on Good Government,
 decided in 1990, the Court expressly declared:
A reading of the foregoing provision of the Constitution does not show that the power of investigation including preliminary investigation vested on the Ombudsman is exclusive.
Interpreting the primary jurisdiction of the Ombudsman under Section 15 (1) of the Ombudsman Act, the Court held in said case:
Under Section 15 (1) of Republic Act No. 6770 aforecited, the Ombudsman has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan so that it may take over at any stage from any investigatory agency of the government, the investigation of such cases.
 The authority of the Ombudsman to investigate offenses involving public officers or employees is not exclusive but is concurrent with other similarly authorized agencies of the government. Such investigatory agencies referred to include the PCGG and the provincial and city prosecutors and their assistants, the state prosecutors and the judges of the municipal trial courts and municipal circuit trial court.
In other words the provision of the law has opened up the authority to conduct preliminary investigation of offenses cognizable by the Sandiganbayan to all investigatory agencies of the government duly authorized to conduct a preliminary investigation under Section 2, Rule 112 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure with the only qualification that the Ombudsman may take over at any stage of such investigation in the exercise of his primary jurisdiction.
A little over a month later, the Court, in 
Deloso vs. Domingo
, pronounced that the Ombudsman, under the authority of Section 13 (1) of the 1987 Constitution, has jurisdiction to investigate any crime committed by a public official, elucidating thus:
As protector of the people, the office of the Ombudsman has the power, function and duty to "act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against public officials" (Sec. 12) and to "investigate x x x any act or omission of any public official x x x when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient." (Sec. 13.) The Ombudsman is also empowered to "direct the officer concerned," in this case the Special Prosecutor, "to take appropriate action against a public official xxx and to recommend his prosecution" (Sec. 13).
The clause "any [illegal] act or omission of any public official" is broad enough to embrace any crime committed by a public official. The law does not qualify the nature of the illegal act or omission of the public official or employee that the Ombudsman may investigate. It does not require that the act or omission be related to or be connected with or arise from, the performance of official duty. Since the law does not distinguish, neither should we.
The reason for the creation of the Ombudsman in the 1987 Constitution and for the grant to it of broad investigative authority, is to insulate said office from the long tentacles of officialdom that are able to penetrate judges' and fiscals' offices, and others involved in the prosecution of erring public officials, and through the exertion of official pressure and influence, quash, delay, or dismiss investigations into malfeasances and misfeasances committed by public officers. It was deemed necessary, therefore, to create a special office to investigate 
all
 criminal complaints against public officers regardless of whether or not the acts or omissions complained of are related to or arise from the performance of the duties of their office. The Ombudsman Act makes perfectly clear that the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman encompasses "
all kinds of malfeasance, misfeasance, and non-feasance
 that have been committed by any officer or employee as mentioned in Section 13 hereof, during his tenure of office" (Sec. 16, R.A. 6770).
Indeed, the labors of the constitutional commission that created the Ombudsman as a special body to investigate erring public officials would be wasted if its jurisdiction were confined to the investigation of minor and less grave offenses arising from, or related to, the duties of public office, but would exclude those grave and terrible crimes that spring from abuses of official powers and prerogatives, for it is the investigation of the latter where the need for an independent, fearless, and honest investigative body, like the Ombudsman, is greatest.
At first blush, there appears to be conflicting views in the rulings of the Court in the
 Cojuangco, Jr. 
case and the 
Deloso
 case. However, the contrariety is more apparent than real. In subsequent cases, the Court elucidated on the nature of the powers of the Ombudsman to investigate.
In 1993, the Court held in 
Sanchez vs. Demetriou,
 that while it may be true that the Ombudsman has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute any illegal act or omission of any public official, the authority of the Ombudsman to investigate is merely a primary and not an exclusive authority, thus:
The Ombudsman is indeed empowered under Section 15, paragraph (1) of RA 6770 to investigate and prosecute any illegal act or omission of any public official. However as we held only two years ago in the case of 
Aguinaldo vs. Domagas
, this authority "is not an exclusive authority but rather a shared or concurrent authority in respect of the offense charged."
Petitioners finally assert that the information and amended information filed in this case needed the approval of the Ombudsman. It is not disputed that the information and amended information here did not have the approval of the Ombudsman. However, we do not believe that such approval was necessary at all. In 
Deloso v. Domingo
, 191 SCRA 545 (1990), the Court held that the Ombudsman has authority to investigate charges of illegal acts or omissions on the part of any public official, i.e., any crime imputed to a public official. 
It must, however, be pointed out that the authority of the Ombudsman to investigate "any [illegal] act or omission of any public official" (191 SCRA 550) is not an exclusive authority but rather a shared or concurrent authority in respect of the offense charged
, i.e., the crime of sedition. Thus, the non-involvement of the office of the Ombudsman in the present case does not have any adverse legal consequence upon the authority of the panel of prosecutors to file and prosecute the information or amended information.
In fact, other investigatory agencies of the government such as the Department of Justice in connection with the charge of sedition, and the Presidential Commission on Good Government, in ill gotten wealth cases, may conduct the investigation.
In 
Natividad vs. Felix
, a 1994 case, where the petitioner municipal mayor contended that it is the Ombudsman and not the provincial fiscal who has the authority to conduct a preliminary investigation over his case for alleged Murder, the Court held:
The 
Deloso
 case has already been re-examined in two cases, namely 
Aguinaldo vs. Domagas
 and 
Sanchez vs. Demetriou
. However, by way of amplification, we feel the need for tracing the history of the legislation relative to the jurisdiction of Sandiganbayan since the Ombudsman's primary jurisdiction is dependent on the cases cognizable by the former.
In the process, we shall observe how the policy of the law, with reference to the subject matter, has been in a state of flux.
These laws, in chronological order, are the following: (a) Pres. Decree No. 1486, â the first law on the Sandiganbayan; (b) Pres. Decree No. 1606 which expressly repealed Pres. Decree No. 1486; (c) Section 20 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129; (d) Pres. Decree No. 1860; and (e) Pres. Decree No. 1861.
The latest law on the Sandiganbayan, Sec. 1 of Pres. Decree No. 1861 reads as follows:
"SECTION 1. Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1606 is hereby amended to read as follows:
'SEC. 4. 
Jurisdiction
. - The Sandiganbayan shall exercise: 
'(a) Exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases involving:
(2) Other offenses or felonies committed by public officers and employees 
in relation to their office
, including those employed in government-owned or controlled corporation, whether simple or complexed with other crimes, where the penalty prescribed by law is higher that prision correccional or imprisonment for six (6) years, or a fme of P6,000: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that offenses or felonies mentioned in this paragraph where the penalty prescribed by law does not exceed prision correccional or imprisonment for six (6) years or a fme of P6,000 shall be tried by the proper Regional Trial Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court and Municipal Circuit Trial Court."
A perusal of the aforecited law shows that two requirements must concur under Sec. 4 (a) (2) for an offense to fall under the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction, namely: the offense committed by the public officer must be in relation to his office and the penalty prescribed be higher then 
prision correccional
 or imprisonment for six (6) years, or a fine of P6,000.00.
Applying the law to the case at bench, we find that although the second requirement has been met, the first requirement is wanting. A review of these Presidential Decrees, except Batas Pambansa Big. 129, would reveal that the crime committed by public officers or employees must be "in relation to their office" if it is to fall within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. This phrase which is traceable to Pres. Decree No. 1468, has been retained by Pres. Decree No. 1861 as a requirement before the Ombudsman can acquire primary jurisdiction on its power to investigate.
It cannot be denied that Pres. Decree No. 1861 is in pan materia to Article XI, Sections 12 and 13 of the 1987 Constitution and the Ombudsman Act of 1989 because, as earlier mentioned, the Ombudsman's power to investigate is dependent on the cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan. Statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same person or thing or to the same class of persons or things, or object, or cover the same specific or particular subject matter.
It is axiomatic in statutory construction that a statute must be interpreted, not only to be consistent with itself, but also to harmonize with other laws on the same subject matter, as to form a complete, coherent and intelligible system. The rule is expressed in the maxim, "interpretare et concordare legibus est optimus interpretandi, " or every statute must be so construed and harmonized with other statutes as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence. Thus, in the application and interpretation of Article XI, Sections 12 and 13 of the 1987 Constitution and the Ombudsman Act of 1989, Pres. Decree No. 1861 must be taken into consideration. It must be assumed that when the 1987 Constitution was written, its framers had in mind previous statutes relating to the same subject matter. In the absence of any express repeal or amendment, the 1987 Constitution and the Ombudsman Act of 1989 are deemed in accord with existing statute, specifically, Pres. Decree No. 1861.
R.A. No. 8249 which amended Section 4, paragraph (b) of the Sandiganbayan Law (P.D. 1861) likewise provides that for other offenses, aside from those enumerated under paragraphs (a) and (c), to fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, they must have been committed by public officers or employees in relation to their office.
In summation, the Constitution, Section 15 of the Ombudsman Act of 1989 and Section 4 of the Sandiganbayan Law, as amended, do not give to the Ombudsman exclusive jurisdiction to investigate offenses committed by public officers or employees. The authority of the Ombudsman to investigate offenses involving public officers or employees is concurrent with other government investigating agencies such as provincial, city and state prosecutors. However, the Ombudsman, in the exercise of its primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan, may take over, at any stage, from any investigating agency of the government, the investigation of such cases.
In other words, respondent DOJ Panel is not precluded from conducting any investigation of cases against public officers involving violations of penal laws but if the cases fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, then respondent Ombudsman may, in the exercise of its primary jurisdiction take over at any stage
. (Emphasis supplied)
xxx          xxx
To reiterate for emphasis, the power to investigate or conduct preliminary investigation on charges against any public officers or employees may be exercised by an investigator or by any provincial or city prosecutor or their assistants, either in their regular capacities or as deputized Ombudsman prosecutors. The fact that all prosecutors are in effect deputized Ombudsman prosecutors under the OMB-DOJ Circular is a mere superfluity. The DOJ Panel need not be authorized nor deputized by the Ombudsman to conduct the preliminary investigation for complaints filed with it because the DOJ's authority to act as the principal law agency of the government and investigate the commission of crimes under the Revised Penal Code is derived from the Revised Administrative Code which had been held in the 
Natividad 
case as not being contrary to the Constitution. Thus, there is not even a need to delegate the conduct of the preliminary investigation to an agency which has the jurisdiction to do so in the first place. However, the Ombudsman may assert its primary jurisdiction at any stage of the investigation.
 (Emphasis supplied)
I referred to
 Honasan II 
to emphasize the point that the NCIP cannot be said to have primary jurisdiction over all the ICC/IP cases comparable to what the Ombudsman has in cases falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. We do not find such specificity in the grant of jurisdiction to the NCIP in Section 66 of the IPRA.
Neither does the IPRA confer 
original and exclusive jurisdiction
 to the NCIP over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs.
Here, I revert to the point on the investiture of primary and/or original and exclusive jurisdiction to an administrative body which in all instances of such grant was explicitly provided in the Constitution and/or the enabling statute, to wit:
1. Commission on Elections' exclusive original jurisdiction over all elections contests;
[14]
2. Securities and Exchange Commission's original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases enumerated under Section 5 of Presidential Decree No. 902-A
[15]
 prior to its transfer to courts of general jurisdiction or the appropriate Regional Trial Court by virtue of Section 4 of the Securities Regulation Code;
3. Energy Regulatory Commission's original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases contesting rates, fees, fines and penalties imposed by it in the exercise of its powers, functions and responsibilities;
[16]
4. Department of Agrarian Reform's
[17]
 primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and its exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources;
[18]
5. Construction' Industry Arbitration Commission's original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes involving contracts of construction, whether government or private, as long as the parties agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration;
[19]
6. Voluntary arbitrator or panel of voluntary arbitrators' original and exclusive jurisdiction over all unresolved grievances arising from the interpretation or implementation of the collective bargaining agreement and those arising from the interpretation or enforcement of company personnel policies;
[20]
7. The National Labor Relations Commission's original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases listed in Article 217 of the Labor Code involving all workers, whether agricultural or non-agricultural; and
8. Board of Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration's primary and exclusive jurisdiction over all deportation cases.
[21]
That the proviso found in Section 66 of the IPRA is exclusionary, specifically excluding disputes involving rights of IPs/ICCs where the opposing party is non-ICC/IP, is reflected in the IPRA's emphasis of customs and customary law to govern in the lives of the ICCs/IPs.
Indeed, non-ICCs/IPs cannot be subjected to the special and limited jurisdiction of the NCIP even if the dispute involves rights of ICCs/IPs since the NCIP has no power and authority to decide on a controversy 
involving as well rights of non-ICCs/IPs which may be brought before a court of general jurisdiction within the legal bounds of rights and remedies
. Even as a practical concern, non-IPs and non-members of ICCs ought to be excepted from the NCIP's competence since it cannot determine the right-duty correlative, and breach thereof, between opposing parties who are ICCs/IPs and non-ICCs/IPs, the controversy necessarily contemplating application of other laws, not only customs and customary law of the ICCs/IPs. In short, the NCIP is only vested with jurisdiction to determine the rights of ICCs/IPs based on customs and customary law in a given controversy against another ICC/IP, but not the applicable law for each and every kind of ICC/IP controversy even against an opposing non-ICC/IP.
In 
San Miguel Corporation v. NLRC
,
[22]
 the Court delineated the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, specifically paragraph 3 thereof, as all money claims of workers, limited to "cases arising from employer-employee relations." The same clause was not expressly carried over, in printer's ink, in Article 217 as it exists today, but the Court ruled that such was a limitation on the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, thus:
The jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the National Labor Relations Commission is outlined in Article 217 of the Labor Code xxx:
"ART. 217. Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the Commission. â (a) The Labor Arbiters shall have the original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide within thirty (30) working days after submission of the case by the parties for decision, the following cases involving all workers, whether agricultural or non-agricultural:
1. Unfair labor practice cases;
2. Those that workers may file involving wages, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment;
3. All money claims of workers, including those based on non-payment or underpayment of-wages, overtime compensation, separation pay and other benefits provided by law or appropriate agreement, except claims for employees' compensation, social security, medicare and maternity benefits;
4. Cases involving household services; and
5. Cases arising from any violation of Article 265 of this Code, including questions involving the legality of strikes and lockouts.
(b) The Commission shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by Labor Arbiters."
While paragraph 3 above refers to "all money claims of workers," 
it is not necessary to suppose that the entire universe of money claims that might be asserted by workers against their employers has been absorbed into the original and exclusive jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters
. In the first place, paragraph 3 should be read not in isolation from but rather within the context formed by paragraph 1 (relating to unfair labor practices), paragraph 2 (relating to claims concerning terms and conditions of employment), paragraph 4 (claims relating to household services, a particular species of employer-employee relations), and paragraph 5 (relating to certain activities prohibited to employees or to employers). It is evident that there is a unifying element which runs through paragraphs 1 to 5 and that is, that they all refer to cases or disputes arising out of or in connection with an employer-employee relationship. This is, in other words, a situation where the rule of noscitur a sociis may be usefully invoked in clarifying the scope of paragraph 3, and any other paragraph of Article 217 of the Labor Code, as amended. We reach the above conclusion from an examination of the terms themselves of Article 217, as last amended by BP Blg. 227, and even though earlier versions of Article 217 of the Labor Code expressly brought within the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiters and the NLRC "cases arising from employer-employee relations,'" which clause was not expressly carried over, in printer's ink, in Article 217 as it exists today. For it cannot be presumed that money claims of workers which do not arise out of or in connection with their employer-employee relationship, and which would therefore fall within the general jurisdiction of the regular courts of justice, were intended by the legislative authority to be taken away from the jurisdiction of the courts and lodged with Labor Arbiters on an exclusive basis. The Court, therefore, believes and so holds that the "money claims of workers" referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 217 embraces money claims which arise out of or in connection the employer-employee relationship, or some aspect or incident of such relationship. Put a little differently, that money claims of workers which now fall within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters are those money claims which have some reasonable causal connection with the employer-employee relationship. (Emphasis supplied)
Clearly, the phraseology of "
all
 claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs" does not necessarily grant the NCIP all-encompassing jurisdiction whenever the case involves rights of ICCs/IPs without regard to the status of the parties, i.e. whether the opposing parties are both ICCs/IPs.
In all, for the reason that under the provisions of the IPRA, specifically Section 66 thereof, the jurisdiction of the NCIP is special and limited, confined only to cases involving rights of IPs/ICCs, where both such parties belong to the same ICC/IP, the original and amended complaint herein properly fall within the jurisdiction of the regular courts, specifically the RTC. Thus, I concur in the denial of the petition.

CONCURRING OPINION 
LEONEN,
 J
..:
I concur with the ponencia in holding that respondents' action, alleged to be involving a claim over the ancestral domain of an indigenous cultural community/indigenous people (ICC/IP), does not fall within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP).
A careful reading of Section 66
[1]
 of Republic Act No. 8371, otherwise known as the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997, with particular emphasis on its proviso will reveal that the jurisdiction of the NCIP is limited to disputes where both parties are members of ICC/IPs and come from the same ethnolinguistic group. 
Thus, the assailed Decision dated August 17, 2006 and Resolution dated July 4, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 00204-MIN must be affirmed.
The present Petition for Review on Certiorari
[2]
 is an offshoot of a Petition for 
Accion Reivindicatoria
 with prayer for issuance of a temporary restraining order or preliminary prohibitory injunction with damages
[3]
 (Original Complaint) filed by respondents against petitioners before the Regional Trial Court of Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon on March 3, 2004, docketed as Civil Case No. 04-03-01. This Petition for 
Accion Reivindicatoria
 was subsequently amended by respondents into a Complaint for injunction, damages, and other relief
[4]
 (Amended Complaint).
On March 20, 2004, petitioners Brazil and Macapayag filed their Answer to the original Complaint, asserting that respondents had no cause of action against them.
[5]
On March 23, 2004, the other petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss. They argued that the Regional Trial Court had no jurisdiction over the case. They asserted that they were members of the Miarayon, Lapok, Lirongan Talaandig Tribal Association or the Talaandig Tribe, and claimed residence in Barangay Miarayon, Talakag, Bukidnon. They noted that on July 25, 2003, Certificate of Ancestral Domain Claim No. R-10-TAL-0703-0010 was issued in favor of the Talaandig Tribe through NCIP En Bane Resolution No. 08-2003. On October 30, 2003, this Certificate of Ancestral Domain Claim was formally awarded to the Talaandig Tribe by former President Gloria-Macapagal Arroyo. The Certificate covered a total area of 11,105.5657 hectares in Barangay Miarayon, Talakag, Bukidnon.
[6]
 Petitioners argued that as the case filed by respondents entailed a dispute over the ancestral land of an ICC/IP, it fell within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the NCIP.
[7]
On July 1, 2004, the NCIP filed a Motion to Refer the Case to the Regional Hearing Office - National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (Motion to Refer). As with petitioners who filed the Motion to Dismiss, the NCIP insisted that the Regional Trial Court did not have jurisdiction over the case.
[8]
On July 5, 2004, respondents filed a Motion to Amend and Supplement the original Complaint into one for injunction, damages, and other relief. Attached to this Motion was the amended Complaint.
[9]
On July 30, 3004, petitioners filed their Opposition to the Admission of the amended Complaint. On August 1, 2004, they also filed a Motion to Dismiss the amended Complaint, insisting on the Regional Trial Court's lack of jurisdiction.
[10]
On August 10, 2004, the Regional Trial Court issued the Order granting the Motion to Amend and Supplement. The same Order declared the NCIP's Motion to Refer and petitioners' Motions to Dismiss moot and academic.
[11]
On August 25, 2004, petitioners filed another Motion to Refer and another Motion to Dismiss.
[12]
On September 14, 2004, respondents filed their Opposition and a Motion for Judgment by Default.
[13]
On February 14, 2005, the Regional Trial Court issued the Order denying the Motion to Refer, declaring petitioners (except Macapayag and Brazil, who had earlier filed an Answer) in default, and calling the case for pre-trial (against Macapayag and Brazil) and for ex-parte presentation of evidence (against the other petitioners). The court also issued a Writ of Preliminary Injunction subject to respondents' posting of a P100,000.00 bond.
[14]
Aggrieved, petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure before the Court of Appeals.
In the Decision
[15]
 dated August 17, 2006, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification (i.e., lifted the order of default) the Regional Trial Court's February 14, 2005 Order. In the Resolution dated July 4, 2007, the Court of Appeals denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration.
Hence, this Petition was filed.
Petitioners pray that the Court of Appeals' August 17, 2006 Decision and July 4, 2007 Resolution be reversed and set aside and that a decision be rendered declaring that the Regional Trial Court has no jurisdiction, enjoining the Regional Trial Court from proceeding, ordering that the case be referred to the NCIP, and declaring void the Writ of Preliminary Injunction issued by the Regional Trial Court.
Petitioners insist that the NCIP has exclusive and original jurisdiction over the case as it involves the ancestral domain of an ICC/IP. They also assail the amendment of the Complaint from 
accion reivindicatoria
 to one for injunction, saying that the amendment was made merely to clothe the Regional Trial Court with jurisdiction and to downplay how the case is ultimately concerned with an ICC/IP's rights over its ancestral domain. Likewise, they claim that the NCIP should not be deprived of jurisdiction merely on account of the Complaints' failure to allege that parties to the case belong to ICCs/IPs.
This case concerns the issue of which, between the Regional Trial Court and the NCIP, has jurisdiction over the case.
The case filed by respondents does not fall within the scope of the NCIP's jurisdiction as laid out in Section 66
[16]
 of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act.
"Jurisdiction is the power and authority of [a] tribunal to hear, try and decide a case."
[17]
 Moreover, "[jurisdiction over a subject matter is conferred by law."
[18]
 It could not be conferred by any other source, such as the parties' action or conduct and "any judgment, order or resolution issued without it is void."
[19]
I
The NCIP does not have jurisdiction over cases where one of the parties does not belong to an indigenous cultural community.
Section 38 of the Act created the NCIP to carry out the policies set forth in the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act. Per Section 38, the NCIP "shall be the primary government agency responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies, plans and programs to promote and protect the rights and well-being of the ICCs/IPs and the recognition of their ancestral domains as well as their rights thereto." Section 39 provides for the NCIP's mandate to "protect and promote the interest and well-being of the ICCs/IPs with due regard to their beliefs, customs, traditions and institutions."
Chapter IX of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act pertains to the quasi-judicial powers of the NCIP. Thus, Section 69
[20]
 expressly enables the NCIP to exercise powers that are necessary incidents of this quasi-judicial power: the promulgation of rules and regulations; the administration of oaths; the power to summon parties, issue subpoenas, and contempt power; and the power to issue writs of injunction. Section 68
[21]
 enables the NCIP to issue writs of execution. Section 67
[22]
 provides for the mode of appeal from decisions of the NCIP. Section 70
[23]
 bars inferior courts from restraining proceedings in the NCIP. Section 65
[24]
 establishes a framework for resolving disputes by recognizing the primacy of customary laws and practices.
Section 66 specifically provides for the jurisdiction of the NCIP:
SEC. 66. Jurisdiction of the NCIP. The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs: Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP.
Section 66's grant of jurisdiction is 
ostensibly 
cast in absolute terms: "over 
all
 claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs."
However, further into Section 66 are two clauses that qualify the NCIP's jurisdiction. First is the proviso that "
no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. " Second is that "a certification . . . issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved . . . shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP. "
A cursory reading of these clauses shows that they state a procedural requirement (i.e., exhaustion of remedies under customary law) and a formal requirement (i.e., certification issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders) that must first be complied with before the NCIP may take cognizance of a case. However, these procedural and formal requirements are not all there is to the qualifying clauses of Section 66.
II
Attention must be drawn to the proviso's choice of words. To reiterate, the proviso reads: "Provided, however, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless 
the parties
 have exhausted all remedies provided under 
their
 customary laws."
The proviso uses the plural term "the parties." It also uses the plural "their," which is a possessive pronoun substituting for the noun phrase "the parties."
The use of the 
plural 
"the parties" necessarily means that the requirement of exhaustion of remedies provided under customary laws is a requirement that is
 not exclusive 
to a singular party.
The basic framework of adversarial litigation, as is the case in our a jurisdiction, is one that entails two (2) parties: first, the one initiating or bringing the action (i.e., the plaintiff/complainant/ claimant/petitioner); and the one against whom an action is initiated or brought (i.e., the defendant/respondent).
Thus, for Section 66 to say that "the parties" must exhaust all remedies is to say that 
both
 plaintiff/complainant/claimant/petitioner, on one hand, and defendant/respondent, on the other, must comply. In a case brought by A against B, both A and B must comply with the requirement.
Had Section 66 intended that compliance with the requirement by only one party shall suffice, it should have used the singular "
a party
," similar language like "
either party
" or permissive language like "
a/the party/ies
? Had Section 66 intended that the requirement must be complied with by a specific party, it should have used specific language like "
the petitioner
."
One may point out that the plural "the parties" can be taken to mean two or more of several petitioners, or two or more of several respondents where there are multiple petitioners and/or respondents. This interpretation is untenable. Precisely, it would find application 
only
 in situations where there are multiple petitioners and/or respondents. To adopt this interpretation would, therefore, be to unduly restrict and to render inutile under general circumstances the requirement of exhaustion of remedies.
III
The phrase "their customary laws" is significant in two respects. First, "their" is a plural possessive pronoun substituting for the noun phrase "the parties." Second, "their" is a possessive determiner indicating possession (or otherwise a sense of belonging) of the words that follow it.
Section 66's use of the phrase "their customary laws" is, therefore, to say that "the parties" have customary laws. Considering what the phrase "the parties" refers to (as explained previously), it follows that both the petitioner(s) and the respondent(s) must have or adhere to customary laws in order that a case between them may fall under the jurisdiction of the NCIP.
Section 3(f) of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act defines "customary laws" as follows:
Section 3. Definition of Terms. â For purposes of this Act, the following terms shall mean:
. . . .
f) Customary Laws â refer to a body of written and/or unwritten rules, usages, customs and practices 
traditionally and continually recognized, accepted and observed by respective ICCs/IPs
[.] (Emphasis supplied)
It is evident that only those belonging to ICCs/IPs have or adhere to customary laws. Since Section 66 refers to parties having customary laws, it follows that the NCIP's jurisdiction, as defined in Section 66 of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act, is limited to parties who belong to ICCs/IPs. It excludes those who do not.
To hold otherwise is to summarily compel those who do not belong to ICCs/IPs to adhere and subject themselves to customary laws despite their not having "traditionally and continually recognized, accepted[,] and observed"
[25]
 these laws. This runs afoul of fair play and violates their right to due process.
Thus, Section 66's qualifiersâas specifically wordedâindicate that cases that fall under the jurisdiction of the NCIP must be limited to those where both parties belong to ICCs/IPs.
IV
The requirement that both parties must exhaust all remedies provided under their customary laws necessarily means that both parties must belong to the same ICC/IP.
The word "respective" denotes "belonging or relating to each one of the people or things that have been mentioned."
[26]
Section 3(f) of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act conceives of "customary laws" as "refer[ring] to a body of ... rules, usages, customs[,] and practices traditionally and continually recognized, accepted[,] and observed by 
respective
 ICCs/IPs." Thus, inherent in the Act's conception of "customary laws" is a recognition that each ICC/IP has a set of continually recognized, accepted, and observed rules, usages, customs, and practices that is 
distinct and separate
 from those of other ICCs/IPs.
The recognition that ICCs/IPs have distinct customary laws is similarly a recognition that each ICC/IP has a distinct dispute settlement mechanism pursuant to their respective customary laws. To belong to a specific ICC/IP is, therefore, to say that one adheres not only to a specific set of customary laws but also to a specific dispute settlement mechanism applicable to that ICC/IP.
Thus, much as interpreting Section 66 as encompassing disputes where a party does not belong to an ICC/IP runs afoul of fair play and violates the (non-ICC/IP member's) right to due process, so does interpreting Section 66 as encompassing disputes where the parties belong to different ICCs/IPs. As with the former, to make such a conclusion is to summarily compel a party who adheres to a specific set of customary laws and dispute settlement mechanisms to adhere and be subjected to another set of customary laws.
Rule IV, Section 14 of NCIP Administrative Circular No. 1-03, the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedure Before the NCIP (NCIP Rules) provides for situations "[w]here one of the parties . . . does not belong to the same IP/IC Community" as an exception to the requirement of a certification issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute. This is a recognition that the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act does not provide a dispute settlement mechanism where the parties belong to different ICCs/IPs. However, even as Rule IV, Section 14 of the NCIP Rules does away with the certification requirement, it cannot serve to extend the NCIP's jurisdiction to disputes involving parties from different ICCs/IPs.
V
Extending the NCIP's jurisdiction to those who do not belong to an indigenous cultural community or are not indigenous peoples finds no support elsewhere in the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act.
Section 66 is the sole provision of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act that spells out the NCIP's jurisdiction in respect of the 
exercise of its quasi-judicial power
.
This court has defined quasi-judicial power as follows:
Quasi-judicial or administrative adjudicatory power on the other hand
 is the power of the administrative agency to adjudicate the rights of persons before it.
 It is the power to hear and determine questions of fact to which the legislative policy is to apply and to decide in accordance with the standards laid down by the law itself in enforcing and administering the same law. The administrative body exercises its quasi-judicial power when it performs in a judicial manner an act which is essentially of an executive or administrative nature, where the power to act in such manner is incidental to or reasonably necessary for the performance of the executive or administrative duty entrusted to it. In carrying out their quasi-judicial functions the administrative officers or bodies are 
required to investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, weigh evidence, and draw conclusions from them as basis for their official action and exercise of discretion in a judicial nature.
 Since rights of specific persons are affected it is elementary that in the proper exercise of quasi-judicial power due process must be observed in the conduct of the proceedings.
[27]
 (Emphasis supplied)
Judicial power, in turn, has been defined in 
Macasiano v. National Housing Authority
,
[28]
 as the "right to determine actual controversies arising between adverse litigants."
[29]
 In 
Lopez v. Roxas
:
[30]
Judicial power is the authority to settle justiciable controversies or disputes involving rights that are enforceable and demandable before the courts of justice or the redress of wrongs for violations of such rights.
[31]
It is true that the other provisions of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act pertain to the competencies of the NCIP. However, a reading of these provisions will show that they do not extend the NCIP's jurisdiction, 
in the exercise of its quasi-judicial power
, to those who do not belong to ICCs/IPs.
Section 38
[32]
 creates the NCIP and states its purpose as "the primary government agency responsible for the 
formulation and implementation of policies, plans and programs
 to promote and protect the rights and well-being of the ICCs/IPs and the recognition of their ancestral domains as well as the rights thereto."
Section 39
[33]
 articulates in broad language the mandate of the NCIP to "protect and promote the interest and well-being of the ICCs/IPs with due regard to their beliefs, customs, traditions and institutions."
Section 44
[34]
 provides that the NCIP shall have the "powers, jurisdiction and function" provided therein in order that it may "accomplish its mandate." Section 44 lists 17 of such "powers, 
jurisdiction
 and function":
 
 
(1)
 
 
Item (a) identifies the NCIP "as the 
primary government agency through which ICCs/IPs can seek government assistance and as the medium, through which such assistance
 may be extended."
 
 
 
(2) 
 
Item (b) authorizes the NCIP "[t]o 
review and assess the conditions
 of ICCs/IPs ... to 
propose relevant laws and policies
[,]" a function which is evidently not (quasi-)judicial in nature.
 
 
 
(3)
 
 
Item (c) refers to the "
formulat[ion] and implementation]
 [of] policies, plans, programs and projects[.]"
 
 
 
(4) 
 
Item (d) permits the NCIP to avail itself of "the services and support" of 
experts and consultants
, whether from government or the private sector.
 
 
 
(5)
 
 
Item (e) places in the NCIP the authority "[t]o issue 
certificate[s] of ancestral land/domain title."
 
 
 
(6) 
 
Item (f) enables the NCIP "to enter into 
contracts, agreements, or arrangement[s].
 . . and ... to obtain
 loans
."
 
 
 
(7) 
 
Item (g) enables the NCIP "[t]o negotiate for
 funds
 and to accept grants, donations, gifts[,] and/or
 properties
 . . . and administer the same."
 
 
 
(8) 
 
Item (h) makes the NCIP the "coordinator] [of] development
 programs and projects
."
 
 
 
(9)
 
 
Item (i) enables the NCIP "[t]o convene periodic 
conventions or assemblies
 of IPs to review, assess as well as propose policies or plans."
 
 
 
(10)
 
 
Item (j) spells out the NCIP's advisory and reportorial duties vis-a-vis the President of the Philippines, i.e., "[t]o
 advise the President 
of the Philippines on all matters relating to the ICCs/IPs and to submit within sixty (60) days after the close of each calendar year, a 
report of its operations and achievements
."
 
 
 
(11) 
 
Item (k) allows the NCIP "[t]o submit to Congress appropriate
 legislative proposals
."
 
 
 
(12)
 
 
Item (1) spells out the budgetary duty of the NCIP, ie., "[t]o prepare and submit the appropriate
 budget 
to the Office of the President."
 
 
 
(13) 
 
Item (m) relates to the "
issu[ance] [of] . . . certification[s]
 as a pre-condition to the grant of... authority for the disposition, utilization, management[s] and appropriation by 
any private individual, corporate entity or any government agency, corporation or subdivision thereof 
on any part or portion of the ancestral domain[.]"
 
 
 
(14)
 
 
Item (n) provides for the NCIP's appellate power, i.e., "[t]o 
decide all appeals
 from the decisions and acts of all the various offices within the Commission."
 
 
 
(15) 
 
Item (o) provides for the NCIP's rule-making power, i.e., "[t]o promulgate the necessary
 rules and regulations
 for the implementation of this Act.
 "
 
 
 
(16) 
 
Item (p) is a catch-all provision enabling the NCIP "[t]o exercise such other
 powers and functions as may be directed by the President 
of the Republic of the Philippines."
 
 
 
(17)
 
 
Item (q) allows the NCIP "[t]o represent the Philippine ICCs/IPs in all 
international conferences and conventions 
dealing with indigenous peoples and other related concerns."
 
 
None but two (2) of these 17 "powers, jurisdiction and function[s]" are directly related to the NCIP's exercise of its quasi-judicial power. These two (2) items are item (n)âon the NCIP's appellate powerâand Item (o)â on the NCIP's rule-making powerâ which may be read vis-a-vis Section 69's investiture upon the NCIP of the power "[t]o promulgate rules and regulations governing the hearing and disposition of cases filed before it as well as those pertaining to its internal functions and such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act." Neither of these two states that the NCIP's jurisdiction extends to disputes where a party does not belong to an ICC/IP or to those where the parties belong to different ICCs/IPs.
Item (m) enables the NCIP to exercise authority over those who not belong to ICCs/IPs, i.e., "any private individual, corporate entity or any government agency, corporation or subdivision thereof." However, item (m) refers specifically to the "issuance of certification[s] as a pre-condition to the grant of ... authority for the disposition, utilization, management[s] and appropriation ... on any part or portion of the ancestral domain[.]" It does not refer to the "exercise of discretion in a judicial nature"
[35]
 and the "determin[ation] [of] actual controversies arising between adverse litigants."
[36]
VI
Reliance on the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act's Implementing Rules and Regulations and the NCIP's rules in support of the assertion that the NCIP has jurisdiction is misplaced. In extending the NCIP's jurisdiction, these rules contradict statutory provisions.
Rule IX, Section 1 of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act's Implementing Rules and Regulations reads:
RULE IX. JURISDICTION AND PROCEDURES FOR 
ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHTS
Section 1. Primacy of Customary Law. All conflicts related to ancestral domains and lands, involving ICCs/IPs, such as but not limited to conflicting claims and boundary disputes, shall be resolved by the concerned parties through the application of customary laws in the area where the disputed ancestral domain or land is located.
All conflicts related to the ancestral domains or lands where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP 
or where the dispute could not be resolved through customary law shall be heard and adjudicated in accordance with the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedures Before the NCIP to be adopted hereafter.
All decisions of the NCIP may be brought on Appeal by Petition for Review to the Court of Appeals within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the Order or Decision. (Emphasis supplied)
Rule III, Section 5 of the NCIP Rules, NCIP Administrative Circular No. 1-03 reads:
Sec. 5. Jurisdiction of the NCIP.â
The NCIP through its Regional Hearing Offices shall exercise jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs
 and all cases pertaining to the implementation, enforcement, and interpretation of R.A. 8371, including but not limited to the following:
 
 
(1) 
 
Original and Exclusive Jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Office (RHO):
 
 
 
a.
 
 
Cases involving disputes and controversies over ancestral lands/domains of ICCs/IPs;
 
 
 
b.
 
 
Cases involving violations of the requirement of free and prior and informed consent of ICCs/IPs;
 
 
 
c. 
 
Actions for enforcement of decisions of ICCs/IPs involving violations of customary laws or desecration of ceremonial sites, sacred places, or rituals;
 
 
 
d. 
 
Actions for redemption/reconveyance under Section 8(b) of R.A. 8371; and
 
 
 
e.
 
 
Such other cases analogous to the foregoing.
 
 
 
(2)
 
 
Original Jurisdiction of the Regional Hearing Officer:
 
 
 
a. 
 
Cases affecting property rights, claims of ownership, hereditary succession, and settlement of land disputes, between and among ICCs/IPs that have not been settled under customary laws; and
 
 
 
b. 
 
Actions for damages arising out of any violation of Republic Act No. 8371.
 
 
 
(3) 
 
Exclusive and Original Jurisdiction of the Commission:
 
 
 
a.
 
 
Petition for cancellation of Certificate of Ancestral Domain Titles/Certificate of Ancestral Land Titles (CADTs/CALTs) alleged to have been fraudulently acquired by, and issued to, any person or community as provided for under Section 54 of R.A. 8371. Provided that such action is filed within one (1) year from the date of registration. (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
Apart from these, Rule IV, Sections 13 and 14 of the NCIP Rules provide:
Section 13. Certification to File Action. Upon the request of the proper party, members of the indigenous dispute settlement group or council of elders shall likewise issue a certification to file action before the NCIP. In giving due regard to customary laws, the certification may be in any form so long as it states in substance the failure of settlement notwithstanding the efforts made under customary law or traditional practices.
Section 14. Exceptions. The certification shall not be required in the following cases:
Where one of the parties is a public or private corporation, partnership, association or juridical person or a public officer or employee
 and the dispute is in connection with the performance of his official functions;
Where one of the parties is non-IP/ICC or does not belong to the same IP/IC Community
, except when he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the Council of Elders/Leaders;
Where the relief sought for in the complaint or petition seeks to prevent any grave, imminent and irreparable damage or injury that may result if not acted upon immediately; and
Where the Council of Elders/Leaders refuse to issue the necessary certification without justifiable reasons. (Emphasis supplied)
These provisions support the conclusion that the NCIP has jurisdiction even over cases where a party does not belong to an ICC/IP.
However, it is a basic principle in administrative law that an administrative rule must conform to and not contradict the provision of an enabling law. In 
Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
:
[37]
As mandated by Article 7 of the Civil Code,
[38]
 an administrative rule or regulation cannot contravene the law on which it is based. . . . The rules and regulations that administrative agencies promulgate, which are the product of a delegated legislative power to create new and additional legal provisions that have the effect of law, should be within the scope of the statutory authority granted by the legislature to the objects and purposes of the law, and should not be in contradiction to, but in conformity with, the standards prescribed by law.
To be valid, an administrative rule or regulation must conform, not contradict, the provisions of the enabling law. An implementing rule or regulation cannot modify, expand, or subtract from the law it is intended to implement. Any rule that is not consistent with the statute itself is null and void.
While administrative agencies . . . may issue regulations to implement statutes, they are without authority to limit the scope of the statute to less than what it provides, or extend or expand the statute beyond its terms, or in any way modify explicit provisions of the law. Indeed, a quasi-judicial body or an administrative agency for that matter cannot amend an act of Congress. Hence, in case of a discrepancy between the basic law and an interpretative or administrative ruling, the basic law prevails.
[39]
The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act does not extend the NCIP's jurisdiction to disputes involving those who do not belong to ICCs/IPs. The precise wording of Section 66 and the silence of the remainder of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act on extending the NCIP's jurisdiction bear this out.
Likewise, "[j]urisdiction over a subject matter is conferred by law.
[40]
 No amount of administrative rule-making can vest jurisdiction where neither Constitution nor statute vests it.
Thus, Rule IX, Section 1 of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act's Implementing Rules and Regulations, Rule III, Section 5, and Rule IV, Sections 13 and 14 of the NCIP Rules, insofar as they extend the NCIP's jurisdiction to disputes where a party does not belong to an ICC/IP, must be deemed null and void. They are inconsistent with the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act in that they modify and expand the NCIP's jurisdiction as spelled out in Section 66. In light of this discrepancy between a basic law and administrative rules, the basic lawâthe Indigenous Peoples Rights Actâ must prevail.
VII
In sum, the requirements for the proper exercise of the NCIP's jurisdiction over a dispute, pursuant to Section 66 of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, are as follows:
 
 
(1) 
 
The claim or dispute must involve the rights of ICCs/IPs;
 
 
 
(2) 
 
Both parties must belong to the same ICC/IP;
 
 
 
(3) 
 
These parties must have exhausted all remedies provided under their ICC/IP's customary laws; and
 
 
 
(4)
 
 
Compliance with this requirement of exhausting remedies under customary laws must be evidenced by a certification issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute, to the effect that the dispute has not been resolved.
 
 
In this case, it is not disputed that respondents do not belong to an ICC/IP. Their sole interest is in their supposed ownership and possession of land which, in turn, "appears to be located within the ancestral domain of the Talaandig tribe."
[41]
 Thus, the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples may not exercise jurisdiction over the case filed by respondents.
VII
Customary norms are as varied as there are tribes within ethnolinguistic groups. If we are to animate the spirit of both the Constitution and the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act, we should not stereotype all cultures as homogenous or incapable of dynamic interfaces with each other. Customary law is a descriptive label which should acknowledge that each tribe lived through its own history and endogenously emerged their own set of norms reflecting their values and lifeways. To say that the customary norms of the Kalinga are the same as those of the Subanen betrays the same colonial mindset that marginalized what our colonizers called as "Non-Christian Tribes" in the distant past.
Neither should we straightjacket any culture as incapable of dynamic interfaces or accommodation with other cultures. Various groups of indigenous communities are able to work with the entirety of our legal system in appropriate cases. This case, which involves a party not of their tribe, is certainly one such case.

______________________________________
SEPARATE OPINION 
BRION, 
J
:
I concur with the 
ponencia's

 conclusion that the RTC has jurisdiction over the case. I write this 
Separate Opinion to express my own approach to the case, and to 
elaborate on relevant points that may need emphasis.
I base my concurrence on the following grounds:
(1) The CA correctly ruled that the RTC's February 14, 2005 order is not tainted with grave abuse;
(2) Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by law and the allegations of the complaint.
(3)
 The National Council for Indigenous Peoples' (NCIP) jurisdiction over 
disputes is limited to cases where both parties are members of the same 
ICC/IP.
I also concur with the 
ponencia
 that the NCIP has 
jurisdiction over adverse claims, boundary disputes, and cancellation of
 fraudulently issued Certificate of Ancestral Domain Titles (
CADTs
),
 regardless of the parties involved. But I clarify and emphasize my view
 that while the NCIP possesses quasi-judicial powers, its jurisdiction 
is only primary, and not exclusive.
The RTC's February 14, 2005 order is
NOT tainted with grave abuse of discretion.
The
 present petition is an appeal from the CA's dismissal of the 
petitioner's petition for certiorari. Hence, this Court must determine 
whether the CA correctly ruled that the RTC did not gravely abuse its 
discretion in issuing the February 14, 2005 order.
The 
petitioners alleged before the CA that the February 14, 2005 order is 
tainted with grave abuse because it: (i) denied the petitioners' motion 
to refer the case to the NCIP; (ii) declared the petitioners in default;
 and (iii) issued the writ of preliminary injunction.
[1]
Jurisprudence
[2]
 has traditionally defined grave abuse of discretion as follows:
Grave
 abuse of discretion is defined as capricious or whimsical exercise of 
judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of 
discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a 
positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or
 to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised 
in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.
Based
 on this definition, I share the view that the RTC did not abuse its 
discretion, much less commit any grave abuse of discretion.
At 
the time the respondents amended the complaint, the petitioners had yet 
to file their answers to the original complaint, hence, the amendment 
was still a matter of right. The rule on amendments as a matter of right
 applies to a co-defendant who has yet to file his responsive pleading, 
even if his co-defendants have already done so.
[3]

 Thus, while Macapayag and Brazil have filed their answers, the 
respondents still have the right to amend the complaint with respect to 
the rest of the petitioners.
Likewise, the RTC did not abuse its 
discretion in declaring the petitioners in default and in issuing the 
writ of preliminary injunction.
The RTC declared the petitioners 
in default only after they failed to file their answers within the 
period allowed. On the other hand, the writ of preliminary injunction 
sought to maintain the 
status quo
 to prevent both parties from committing further acts of violence; there is no caprice in maintaining the peace.
Nevertheless,
 default orders are issued on the presumption that the defendant no 
longer opposes the allegations and reliefs demanded in the complaint.
[4]

 In this case, the petitioners vehemently opposed the RTC's cognizance 
of the complaint, and refused to file their answers because they 
believed that jurisdiction belongs to the NCIP.
In the interest of justice, I support the CA in lifting the order of default to allow the parties to try the case on the merits.
Jurisdiction is determined 
by the allegations of the complaint
Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by law and by the material allegations of the complaint.
[5]

 Under these standards, the petitioner's argument, i.e., that the NCIP 
has jurisdiction because the case involves the rights of ICCs/IPs, is 
without merit.
As the 
ponencia 
pointed out, both the 
original and the amended complaints do not allege that the respondents 
were ICCs/IPs, or that the dispute involves an ancestral dominion.
[6]
 Hence, on the face of the respondents' complaint, the RTC has jurisdiction over the injunction case.
[7]
Neither
 am I impressed with the petitioners' argument that, where the actual 
issue is evidenced by the subsequent pleadings, jurisdiction does not 
depend on the complaint's literal averments. This Court has consistently
 ruled that jurisdiction never depends on the defenses set up in the 
answer, in a 
motion to dismiss
 or in a motion for reconsideration.
[8]
The NCIP's jurisdiction over disputes is limited
where both parties are members of the same ICC/IP.
I join the 
ponencia
 in ruling that the NCIP does not have jurisdiction over 
disputes
 where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP, or where the opposing parties are members of different ICC/IP.
My concurrence is based on the following: 
(i)
 Section 66 contains a proviso that limits the NCIP's jurisdiction; (ii)
 the RTC, not the NCIP, has jurisdiction to adjudicate violations of 
ICC/IP rights; (iii) Congress had no intention to apply customary laws 
to non-ICCs/IPs.
I. 
Section 66 contains a proviso that
limits the NCIP's jurisdiction.
The NCIP's jurisdiction is outlined in IPRA's Section 66:
SECTION 66. Jurisdiction of the NCIP. â The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and 
disputes
 involving rights of ICCs/IPs: Provided, however, That no such 
dispute
 shall be brought to the NCIP unless the 
parties
 have exhausted all remedies provided under 
their
 customary laws. 
For this purpose
,
 a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who 
participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not 
been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the
 filing of a petition with the NCIP. (
emphasis supplied
)
Section 66 is composed of three parts: the 
first
 states the NCIP's jurisdiction; the 
second
 requires the prior exhaustion of remedies under customary law; and the 
third

 states that a certification from the council of elders/leaders is a 
condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP.
The first part lays down the NCIP's jurisdiction, i.e., over all claims and disputes 
involving the rights of ICCs/IPs.
 The NCIP's jurisdiction is not dependent on who the parties are, but 
on whether the dispute involves the rights of ICCs/IPs.
However,
 the second part contains the 
proviso "Provided, However, That no such 
dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the 
parties 
have exhausted 
all remedies provided under their customary laws."
 The third part begins
 with the phrase "for this purpose"; the "purpose" referred to being the
 exhaustion of remedies under their customary laws.
Jurisprudence tells us that
 the office of a proviso is to limit the application of the law
.
[9]
Taking
 these considerations into account, while the NCIP's jurisdiction is 
initially couched in general terms to include any and all disputes 
involving the rights of ICCs/IPs, the second and third parts limit the 
NCIP's jurisdiction to disputes where both parties have remedies to 
exhaust under customary laws.
Consequently, the NCIP does not 
have jurisdiction over disputes involving non-ICCs/IPs because 
non-ICCs/IPs have no customary laws to exhaust.
The limitation likewise applies to disputes where the opposing parties are members of different ICCs/IPs.
Each
 ICC/IP has its own set of customary laws and council of elders/leaders.
 To require members of a particular ICC/IP to appear before the council 
of elders/leaders of another ICC/IP would be to require the former to 
observe the customary laws of the latter. This is repugnant to the right
 of each ICC/IP to use its own commonly accepted justice systems, 
conflict resolution institutions, and peace building processes or 
mechanisms.
[10]
II. 
The RTC not the NCIP, has
jurisdiction over violations of ICC/IP rights
committed by Non-ICC/IP.
As I had earlier discussed, 
the first part of Section 66 shows that jurisdiction is not dependent on who the parties are to the dispute, but on 
whether the dispute involves the rights of ICCs/IPs.
Guided by the rule that provisos should not be construed to limit the main provisions of the statute;
[11]

 this Court must not read Section 66 in isolation but must read it 
together with the related provision. In this case, the Court must 
identify the rights of ICCs/IPs, and determine whether the NCIP is the 
proper venue for the enforcement of these rights.
The IPRA grants ICCs/IPs rights: (i) over ancestral domains/lands;
[12]
 (ii) to self-governance and employment;
[13]
 (iii) to social justice and human rights;
[14]
 and (iv) to cultural integrity.
[15]
 These rights are spread throughout several chapters, mainly under Chapters III to VI.
It
 must be noted, however, that most of these rights are state policies, 
and 
only the following are clearly demandable and enforceable:
 the 
rights over ancestral domains and lands;
[16]
 the right against unlawful intrusion;
[17]
 the right to equal protection and to nondiscrimination;
[18]
 the right against unlawful acts pertaining to employment;
[19]
 the rights to religious, cultural sites and ceremonies, including archaeological artifacts;
[20]
 and the right to withhold access to biological and genetic resources.
[21]
Section 72 of the IPRA provides that 
any person
 who violates the rights of ICCs/IPs shall be punished "in accordance with the customary laws of the ICCs/IPs concerned....
without prejudice
 to the right of the ICC/IP concerned to avail of the protection of "
existing laws
... [i]n which case
" the penalty shall be imprisonment and/or fine, and damages, "
upon the discretion of the 
court
"
[22]
"Existing
 laws" refer to national laws as opposed to customary laws; while "the 
court" refers to the regular courts as opposed to administrative bodies 
like the NCIP.
Under Section 72, ICCs/IPs can avail of the protection under 
national laws
 and file an action before the 
regular courts
, in which case, the penalty shall be imprisonment and/or fine, and damages. 
From this perspective
, 
Section 72 is a special penal law that applies to ALL persons, including non-ICCs/IPs.
The phrase "without prejudice," however, fneans without limiting the course of action that one can take.
[23]
 Thus, a recourse under customary laws does not take away the right of ICCs/IPs to secure 
punishment under existing national laws
.
 An express caveat under the customary law option is that the penalty 
must not be cruel, degrading, or inhuman, nor shall it consist of the 
death penalty or excessive fines.
[24]
Since
 the regular courts, not the NCIP, have jurisdiction over national laws,
 then the NCIP's jurisdiction is limited to punishment under customary 
laws.
[25]
The NCIP's power to impose penalties under customary laws presents two important issues: 
first,
 whether it is legally possible to punish non-ICCs/IPs with penalties under customary laws; and 
second
, whether a member of a particular ICC/IP could be punished in accordance with the customary laws of another ICC/IP.
Laws that provide for fines, forfeitures, or 
penalties
 for their violation or otherwise impose a burden on the people, such as tax and revenue measures, must be published.
[26]
Most
 customary laws are not written, much less published. Hence, it is 
highly unlikely that the NCIP or even the regular courts have the power 
to penalize non-ICCs/IPs with these
 penalties 
under customary laws. A contrary ruling would be constitutionally infirm for lack of due process.
Similarly,
 an ICC/IP cannot be punished under the customary law of another. 
Otherwise, the former would be forced to observe a non-binding customary
 law.
Therefore, while the NCIP has jurisdiction over 
violations of ICC/IP rights, its jurisdiction is limited to those 
committed by and against members of the same ICC/IP.
This 
view does not detract from the IPRA's policy to "protect the rights of 
ICCs/IPs." ICCs/IPs, whose rights are violated by non-ICCs/IPs or by 
members of a different ICC/IP, can still file criminal charges before 
the regular courts. In this situation, the NCIP's role is not to 
adjudicate but to provide ICCs/IPs with "legal assistance in litigation 
involving community interest."
[27]
III. 
Congress had no intention to apply
 customary laws to non-ICCs/IPs.
Some
 might conceivably argue that Congress passed the IPRA and created the 
NCIP precisely to bind non-ICCs/IPs to customary laws.
I do not agree with this view.
The
 records of the Senate and the bicameral committee hearings show that 
the legislators focused mainly on: (i) the grant of Ancestral 
Domains/Lands to ICCs/IPs; (ii) the NCIP's organizational transition 
from its predecessor-agencies; and (iii) budgetary concerns. 
Section 66 's controversial proviso was not even discussed on the Senate floor or during the bicameral committee hearings.
In the course of the bill's
[28]
 early development, the Senate technical working group
[29]

 realized that it would be difficult for the NCIP to adjudicate rights 
of non-ICCs/IPs under national laws, on one hand, and the rights of 
ICCs/IPs under customary laws, on the other. They were likewise 
concerned with the possible conflict between the customary laws of 
contending ICCs/IPs.
As a solution, the Senate technical working 
group proposed the creation of the Office on Policy, Planning and 
Research (OPPR) and a Consultative Body that will compile all customary 
laws, and assist the NCIP in its exercise of quasi-judicial powers:
 
 
Mr. Mike Mercado
 (representative of Sen. Juan Flavier): 
 
Sir, it's over and above the customs and tradition. What I'm trying to pointout is, it's the whole plan for the sector. Two 
issues po ang sinasabi ko.
 Number one is regarding the need to put it down because we talked about conflict of rights here...
 
 
 
The Presiding Officer:
 
... With the Non-IPs.
 
 
 
Mr. Mercado: 
 
With
 the non-IPs possibly which would happen. It would be easy if the 
conflict could be between IPs of the same group. So it would be easier 
to resolve. But 
paano po 'yung
 if there would be a conflict between an IP and non-IP.
 
 
 
Mr. Raiz: 
 
Non-IP.
 
 
 
Mr. Mercado:
 
Because the assumption 
ngaâ oo, 'yong sa
 civil law relations, may mga conflicts
 po na possible na mangyayari.
 So, actually, 
sabi ko nga,
 
maybe we can do away with it. That's one issue
. xxx
 
 
 
Mr. Austria:
 
'Yong point ni 
Mike is very meritorious, 
'yon dapat, Dahil unang una,
 the IPs should themselves show to the other sectors 
kung ano ba 'yon rule nila sa society
.xxx
 
 
 
Ms. Damaso:
 
Let's go back to that discussion on the creation of a separate office on planning and policy, and research.

 I think it's more germane to mention those points that Mike has 
enunciated earlierâthat this be a primary function of that office xxx 
continuing
 documentation of customary laws customary law and other usage 'no for 
complete mediation or resolution, which would be derived from the 
culture base of the IPs
.
 
 
 
 
....
 
 
 
 
The presiding officer:
 
You were mentioning 
iyong other groups
. What about the commission? Should they be mandated to do the research and to, you know, to compile such laws.
 Kasi yung nakikita ko doon sa idea ni
 Mike is, like for example, kung may conflict iyong IPs and Non-IPs, 
paano
 mo sasabihin, although sasabihin natin na yung customary law nga yung 
mag-go-govern, pero paano natin i-po-proveâ-although kailangan natin 
i-recognize na mayroon ganuong problem.
 Sabihin natin it's an oral practice, it's an oral customary law 
pero mas maganda siguro kung iyon nga kung i-compile mo tapos eto ganito yon. So mayroon tayong pang...
 
 
 
Mr. Mercado:
 
For example po on practical ground, I think ang power is lodged with the Commission which is collective in nature 
iyong mga adjudicatory power. 
Assuming
 not all of them would belong to one tribe, they would belong to a 
different sector or group. I know that it is being practiced and it's 
not written down, so I have to make decision also as a part of that 
Commissionâas a commissioner based on something, so I have to also 
acquaint myself on the practices of other groups because that is part of
 the power of the commission to adjudicate. For practical purposes only,
 how would I know the practices of the particular groupings, which I am 
supposed to adjudicate, assuming that we only have 113 tribes or 
groupings and we have five commissioners. Those other five or those 
other commissioners who are not aware of that particular practice, to 
that they will depend their judgment on. So, there is also a need for 
this five commissioners to be familiar with the practice of other groups
 because they will make decisions also.
 
 
 
Ms. Damaso:
 
Yeah, Mike, I think your point is to compile, meaning document
.
 
 
 
Mr. Mercado:
 
Document only, hindi ho isabatas.
 
 
 
Ms. Damaso:
 
But not to codify. It's a different ball game to codify.
 
 
 
Mr. Mercado:
 
Actually 
ginamit ko yung term, nag-usap kami ni Didith, sabi ko
, "it's compile only".
 Because, it's beyond the power of this commission to make codifications.
 But '
yung point kanina ni Datu Sulang
 is actually going a step further.
 Kunwari

 like Muslims, bakit nare-recognize na 'yong three marriages Because 
there is four marriages and they have specific law for that.
 If we
 will not compile it, mahihirapan tayong ma-attain 'yong level na 'yon 
na sana mas maganda kung 'yong all practices, for example on marriage sa
 iba't ibang tribes ma-recognize rin ng law
. Pero if we will not document the practices, 
hindi natin maa-attain 'yong level na 'yon. Kaya mas maganda kung mayroon tayong 
documentation that when legislators if and when they decide to make it a law, mayroon silang existing na gagamitin. xxx
 
 
 
....
 
....
 
 
 
Ms. Chavez
 
Couldn't
 NCIP hire or form a consultative body from which each tribe will be 
represented by a co-tribal consultant aside from the documentation of 
customary laws?
 
Pwede ba 'yon ganoon?
 Kasi kahit may documentation.
.. (emphasis supplied)
 
 
 
The presiding officer: 
 
Baka pwede isama sa IRR
, implementing rules and regulations 
'yong mga
 tribal tribal consultancy.
 
 
 
Ms. Chavez: 
 
Sa IRR.
 
 
 
The Presiding officer:
 
Pwede naman siguro 'yon gawin
. Anyway, specifics na 'yon. General lang '
yong functions na ilagay natin.
 
 
 
 
x x x x
 
 
While
 the IPRA did create the OPPR, and directed the NCIP to form a 
consultative body, their functions had nothing to do with the NCIP's 
exercise of quasi-judicial powers.
The OPPR's objective is to document customary laws 
for monitoring, evaluation, and policy purposes to assist Congress in formulating appropriate legislations benefiting ICCs/IPs
.
[30]
 On the other hand, the consultative body's role is to advise the NCIP on matters "
relating to the problems, aspirations, and interests of the ICCs/IPs
."
[31]
The
 variance between the deliberations and the law suggests that Congress 
passed the IPRA without considering the inevitable conflict of rights 
under national and customary laws. In my opinion, this casts doubt on 
whether Congress did give the NCIP the mandate to settle disputes 
between non-ICCs/IPs and ICCs/IPs.
It is true that the IPRA echoed our Constitution
[32]
 in "
[recognizing] the applicability of customary laws
 governing property rights or relations in determining the ownership and extent of ancestral domain.
[33]

 However, I do not subscribe to the idea that customary laws should bind
 non-ICCs/IPs simply because Congress ordered the NCIP to compile them.
In 
Cruz v. Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources,
[34]
 former Associate Justice Jose C. Vitug opined
[35]
 that customary laws should not apply to non-ICCs/IPs simply because Congress parroted the Constitution:
The
 second paragraph of Section 5 of Article XII of the Constitution allows
 Congress to provide "for the applicability of customary laws governing 
property rights or relations in determining the ownership and extent of 
ancestral domains." 
I do not see this statement as saying that 
Congress may enact a law that would simply express that "customary laws 
shall govern" and end it there. Had it been so, the Constitution could 
have itself easily provided without having to still commission Congress 
to do it.
 Mr. Chief Justice Davide has explained this authority 
of Congress, during the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional 
Convention, thus: (emphasis supplied)
"
Mr. Davide.

 x x x Insofar as the application of the customary laws governing 
property rights' or relations in determining the ownership and extent of
 the ancestral domain is concerned, it is respectfully submitted that 
the particular matter must be submitted to Congress. I understand that 
the idea of Comm. Bennagen is for the possibility of the codification of
 these customary laws. So before these are codified, we cannot now 
mandate that the same must immediately be applicable. We leave it to 
Congress to determine the extent of the ancestral domain and the 
ownership thereof in relation to whatever may have been codified 
earlier. So, in short, let us not put the cart ahead of the horse."
15
The
 constitutional aim, it seems to me, is to get Congress to look closely 
into the customary laws and, with specificity and by proper recitals, to
 hew them to, and make them part of, the stream of laws.
 The "due process clause," as I so understand it in 
TaÃ±ada vs. Tuvera

 would require an apt publication of a legislative enactment before it 
is permitted to take force and effect. So, also, customary laws, when 
specifically enacted to become part of statutory law, must first undergo
 that publication to render them correspondingly binding and effective 
as such, (emphasis in the original)
I share Justice 
Vitug's view. Laws must be published before they take effect. The 
publication of all laws "of a public nature" or "of general 
applicability" is mandatory.
[36]
 Without publication, non-ICCs/IPs would be deprived of due process of law.
[37]
The NCIP has Primary Jurisdiction over Claims
regardless of whether the parties are non-ICCs/IPs,
or members of a different ICCs/IPs.
I note that Section 66 applies only to "disputes" and not to "claims":
SECTION 66. Jurisdiction of the NCIP. â The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all 
claims
 and 
disputes
 involving rights of ICCs/IPs: Provided, however, That no 
such dispute

 shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all 
remedies provided under their customary laws, xxx xxx (emphasis and 
omissions supplied)
The word "claim" in section 66 relates to rights of ICC/IP over ancestral domains/lands.
[38]
Four sections in the IPRA are dedicated to the NCIP's jurisdiction over "claims": 
first
, Section 52
 (h), which refers to the power of the NCIP Ancestral Domains Office (
NCIP-ADO
) to deny applications for CADTs; 
second
, Section 53
, which refers to the NCIP-ADO's power to reject applications for Certificate of Ancestral Land Titles(
CALTs
); 
third,
 Sec. 54, on fraudulent claims;
 
lastly
, Sec. 62
, which refers to the resolution of adverse claims.
Sections 52 (h) and 53 require the NCIP-ADO to publish and post applications for CADTs/CALTs to notify 
all persons,
 including non-ICCs/IPs. Section 62 allows 
all interested
 persons, including non-ICCs/IPs, to file adverse claims over disputes arising from delineation of ancestral domains.
[39]
Under
 Section 54, the NCIP may, upon the written request of ICCs/IPs, review 
existing claims and after notice and hearing, cancel CADTs and CALTs 
that were fraudulently acquired by 
any person
 or community.
[40]
In
 these cases, the NCIP has jurisdiction even if one of the parties is a 
non-ICC/IP, or where the opposing parties are members of different 
ICCs/IPs.
The NCIP's jurisdiction is 
primary and not exclusive.
Finally, I wish to point out that while the NCIP possesses quasi-judicial powers, its jurisdiction is not exclusive.
The
 word "jurisdiction" in the first part of Section 66 is unqualified. 
Section 66 (then Section 71) of Senate Bill 1728 was originally worded
 exclusive and original jurisdiction
.
[41]
 During the Bicameral Committee Conference,
[42]
 the lower house objected to giving the NCIP 
exclusive and original jurisdiction
:
 
 
Sen. Juan Flavier: 
 (Chairman of the 
 Senate Panel)
 
There is exclusive original. And so what do you suggest?
 
 
 
 
..... .... 
 
 
 
Rep. Zapata 
 (Chairman of the 
 Panel for the House
  of Representatives):
 
Chairman, may I butt in?
 
 
 
Sen. Flavier: 
 
Yes, please.
 
 
 
Rep. Zapata:
 
This
 was considered. The original, we were willing in the house. But the 
"exclusive", we objected to the word "exclusive" because it would only 
be the commission that would exclude the court and the Commission may 
not be able to undertake all the review nationwide. 
And so we remove 
the word "exclusive", so that they will have original jurisdiction but 
with the removal of the word "exclusive" that would mean that they may 
bring the case to the ordinary courts of justice
.
 
 
 
Sen. Flavier:
 
Without passing through the commission?
 
 
 
Rep. Zapata:
 
Yes.
 Anyway, if they go to the regular courts, they will have to litigate in
 court, because if its (sic) exclusive, that would be good.
 
 
 
Sen. Flavier:
 
But what he is saying is that... 
 
 
 
Rep. Zapata:
 
But they may not have the facility. 
 
 
 
Rep.______
 
Senado 
na lang. 
 
 
 
Rep. Zapata:
 
Oo,
 iyong original na lang.
 
 
 
Sen. Flavier:
 
In other words, it's not only the Commission that can originate it,
 pwedeng mag-originate sa courts.
 
 
 
Rep. Zapata
 
Or
 else, we just remove "exclusive original" so that they will say, the 
National will have jurisdiction over claims. So we remove both 
"exclusive and original".
 
 
 
Sen. Flavier:
 
So what version are you batting for, Mr. Chairman?
 
 
 
Rep. Zapata:
 
Just to remove the word "exclusive original." 
The
 Commission will still have jurisdiction only that, if the parties will 
opt to go to courts of justice, then this have (sic) the proper 
jurisdiction, then they may do so because we have courts nationwide
. Here there may be not enough courts of the commission.
 
 
 
Sen. Flavier:
 
So we are going to adopt the senate version minus the words "exclusive original"?
 
 
 
Rep. Zapata:
 
Yes, Mr. Chairman, that's my proposal.
 
 
 
Sen. Flavier:
 
No, problem. Okay Approved.
 
 
 
 
xxxx
 
 
The
 Bicameral Committee's removal of the words "exclusive and original" 
meant that the NCIP shares concurrent jurisdiction with the regular 
courts. Thus, I agree with the revised 
ponencia
 that it would be 
ultra vires 
for NCIP to promulgate rules and regulations stating that it has 
exclusive jurisdiction.
The NCIP's jurisdiction, however, while not exclusive, is primary.
Under
 the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, courts must refrain from 
determining a controversy involving a question which is within the 
jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal, where the question demands 
the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special 
knowledge, experience and services of the administrative tribunal to 
determine technical and intricate matters of fact.
[43]
On
 the other hand, when Congress confers exclusive jurisdiction to a 
judicial or quasi-judicial entity over certain matters by law, its 
action evinces its intent to exclude other bodies from exercising the 
same.
[44]
Having primary jurisdiction is not equivalent to having exclusive jurisdiction. 
Thus,
 to avoid confusion, and to prevent future litigants from claiming that 
the NCIP has exclusive jurisdiction, the Court should remind the NCIP 
and other administrative bodies to refrain from claiming that they have 
exclusive jurisdiction when no such jurisdiction is conferred by law.
Accordingly, the NCIP's Implementing Rules and Regulations, which state that the NCIP has exclusive jurisdiction
[45]
 should be modified to read "primary jurisdiction."
Conclusion
In
 sum, the law's intent is neither to grant the NCIP sole jurisdiction 
over disputes involving ICCs/IPs, nor to disregard the rights of 
non-ICCs/IPs under national laws. However, the NCIP maintains primary 
jurisdiction over: (i) adverse claims and border disputes arising from 
delineation of ancestral domains/lands; (ii) cancellation of 
fraudulently issued CADTs; and (iii) disputes and violations of ICCs/IPs
 rights between members of the same ICC/IP.
For these reasons, I vote to grant the petition. The RTC should forthwith continue with the injunction case.
