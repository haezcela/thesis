BRION, J.:*


We resolve the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by accused petitioner Paz T. Bernardo (
Bernardo
) under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Court of Appeals (
CA
) August 31, 2007 decision
[1]
 and the March 14, 2008 resolution
[2]
 in CA-G.R. CR 28721, entitled "People of the Philippines v. Paz T. Bernardo." The appellate court affirmed the decision of the Regional Trial Court (
RTC
), Branch 56, Makati City, finding Bernardo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of five (5) counts of violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (
B.P. 22
).
The Factual Antecedents
In June 1991, Bernardo obtained a loan from the private complainant Carmencita C. Bumanglag (
Bumanglag
) in the amount of P460,000.00 payable on or before its maturity on November 30, 1991. That loan was evidenced by a promissory note
[3]
 Bernardo and her husband had executed, whereby the couple solidarity bound themselves to pay the loan with corresponding interest at 12% per annum payable upon default.
[4]
 As additional security, Bernardo gave Bumanglag the owner's duplicate copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. (T-1034) 151841.
Prior to the loan's maturity, Bernardo took back the title from Bumanglag to use as a collateral in another transaction. In place of the title, Bernardo issued to Bumanglag the following five (5) Far East Bank and Trust Company (
FEBTC
) checks,
[5]
 posted on different dates in June 1992, covering the loan's aggregate amount:

FEBTC No. 391037 
 
Php 60,000.00
 
June 29, 1992
 
 
In September 1992, Bumanglag deposited these checks to Bernardo's account but they were dishonored; the reason given was "Account Closed." Bumanglag thus sent Bernardo a notice informing her of the dishonor of the checks. The demand went unheeded, prompting Bumanglag to initiate a criminal complaint against Bernardo with the Office of the City Prosecutor of Makati for five (5) counts of violation of B.P. 22.
After the requisite preliminary investigation, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Makati City found probable cause to indict Bernardo for the offenses charged. Bernardo entered a not guilty plea on arraignment.
The prosecution rested its case on September 21, 1994. Bernardo took the witness stand only on May 9, 1996, to present her defense evidence.
In her testimony, Bernardo argued that she could not be held liable for violation of B.P. 22 because the questioned checks were presented beyond the 90-day period provided under the law. She also denied having received any notice of dishonor, which she insisted was essential to prove the material element of knowledge of insufficiency of funds.
In any case, she maintained that the checks were never meant to be presented as she had always paid her loans in cash, which she claimed to have done in the aggregate amount of P717,000.00. According to Bernardo, although Bumanglag returned to her the title to the property after payment, Bumanglag never bothered to issue her receipts. Bumanglag did not return the checks either.
Following Bernardo's cross-examination, the RTC reset the hearing for redirect examination to September 4, 1996.
[6]
 That hearing, however, was again reset to April 3, 1997, in view of the absence of Bernardo's counsel. When Bernardo and her counsel again failed to appear during the April 3, 1997 hearing, and in view of the numerous previous postponements the defense had asked for, the RTC considered her right to present additional evidence waived.
Bernardo moved for reconsideration but the RTC denied her motion. The RTC, however, gave her ten (10) days within which to submit her formal offer of evidence, which she failed to do. As a result, the RTC declared that Bernardo had waived her right to submit her formal offer of evidence.
RTC Ruling
On May 28, 2003, the RTC issued its ruling finding Bernardo guilty of five counts of violation of B.P. 22.
[7]
 The RTC held that Bernardo failed to substantiate her claim of payment. The RTC further ruled that it is not the nonpayment of the obligation but the issuance of a worthless check that B.P. 22 punishes.
The RTC sentenced Bernardo to one (1) year imprisonment for each count of the offense charged and ordered her to indemnify Bumanglag the amount of P460,000.00, plus 12% interest and 5% penalty charges, from December 1, 1991, until full payment.
[8]
CA Ruling
On appeal, the CA affirmed Bernardo's conviction but deleted the penalty of imprisonment and in lieu thereof, imposed a P460,000.00 fine.
[9]
 The CA also retained the civil indemnity of P460,000.00 that the lower court imposed, plus 12% interest from the time of the institution of the criminal charges until full payment.
[10]
In denying Bernardo's appeal, the CA noted that Bernardo failed to adduce sufficient evidence of payment. The CA further held that the 90-day period within which to present a check under B.P. 22 is not an element of the crime.
The CA also did not recognize any merit in Bernardo's claim that she had been denied due process, in view of the RTC's order waiving her right to present additional evidence.
[11]
 To the CA, Bernardo had sufficient opportunity to present her defense but did not avail of these opportunities. Instead, she and her counsel moved for postponement at least nine (9) times, not to mention their subsequent failure to appear four (4) times despite due notice of the scheduled hearings. These developments led the RTC to consider Bernardo's right to present additional evidence waived.
[12]
Bernardo moved for reconsideration but the CA denied her motion;
[13]
 hence, the present petition.
[14]
The Petition and Comment
Bernardo insists in her present petition
[15]
 that the CA erred in finding that she had been accorded due process; she was denied the full opportunity to present her defense and was thus deprived of the chance to prove her innocence of the crime charged.
She likewise avers that the CA erred in affirming her criminal and civil liabilities because the prosecution failed to prove her knowledge of insufficiency of funds. According to Bernardo, there was no violation of B.P. 22 because the checks were presented beyond the mandatory 90-day period. Moreover, Bernardo claimed that these subject checks were issued without consideration as she had already paid the loan.
The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) posits in its Comment that Bernardo was given the opportunity to present her defense evidence.
[16]
 Citing 
Wong v. CA,
[17]
 the OSG further points out that the 90-day period provided in the law is not an element of the offense;
[18]
 it is simply one of the conditions to establish a
 prima facie
 presumption of knowledge of lack of funds.
[19]
The OSG also claims that Bumanglag failed to substantiate her claim that she had settled the obligation.
[20]
 In any event, the OSG asserted B.P. 22 penalizes the act of making and issuing a worthless check, not the nonpayment of the obligation.
[21]
Subsequent Developments
On March 14, 2011, Bernardo's counsel informed the Court of the petitioner's death on February 3, 2011, and provided, as well, the names of her heirs (her widower, Mapalad Bernardo, and children: Emilie B. Ko, Marilou B. Valdez, Edwin T. Bernardo, and Gervy B. Santos), and their address (26 Magdiwang St., Real Village 2, Tandang Sora, Quezon City). In due course, in our March 7, 2012 Resolution,
[22]
 we required Bernardo's heirs to appear as substitutes for the deceased Bernardo in the present petition for purposes of Bernardo's civil liability.
Bernardo's heirs moved to reconsider our March 7, 2012 resolution. They argued that Bernardo's death extinguished her civil liability. In the alternative, they contended that any civil liability should be settled in a separate civil case.
We denied the heirs' motion in our June 27, 2012 resolution. We explained that Bernardo's civil liability survived her death as it is based on contract. Moreover, we observed that it would be costly, burdensome, and time-consuming to dismiss the present case and require the Bumanglags to file a separate civil action.
The Court's Ruling 
We deny the petition for lack of merit. Preliminary Matters
Classes of Civil Liabilities
An act or omission causing damage to another may give rise to several distinct civil liabilities on the part of the offender.
[23]
 If the conduct constitutes a felony, the accused may be held civilly liable under Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code (
ex delicto
).
[24]
 This particular civil liability due the offended party is rooted on facts that constitute a crime.
[25]
 Otherwise stated, 
civil liability arises from the offense charged
.
[26]
 It is not required that the accused be convicted to be entitled to civil liability based on
 delict.
 As long as the facts constituting the offense charged are established by preponderance of evidence, civil liability may be awarded.
[27]
 Moreover, the civil liability based on 
delict 
is deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately, or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action.
[28]
The same act or omission, however, may also give rise 
to independent civil liabilities
 based on other sources of obligation. Article 1157 of the Civil Code enumerates these other sources of obligation from which the civil liability may arise as a result of the same act or omission: (a) law (b) contracts; (c) quasi-contracts, and (d) quasi-delicts. Among these are the civil liabilities for intentional torts under Articles 32
[29]
 and 34
[30]
 of the Civil Code and for 
quasi-delicts 
under Article 2176 of Civil Code.
[31]
 For conduct constituting defamation, fraud, and physical injuries, the Civil Code likewise grants the offended party the right to institute a civil action independently of the criminal action under Article-33 of the Civil Code.
Thus, it is entirely possible for one to be free from civil ability directly arising from a violation of the penal law and to still be liable civilly based on contract or by laws other than the criminal law.
[32]
 Such civil actions may proceed independently of the criminal proceedings and regardless of the result of the criminal action,
[33]
 subject however, to the caveat that the offended party cannot recover damages twice for the same act or omission.
[34]
Bernardo's civil liability may be 
enforced in the present case despite 
her death.
As a general rule, the death of an accused pending appeal extinguishes her criminal liability and the corresponding civil liability based solely on the offense (delict). The death amounts to an acquittal of the accused based on the constitutionally mandated presumption of innocence in her favor, which can be overcome only by a finding of guilt - something that death prevents the court from making.
[35]
 In a sense, death absolves the accused from any earthly responsibility 
arising from the offense
 â a divine act that no human court can reverse, qualify, much less disregard.
[36]
 The intervention of death of the accused in any case is an injunction by fate itself so that no criminal liability and the corresponding civil liability arising from the offense should be imposed on him.
[37]
The independent civil liabilities, however, survive death and an action for recovery therefore may be 
generally
 pursued but only by filing a separate civil action and subject to Section 1, Rule 111 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure as amended.
[38]
 This separate civil action may be enforced against the estate of the accused.
[39]
In B.P. 22 cases, the criminal action shall be deemed to include the corresponding civil actions. Instead of instituting two separate cases, only a single suit is filed and tried.
[40]
 This rule was enacted to help declog court dockets, which had been packed with B.P. 22 because creditors used the courts as collectors. As we observed in 
Hyatt v. Asia Dynamic Electrix Corp.
:
[41]
Because ordinarily no filing fee is charged in criminal cases for actual damages, the payee uses the intimidating effect of a criminal charge to collect his credit 
gratis
 and sometimes, upon being paid, the trial court is not even informed thereof. The inclusion of the civil action in the criminal case is expected to significantly lower the number of cases filed before the courts for collection based on dishonored checks. It is also expected to expedite the disposition of these cases. Instead of instituting two separate cases, one for criminal and another for civil, only a single suit shall be filed and tried. It should be stressed that the policy laid down by the Rules is to discourage the separate filing of the civil action.
As a necessary consequence of this special rule, the civil liabilities arising from the issuance of a worthless check are deemed instituted in a case for violation of B.P. 22; the death of Bernardo did not automatically extinguish the action. The independent civil liability based on contract, which was deemed instituted in the criminal action for B.P. 22, may still be enforced against her estate in the present case. We thus rule on the present action to determine Bumanglag's civil liability.
Substantive Aspect
Bernardo was not denied due process.
We meticulously went over the entire record, and confirmed that Bernardo had not at all been deprived of her day in court. She was afforded ample opportunity to present evidence in her defense but she did not give this case the serious attention it deserved. For good reason - 
i.e.
, the repeated absences of Bernardo and her counsel - the trial court eventually considered her right to present defense evidence waived.
To be sure, the postponement of the trial of a case to allow the presentation of evidence is a matter that lies with the discretion of the trial court; but it is a discretion that must be exercised wisely, considering the peculiar circumstances of each case and with a view to doing substantial justice.
[42]
 In the present case, the records show that the RTC took all the steps necessary to safeguard Bernardo's rights and to accord her the opportunity to present whatever evidence she had in her defense.
In particular, the prosecution formally rested its case on September 21, 1994. Bernardo, through counsel, thereupon moved for leave to file a demurrer to evidence prompting the RTC to reset the hearing for initial presentation of defense evidence to December 15 and 20, 1994.
[43]
 Bernardo filed her demurrer to evidence on November 10, 1994,
[44]
 after previously requesting the RTC for a 10-day extension.
The pendency of the demurrer to evidence prompted several resettings until the RTC finally denied it on March 30, 1995.
[45]
 The RTC then set the initial presentation of defense evidence on April 11, 18, and 25, 1995,
[46]
 but these were reset to May 9, 18, and 25, 1995,
[47]
 at the motion of Bernardo's counsel who expressed his desire to seek relief from the CA for the denial of the demurrer.
Despite the RTC's accommodation, 
Bernardo's counsel failed to appear during the May 9, 1995 hearing as he was busy attending to the canvassing of votes in Quezon City
.
[48]
 Eventually, the initial presentation of defense evidence was reset to July 20, 1995, and August 3, 1995.
[49]
Notably, during the July 20, 1995 hearing, Bernardo's counsel again moved for another resetting as he 
was not prepared to conduct a direct examination.
[50]
 Despite this flimsy ground, the RTC granted the request and allowed Bernardo to testify on August 3, 1995.
Bernardo and her counsel, however, failed to appear
 during the August 3, 1995 hearing despite due notice, prompting the RTC to waive their right to present defense evidence.
[51]
 Bernardo moved for reconsideration and the RTC granted her motion in the interest of substantial justice.
[52]
 Thus, the hearing for the presentation of defense evidence was reset to November 28, 1995.
[53]
Bernardo and her counsel again failed to appear during the November 28, 1995 hearing, despite due notice,
 prompting the RTC again to consider that Bernardo had waived her right to present defense evidence.
[54]
Bernardo again moved for reconsideration on the ground that it was the first time she and her counsel were absent at the same time
.
[55]
 Despite this hollow excuse, the RTC granted the motion 
in the spirit of compassionate justice
 and gave Bernardo the 
final opportunity
 to present her defense evidence.
[56]
 The parties mutually agreed to set the hearing for initial presentation of defense evidence on April 18, 1996.
[57]
Bernardo again failed to appear
 during the scheduled April 18, 1996 hearing.58 Although Bernardo did not offer any excuse for this absence,
[59]
 RTC exercised compassion and permitted Bernardo to testify, as she did in fact testify, on May 9, 1996,
[60]
 - one (1) year and eight (8) months after the prosecution had rested its case. At the conclusion of the cross-examination, 
the parties mutually agreed
 to adjourn the hearing for September 4, 1996, for redirect examination.
[61]
Bernardo's counsel, however, failed to appear during the scheduled September 4, 1996 hearing, prompting the RTC to consider her failure as a waiver on her part to present additional evidence.
[62]
 Bernardo moved for reconsideration; she claimed that her counsel had to attend another hearing in a different sala. Why Bernardo's counsel accepted another engagement on the same day, which was in conflict with the RTC's hearing dates, was never properly explained. Nonetheless, 
the RTC granted the motion to give her the 
last chance
 to complete the presentation of evidence on April 3, 17, and 22, 1997
.
[63]
Despite the RTC's warning, Bernardo and her counsel again failed to appear at the April 3,1997 hearing
.
[64]
 Instead, they filed a motion to reset because Bernardo's counsel was to attend a wedding in the United States of America.
[65]
 This time, the RTC, mindful that there should be a limit to postponements, ordered the case submitted for decision sans the presentation of evidence from the defense.
[66]
Under these facts, the RTC was clearly driven by Bernardo and her counsel's repeated failure, without justifiable reason, to appear at the scheduled hearing dates.
[67]
 The order considering Bernardo's right to present evidence waived, followed as a necessary and unavoidable consequence. As we held in 
People v. Angco
:
[68]
His failure to appear with counsel of his choice at the hearing of the case, notwithstanding repeated postponements and warnings that failure to so appear would be deemed a waiver to present evidence in his defense, and that the case would be deemed submitted for judgment upon the evidence presented by the prosecution, was sufficient legal justification for the trial court to proceed and render judgment upon the evidence before it.
The records show that the RTC leniently granted repeated continuances to safeguard Bernardo's rights as an accused. But Bernardo obviously did not recognize the need for expeditious handling of her case and was already trifling with judicial process.
[69]
Bernardo failed to adduce sufficient 
evidence of payment; thus she is civilly
liable.
Bernardo's death 
pending appeal 
converted the present action to purely an enforcement of the civil liability incurred. In particular, 
the focal issue in the present petition is no longer Bernardo's criminal liability for violation of B.P. 22 but her civil liability, which is principally based on contract and the corresponding damage Bumanglag suffered due to Bernardo's failure to pay
. Under these circumstances, Bernardo's B.P. 22 defense (that the checks were presented beyond the 90-day period and that she never received a notice of dishonor) were no longer relevant.
Jurisprudence tells us that one who pleads payment carries the burden of proving it.
[70]
 Indeed, once the existence of an indebtedness is established by evidence, the burden of showing with legal certainty that the obligation has been discharged by payment rests with the debtor.
[71]
 After the debtor introduces evidence of payment, the burden of going forward with the evidence - as distinct from the general burden of proof - again shifts to the creditor, who then labors under a duty to produce evidence to show nonpayment.
[72]
In the present case, the existence of the obligation to pay has sufficiently been established through the promissory note
[73]
 and the checks
[74]
 submitted in evidence. Notably, Bernardo even confirmed due execution of these instruments during her testimony. During the offer of Bernardo's testimony, her counsel stated:
ATTY. MIRAVITE:
With the court's permission. Your Honor, we are presenting the witness for the following purposes: to x x x show that she borrowed money from [Bumanglag] x x x 
and that in 1991 her total obligation reached Php460,000.000; x x x that all the checks issued by the accused were only as proof of her obligation to the private complainant
 x x x.
[75]
  [emphasis supplied]
In the course of Bernardo's testimony, she even confirmed the issuance of the checks and promissory note. In particular, she stated:
ATTY. MIRAVITE:
Q: I am showing to you this promissory note marked as Exhibit H for the prosecution and Exhibit 2 for the defense. There appears a signature over the name Paz T. Bernardo at the middle portion thereof, do you know whose signature is that?
A: It is mine sir.
x x x x
Q: This document, Madame Witness, mentions of your loan obligations of Php 460,000.00. Can you tell us, Madame Witness, what is covered by this promissory note?
x x x x
A: The promissory note covers the principal loan, plus interest and penalties, sir.
Q: So, are you saying that this promissory note of Php 460,000.00 was your total obligation as of June 1991 and includes all other charges?
A: Yes, sir.
x  x x x
Q: Madam Witness, can you remember when you issued the checks subject of these cases?
A: It was on June 20, 1991, sir.
[76]
Bernardo's principal defense rests on the supposition that she had settled the obligation, which settlement led Bumanglag to return to her the title to the property.
[77]
 A meticulous review, of the records, however, firmly dissuades us from believing Bernardo's bare allegation.
At the outset, the handwritten note
[78]
 evidencing that transaction, which was submitted by the prosecution in evidence, states that:
                                                                                                          10/28/91
Received original copy of Title No. T-151841 in the name of Mapalad Bernardo for loan purposes to pay Mrs. Carmencita Bumanglag
                                                                                                           Sgd
                                                                                                          Paz T. Bernardo
                                                                                                         10/28/91
The document evidencing this transaction strongly suggests that she asked for the title from Bumanglag to obtain another loan whose proceeds she would use to pay Bumanglag. Notably, the defense even admitted the genuineness of Bernardo's signature in this document.
[79]
 When Bernardo therefore failed to fulfill her promise to pay, Bumanglag had to request for checks to secure the obligation, which checks were eventually dishonored upon presentment.
Under the circumstances, we find that Bernardo's claim of payment was nothing more than an allegation unsupported by adequate proof. If indeed there had been payment, she should have redeemed or taken back the checks and the promissory note, in the ordinary course of business.
[80]
 Instead, the checks and the promissory note remained in the possession of Bumanglag, who had to demand the satisfaction of Bernardo's obligation when the checks became due and were subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank. Bumanglag's possession of the promissory note, coupled with the dishonored checks, strongly buttresses her claim that Bernardo's obligation had not been extinguished.
[81]
We thus find that the weight of evidence preponderates in favor of Bumanglag's position that Bernardo has not yet settled her obligation.
[82]
