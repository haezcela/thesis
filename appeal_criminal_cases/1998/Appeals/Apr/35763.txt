THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS.
DENNIS DE GUZMAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




ROMERO, J.:


The Court is once again confronted with the dilemma of having to choose
between the testimony of a mother and her teen-age son and that of the man they
claim is responsible for the violent demise of their familyâs breadwinner and
first-born son.


For the death of Ernesto Trilles and his son Edwin, accused-appellant
Dennis de Guzman and two others who remain at large
[1]
 
were charged with two counts of
murder
[2]

before the Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City on June 14, 1994, to wit:


âThat on or about the 13th
day of April, 1994, in the City of Legazpi, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, all armed with
handguns, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another for a
common purpose, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously and
with treachery and abuse of superior strength, shoot with a handgun one ERNESTO
TRILLES,
[3]
 thereby inflicting upon the latter injuries
which directly caused his death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.


CONTRARY TO LAW.â


At the trial, the prosecution presented the testimonies of Rosita
and Anthony Trilles to shed light on the incident.  Their combined narration follows.


On the night of April 13, 1994, while Rosita was preparing supper
in their modest home at Sitio Malangka, Taysan, Legazpi City, a young man whom
she knew by face but whose name she did not know barged in through the kitchen
door and shot her husband Ernesto in the head with a short firearm.  As Ernesto lay sprawled on the kitchen
floor, the man shot him again on the chest.
[4]

The man, who was later identified as accused-appellant Dennis de Guzman, then
faced the horrified oldest son and asked him if he was Edwin.  When the latter said âyes,â he too was shot
and hit near the collar bone.
[5]

Before he was shot, his uncle who was Rositaâs brother, Loreto Aringo, was seen
near the eaves of the house.  Addressing
him, Edwin pleaded for his life saying, â
Tio
, do not shoot me.  I did not do anything wrong.â  Because Edwin had punched him the night
before, Aringo ignored his nephew and even egged on the gunman, shouting, â
Anong
tio-tio gadanon an
 (What 
Tio
, 
Tio
, he should be killed).â
[6]

Anthony, the other son of Rosita who was hiding under the table, heard his
brother pleading with de Guzman, âDonât kill me 
Tio
.â
[7]


In a short while, Rosita fled and on her way out, espied her
cousin, Adriano Casiban, standing near the kitchen door.
[8]

Then she heard more gunshots, the same gunshots heard by Anthony who at the
time was still under the table.
[9]

Like his mother, he, too, was allowed to escape by his uncles and the man whose
name he did not know but whom he knew was staying with his uncle Adriano.  Rosita sought refuge at the house of her
sister, Hedelyn Bandoquillo and spent the night there.  This was confirmed by the latter, who
testified as a rebuttal witness for the prosecution.
[10]


In the morning, Rosita reported the incident to Barrio Captain
Nelson Aringo, another cousin, who accompanied her to the police
headquarters.  Mother and son failed to
mention the names of Aringo and Casiban to the police during the investigation,
and both declared at the time that the suspect was unknown or unidentified.
[11]

When confronted later with these earlier statements, they explained that at the
time of the incident, although they recognized the face of Dennis de Guzman,
they were not aware of his identity, which is why they told the police that the
suspect was unknown or unidentified.
[12]

In her confusion, Rosita even said that it was Casiban who shot the boy.  Later, she was not even sure if Casiban
fired a gun or if he had a gun at all, because she was at the moment already
running away.
[13]


Aringo and Casiban, having gone into hiding, only the defense of
de Guzman was heard at the trial.  Dennis de Guzman denied all the accusations against him and set up an
alibi for his defense.  He relied on the
testimonies of four witnesses, all close friends of his family,
[14]

to support his story that on the date and time of the occurrence, he was at a
party at San Jose, Maslog, Legazpi City, which is about three kilometers from
Taysan.
[15]


Dennis de Guzman claimed that he and his mother Adelina went to
her hometown of San Jose, Maslog, Legazpi City on April 5, 1994, to visit his
ailing grandmother.  They stayed with
his grandmother whose name he did not even know, and during his free time, he
helped with some chores and played with friends like Charlie Padilla.  On April 13, 1994, Charlieâs mother
Estelita, a childhood friend of Adelinaâs, celebrated her 52th birthday, and
she decided to treat her town mates to a free dance.  Charlie, Dennis, and her brothers, Felicito and Jerry Watiwat,
helped in setting up the light and sound systems for the dance.  They started at around 3:00 oâclock in the
afternoon and finished by 6:30 p.m.  After a dinner break at 7:00 oâclock, the two youngsters manned the
music station until midnight.
[16]

On cross-examination, de Guzman admitted that his mothersâ sister Lolita was
the wife of Adriano Casiban.
[17]


Hedelyn Bandoquillo was presented by the prosecution to debunk de
Guzmanâs claim that he stayed with his grandmother when he was in the province.  She said that on at least four occasions,
she saw him at his uncle Adrianoâs house at Sitio Polot, Taysan, Legazpi City,
which is about half a kilometer from Sitio Malangka and was sure he was staying
there.
[18]


After trial on the merits, Judge Gregorio A. Consulta of the
Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City, Branch 4, rendered judgment, the decretal
portion of which reads thus:


âWHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing findings and left no
choice but to follow in complete obedience the stenosis of a rigorous law that
in spirit demands an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, (LEX TALIONIS) after
being convinced beyond a wisp of a doubt of the guilt of accused DENNIS DE
GUZMAN, he is hereby sentenced to suffer in Criminal Case No. 6717 the penalty
of  


DEATH 


and likewise to suffer in Criminal Case No.
6718 the penalty of 


DEATH 


and to indemnify Rosita Trilles and Anthony
Trilles in the sum of P100,000.00 in each case.


With respect to Loreto Aringo and Adriano Casiban who are at large,
let a complete reproduction by XEROX of the complete records of both cases be
sent to the ARCHIVE, in lieu of the originals which are hereby ordered
transmitted within twenty (20) days from promulgation to the Hon. Supreme Court
on automatic review together with the person of DENNIS DE GUZMAN who shall be
confined at the National Penitentiary in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila pending final
resolution of such review.


Issue alias warrants for the arrest of Loreto Aringo and Adriano
Casiban pursuant to existing circular on the matters and the cases shall be
revived, insofar as they are concerned, upon their apprehension or of any of
them.


The Clerk of Court is directed to provide the necessary expenses
for the reproduction of the records by XEROX.


SO ORDERED.â


In this automatic review, Dennis de Guzman argues that the trial
court erred in appreciating the evidence and in concluding that he was
positively identified by the prosecution witnesses.


After going through the records and evidence of this case, we are
convinced that Dennis de Guzman was correctly convicted by the trial court for
the death of Ernesto and Edwin Trilles.


Accused-appellant makes much of the failure of the eyewitnesses
to give his name or even his description during the initial police investigation
of the incident.  When Rosita reported
the shooting of her husband and son to the police in the morning of April 14,
1994, she stated that they were shot by an âunknown suspect,â and made no
mention of either her older brother Loreto Aringo or her cousin Adriano
Casiban.
[19]

For his part, Anthony executed an affidavit dated April 19, 1994, referring to
the assailant as an âunidentified man.â  He also did not implicate his uncles, Aringo or Casiban.
[20]


The Court believes that the eyewitnesses to the crimes did
identify accused-appellant as the man who shot the victims.  In the first place, when they testified at
the trial they positively pointed out to de Guzman as the malefactor.
[21]

Any doubt cast by their earlier statements was laid to rest when they were put
on the witness stand.  In the case of 
Jacobo
v. Court of Appeals
,
[22]

we affirmed the doctrine that an affidavit cannot prevail over testimonial
evidence uttered in open court,
 viz
.:


ââAn affidavit being taken 
ex
parte
 is almost always incomplete and often inaccurate, sometimes from
partial suggestion, and sometimes from want of suggestion and inquiries,
without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected
collateral circumstances necessary for the correction of the first suggestion of
his memory and for his accurate recollection of all that belongs to the
subject.ââ
[23]


Thus, while an affiant usually merely
signs an affidavit which was prepared by another, in this case,
[24]

the Assistant City Prosecutor, a witness testifies in court with more
spontaneity, drawing from a memory no  longer befuddled by the initial shock of the occurrence, uttering his
own words with minimum guidance or coaxing.  If testimonial evidence is superior to an affidavit, then with more
reason should it prevail over a mere police report which is not even under
oath.


In the second place, in her affidavit dated April 19, 1994,
[25]

Rosita made a more complete narration of the incident and implicated Aringo and
Casiban.  She even managed to identify
de Guzman by his surname.
[26]

Anthony, on the other hand, stated in his affidavit that although the suspect
was unidentified, he could recognize the latter if spotted, and that is
precisely what he did when he testified on November 8, 1995.


Finally, when confronted with their initial reports, both
witnesses explained that although they said the suspect was unknown or
unidentified, they were merely referring to his name.  As far as physical attributes were concerned, they had no doubt
that they could recognize the man who snuffed out the life of their loved ones
in the blink of an eye.  


Through all these, de Guzman could only deny the charges and come
up with an alibi which falls short of the standards set through time for its
acceptability as a foolproof defense.


He was allegedly at the dance held at San Jose, Maslog, Legazpi
City when the crime was being committed at Sitio Malangka, Taysan.  Yet, the records show that Maslog is a mere
three kilometers from Taysan and there are even well-trodden shortcuts which
could drastically reduce travel time from one town to the other.  If anything, it signifies that it was still 
possible

for him to have been at the crime scene even as he claims that he was elsewhere
at the time.  In this regard, his
defense of alibi must fail.
[27]


Furthermore, the positive identification of de Guzman as the man
who shot the victims cannot be overcome by his denial and alibi.  The fact that he was not immediately named
by the eyewitnesses when they reported the incident to the police is likewise
of no moment considering that they knew him by face and even identified him in
open court.  As we reiterated in the
recent case of  
Bautista v. Court of
Appeals
:
[28]


ââPositive identification,
where categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the
part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter, prevails over alibi and denial
which if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence are negative and
self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law.ââ
[29]


In view of these disquisitions, the Court agrees with the court

a quo
 that the guilt of Dennis de Guzman in the slaying of Ernesto and
Edwin Trilles on the night of April 13, 1994, has been proved by the
prosecution beyond any reasonable doubt. 


The Court, however, differs with the trial court in its
imposition of the death penalty in the two cases under review.  It must be noted that this penalty was
decreed because â(f)irearms were used, as alleged in the (i)nformation.â
[30]

It is undeniable that an accused cannot be held liable for a crime not alleged
in the information, and the information filed by the prosecution in this case
was for murder qualified by treachery, not for murder with the use of an
unlicensed firearm.


Under R.A. No. 7659, the crime of murder shall be punished by 
reclusion
perpetua
 to death if committed with, among other circumstances, treachery,
as that alleged in the information dated June 14, 1994.  We agree with the court 
a quo
 that

alevosia
 attended the commission of the crime and that this has been duly
proved by the Peopleâs evidence.  The
Trilles family was preparing to sup on the night of April 13, 1994, when de
Guzman suddenly barged into their house from the kitchen door and, without
uttering a word, shot Ernesto, not once, but twice.  With the same coldbloodedness, he shot Edwin even after the boy
pleaded for his life.  Neither of the
victims was armed at the time, and they could not have resisted the attack even
if they wanted to because of its suddenness and precision.  At no time was de Guzman open to retaliation
by his victims.  As we held in 
Bautista
:


ââAn unexpected and sudden
attack under circumstances which render the victim unable and unprepared to
defend himself by reason of the suddenness and severity of the attack
constitutes 
alevosia
, and the fact that the attack was frontal does not
preclude the presence of treachery.ââ
[31]


Apart from treachery, we find no other circumstance, aggravating
or mitigating, which would affect the imposition of the appropriate penalty in
the case at bar.  Under these premises,
therefore, the punishment that may be properly meted out against the
accused-appellant is the lesser penalty of 
reclusion perpetua

because  â(w)hen there are (as in this
case) neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the
deed, the lesser penalty shall be applied.â
[32]


WHEREFORE
, the assailed decision dated June 6, 1996, in
Criminal Case No. 6717 and No. 6718 is hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION
that the penalty is reduced from death to 
reclusion perpetua
 in both
cases for the reasons aforestated and the indemnity to Rosita Trilles and
Anthony Trilles reduced to 
P
 50,000.00 each  Costs against accused-appellant.
