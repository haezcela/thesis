VS. REX BERGANTE, RODITO BERGANTE, AND LEO BERGANTE, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.

D E C I S I O N




DAVIDE, JR., J.:


Accused-appellants
Rex, Rodito, and Leo, all surnamed Bergante, were charged with the crime of
murder in Criminal Case No. 86-6371 and with the crime of illegal possession of
firearms in Criminal Case No. 86-6548, which were consolidated and jointly
tried before Branch 49 of the Regional Trial Court of Palawan sitting in Puerto
Princesa.  


The evidence for
the prosecution was summarized by the Office of the Solicitor General in the
Appelleeâs Brief, thus: 


In the afternoon of February 14,
1986, the victim Donato Genanda, Sr. was in a rice mill situated in Barangay
Bato, Taytay, Palawan (pp. 10, 21, TSN, April 21, 1987).  He was in the company of Renato Estrella who
helped in having his 
palay
 milled (pp. 11, 20-22, 
ibid
.)  Appellant Rodito Bergante arrived there to
buy rice from the victim (p. 11, 
ibid
.).


After the victim had given
appellant Rodito a 
ganta
 of rice and the milling finished, Estrella left
ahead for home (p. 23, 
Ibid
.).  Then the victim who rode on his carabao left followed by appellant
Rodito (p. 23, 
ibid
.).  After
negotiating a certain distance, Estrella looked back and saw the victim and
appellant Rodito conversing in front of the house of one Marvin Famine (p. 24, 
ibid
.).  Estrella returned to find out what seemed to
be the problem between the victim and appellant Rodito (p. 24, 
ibid
.).  It turned out that the two were discussing
about Roditoâs cow which was destroying the victimâs 
palay
 (p. 24, 
ibid
.).  The victim suggested that Rodito should tie
his cow (p. 24, 
ibid
.).


After a while, the victim and
Estrella left together on their way home (p. 25, 
ibid
.).  Appellant Rodito also left (
Ibid
.).  After negotiating a distance of about 65
meters, Rodito met his brothers Rex and Leo on the way (p. 28, 
ibid
.).


When the victim and Estrella
reached a distance of about 10 meters away from the house of one Jesus Genanda,
they saw the three (3) appellants, who had taken a shortcut, waiting in front
of said house (p. 28, 
ibid
.).  At
once, Estrella warned the victim:  âNinong watch out, they are waiting for youâ (pp. 5, 29, 
ibid
.).  The victim merely retorted:  âWhy should I be afraid of them, I have not
done anything wrongâ (p. 6, 
ibid
.).  Having sensed that the three (3) appellants are [
sic
] out to
waylay them, Estrella fearfully hid behind the bushes.  (p. 6, 
ibid.
; p. 20, TSN August 26,
1987).  He watched what happened
thereafter from the hiding place (
Ibid.)
.


The victim went on his way.  Upon reaching the place where the three (3)
appellants were situated, appellant Rex suddenly shot the victim at the
abdominal area (p. 6, 
ibid
.).  The victim fell from his carabao.  Appellant Rodito got a piece of 
bakawan 
(mangrove) and hit the
victim on the head (
Ibid
.).  Almost simultaneously, appellant Leo grabbed the bolo of the victim and
with it pierced (
tinusok
) the latterâs eyes (p.7, 
ibid
.).


The victim was lying prostrate on
the ground face up and still groaning when the three (3) appellants fled
towards the direction of their house (p. 9, 
ibid
.).  On the way home, they met their father,
Restituto Bergante, who inquired: 
Te napatay nyo na
 (p. 9, 
ibid
.).


When Donato Genanda, Jr., son of
the victim, was informed by Renato Estrella that his father had been attacked
by the Bergante brothers, he immediately ran to the place of the incident (p.
18, Oct. 27, 1987).  There, he saw his
father lying flat on the ground [with] blood oozing from his forehead and face,
a wound at the left side of his body, and one eye protruding, as if it had been
pierced by a sharp instrument (p. 19, 
ibid
.).  His father who was still conscious told his son Donato that it
was appellant Rex who shot him followed by Rodito who clubbed him and Leo who
had pierced his eyes (p. 19, 
ibid
.).


Donato Genanda Jr., lost no time in
bringing his father to the Hospital on board a jeep (p. 23, 
ibid
.).  While inside the jeep, and again in the
hospital, his father kept repeating that it was the three (3) appellants who
had attacked him (pp. 24-25, 
ibid
.).  The victim stayed in the hospital for about 24 hours before he died (p.
26, 
ibid
.).


Sgt. Juan Oscillada of the
Philippine Constabulary conducted the investigation of the case upon
instruction of the Provincial Commander (pp. 3-4, TSN, April 21, 1987).  After the complaint was filed against the
four (4) [
sic
] appellants and warrant of arrest was issued to effect
their arrest, he was able to arrest the four [
sic
] appellants (pp. 6-7, 
ibid
.)  When he arrested appellant Rex Bergante, he
was able to recover from him a Revolver Cal. 32 with Serial No. 497826 (Exhibit
âBâ) with two (2) empty shells (Exhibits âCâ and âC-1â).


A verification from the Firearm and
Explosive Unit, Camp Crame, shows the four (4) [
sic
] appellants are not
licensed firearms holders  of any
caliber (Exhibit âJâ).
[1]


The Autopsy
Report signed by Dr. Nestor A. Reyes reveals the following findings:


1.

embalmed by formalin.


2.

7.
       
Stab wound sutured

[2]


The
accused-appellants, on the other hand, put up alibi for their exculpation.  Rodito Bergante testified that at 7:00 a.m. of
14 February 1986, he went to his land in Sitio Cugon, Bato, to âmake 
kaingin
â;
he stayed there the whole day and went home to Barangay Bato at 6:00 p.m.
[3]
 Leo Bergante declared that at about
4:00 p.m. of that same day, he was in his house in Barangay Bato and that from
4:30 to 5:30 p.m. he was in the rice mill of one Marvin Pamines to buy the rice
bran of Rosario Laurella.
[4]
 Rex Bergante testified that on that
fateful day, he met Salvador Mijares on his way to Bato.  When they were already there, they heard a
gunshot and saw Donato Genanda, Sr., lying flat on the ground.
[5]


The appellants
also presented other witnesses.  One
Rosario Laurella corroborated the testimony of Leo Bergante.
[6]
 Remedios Lagan sought to discredit
the testimony of Renato Estrella by testifying that Renato were actually in
Poblacion Taytay and not in Barangay Bato in the afternoon of 14 February 1986
because they were together in a pumpboat headed from Barangay Bato to Taytay in
the morning of that day and went back to Bato the following day only.
[7]
 Filomeno Sunga sought to discredit
Faderangaâs claim of witnessing the incident by testifying that in the
afternoon of 14 February 1986, he was on board a jeep going to Liminangcong and
saw Ildefonso Faderanga on board another jeep bound for Roxas.  However, upon interrogation by the court, as
well as on cross-examination, he declared that it was about 7:00 a.m. while the
jeep was in Barangay Bato when he saw Faderanga.  On redirect examination, he opined that Roxas was about three
hours travel from Barangay Bato.
[8]


On the strength
of the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution and of the victimâs
dying declaration, the trial court, in its decision of 26 December 1994,
[9]
 convicted all the three appellants
of murder and sentenced them to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua

and to pay the heirs of the victim in the sum of 
P
80,000 as actual
damages and 
P
100,000 as moral and exemplary damages, plus costs.  It also convicted appellant Rex Bergante of
illegal possession of firearms and sentenced him to suffer 18 years of
imprisonment.  The trial court
ratiocinated in this manner: 


There is no doubt that Donato
Genanda, Sr. sustained wounds on that day which included a gunshot wound in the
abdominal area, abrasions on the forehead and outer angle of his left eye, and
a ruptured left eyeball (Autopsy Report, Exh. âIâ; and Certificate of Death
with certification, Exh. âHâ).  Eyewitnesses have positively identified Rex, Rodito and Leo Bergante as
the persons who attacked the victim on that afternoon.  Witnesses saw Rex shoot the victim on the
abdominal area, Rodito hit him on the head with a mangrove branch, and Leo
pierced his left eye with his bolo.  These acts attributed to the accused are consistent with the wounds
sustained by the victim.  True, accused
have presented their own alibis, supported by testimonies of their own
witnesses.  However, aside from the fact
that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses positively identifying
accused are clear, convincing and consistent, the alibi evidence of accused is
overcome by 
ante-mortem 
statement of the victim which categorically
identified the accused as the perpetrators of the crime.  Donato Genanda Jr. and Rodolfo Gallego have
testified that the old man repeatedly stated that it was Rex Bergante who had
shot him, Rodito who had mauled him and Leo who had pierced his eye, up to the
time when he was in the hospital where he expired the next day.


âBare denial of guilt is
insufficient to overcome positive testimony on the culpability of the accused.â
(People vs. De Guzman, 194 SCRA 618).


âGreater weight is given to the
positive testimony of prosecution witnesses than to accused-appellantâs
denial.â (People vs. Alerta, Jr., 198 SCRA 656).


âThe defense of alibi cannot
overcome the dying declaration of the victim and the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses.â (People vs. Clamor, 198 SCRA 642).


The statement of the victim as to
the acts perpetrated by accused qualify as dying declarations since it
concern[ed] the cause and surrounding circumstances of the declarantâs death;
at the time the declaration was made, the extent of his wounds manifested a
consciousness of his impending death; he [was] competent as a witness; and the
declaration [was] offered in a criminal case in which the killing is qualified
to murder (Article 248, Revised Penal Code).  Treachery was manifested by the fact that the three accused, acting in
concert, waylaid the victim and suddenly and simultaneously attacked him, all
using weapons, while the victim was alone and defenseless.  Moments before the attack, accused Rodito
Bergante had conversed with the victim as if the attack was farthest from his
mind.


As to the charge of illegal
possession of firearms, the court finds that only Rex Bergante has been shown
to be in possession of the shot gun without license or authority to possess
firearms.  The gun was recovered only
from him.  At the time of his arrest, he
was not in the company of his brothers.  There is no showing that Leo and Rodito Bergante had any unlicensed
firearms in their possession to make them similarly culpable for violation of
P.D. No. 1866.


The appellants
seasonably interposed this appeal from the judgment of conviction.  They urge us to acquit them because the
lower court erred (a) in not finding that there existed no conspiracy and (b)
in considering the statement of the victim as dying declaration.  


In their
argument in support thereof, the appellants assail the admission by the trial
court of the dying declaration of the victim as testified to by Donato Genanda,
Jr.  They claim that the dying
declaration was âmade under the suggestion of improper influence,â was
impressed with ill-motive on the decedentâs part, and did not overcome the
required burden of proof. 


We
disagree.  The essential requisites for
the admission of a dying declaration under Section 37 of Rule 130 of the Rules
of Court are as follows:  


(a)  The
declaration must concern the cause and surrounding circumstances of the
declarantâs death;


(b)  At the
time the declaration was made, the declarant was under the consciousness of an
impending death;


(c)  The declarant is competent as a witness; and


(d)  The
declaration is offered in a criminal case for homicide, murder, or parricide in
which the declarant is a victim.
[10]


The trial court
correctly held the dying declaration of Donato Genanda, Sr., as admissible. The
declaration pointed to the manner the declarant was attacked, which undoubtedly
referred to the first requisite.  There
can as well be no doubt that Donato was under the consciousness of death by
reason of the gravity of the injuries he sustained, which caused his death some
hours later.  That Donato was a
competent witness was best shown by his conduct before the incident and after
he was attacked.  No evidence was
submitted that he was incompetent to act as a witness.  Finally, Donatoâs declaration was offered in
a case for murder in which he was the victim.  


In any event,
the declaration of Donato Genanda, Sr., may also be admitted as part of the 
res
gestae
 under Section 42 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court.  Furthermore, even if such declaration be
disregarded, the testimonies of eyewitnesses Renato Estrella and Ildefonso
Faderanga established beyond doubt that Rex Bergante shot Donato with a
firearm, that Rodito Bergante clubbed the latter with a piece of mangrove, and
that Leo Bergante pierced the victimâs eye with the tip of a bolo.  The following is the testimony on direct
examination of Renato Estrella:  


ATTY. MARCAIDA:


(to witness)


Q
     
While
you were hiding in the bushes at the corner of the house of Jesus Genanga, what
if any did happen?


A
     
I
saw that the three simultaneously attacked the old man, and this Rex Bergante
shot the old man.


Q
     
Who
is this old man that you are referring to?


A
     
Donato
Genanda, Sr.,  Sir.


Q
     
And
what happened when Rex Bergante shot Donato Genanda, Sr.?


A
     
Donato
Genanda Sr. fell from the carabao where he was riding.


Q
     
What
happened when he fell from the carabao?


A
     
When
Donato Genanda Sr. fell from the carabao, Rodito Bergante got a piece of
âbakawanâ and hit him and clubbed him on the head.


Q
     
And
was the old man hit when he was clubbed by Rodito Bergante with that piece of
bakawan?


A
     
Yes,
Sir. 


Q
     
How
many times was he hit by that bakawan?


A
     
Only
once, Sir.


Q
     
Where
was he hit?


A
     
(as
witness pointed the left side of the forehead)


Q
     
And
how about this Leo Bergante and Rex Bergante, where were they at that time?


A
     
Leo
got the bolo of the old man and (
tinusok
) pinch[ed] the eyes of the old
man, Sir.


Q
     
Was
the old man hit in the eye?


A
     
Yes,
Sir.


Q
     
How
many times was the old man hit at the eye?


A
     
Only
once, Sir.


COURT:


Which eye, the left or right?


A
     
Left
eye your Honor.


ATTY. MARCAIDA:


(to witness)


Q
     
What
part of the bolo hit the eye of the old man?


A
     
The
tip of the bolo, Sir.


Q
     
Was
that bolo pointed?


A
     
Yes,
Sir.
[11]


Ildefonso
Faderanga also testified on direct examination as follows:


ATTY. MARCAIDA:


Q
     
Going
back to the incident you see [
sic
] regarding the killing of Donato
Genanda, Sr., do you know the participation of each of the accused?


A
     
Yes,
Sir.


Q
     
Will
you please tell the Court the participation of each of the accused?


A
     
As
far as I witnessed Rodito Bergante was holding a 
bakawan
, Leo Bergante
was holding a bolo and Rex Bergante was holding a short, I think as I saw it
was a gun.


Q
     
And
do you know, on the basis [of what] you have seen, what Rodito Bergante did to
this piece of wood he was holding?


A
     
He
was the one who hit the old man.


Q
     
Who
is this old man?


A
     
Donato
Genanda, Sr., Sir.


Q
     
About
this Leo Bergante, what was his participation?


A
     
He
was the one who stabbed the old man.


Q
     
And
do you know where the old man was hit?


A
     
Yes,
Sir.


Q
     
Where
was the old man Donato Genanda hit?


A 
    
Near
the eye, Sir.


Q
     
And
how about this Rex Bergante, do you know what he did to the gun he was holding?


A
     
Yes,
Sir.


Q
     
What
did he do to that firearm?


A
     
He
was the one who shot Donato Genanda, Sr.
[12]


The appellants
likewise question the credibility of Renato Estrella in that if he were really
near the scene of the crime he would not have let the victim proceed; or he
would have helped the latter or, at least,  called for help.  Furthermore,
the testimony of Remedios Lagan placed Renato in Taytay, Palawan, approximately
100 kilometers from the crime scene.


We agree with
the Solicitor General that Renato Estrellaâs testimony is credible even if he
failed to react in the way the appellants claim to be normal given the
situation.  Renatoâs explanation that he
was afraid that he would suffer the same fate as Donato Genanda, Sr.,
sufficiently clears his testimony.  Moreover, we have held that not every witness to a crime can be expected
to act reasonably and conformably to the expectation of mankind.  Human nature teaches us that people may
react differently to the same situation.  One personâs spontaneous or unthinking or even instinctive response to a
horrid and repulsive stimulus may be aggression, while anotherâs may be cold
indifference.
[13]


The testimony of
Remedios Lagan placing Renato Estrella somewhere else and not near the scene of
the crime at the time of its commission is unconvincing. Moreover, Renatoâs
presence in Barangay Bato was confirmed no less by the testimony of Donato
Genanda, Jr., that it was Renato who first notified him of his fatherâs
predicament.  If Renato were not at the
scene of the crime, he would not have rushed himself to notify Donato Genanda,
Jr., of  the incident.


Anent the
testimony of Filomeno Sunga, the same did not categorically establish that
prosecution witness Ildefonso Faderanga was not in Bato when the incident in
question occurred.


At any rate, no
ill-motive was shown to discredit Renato Estrella and Ildefonso Faderanga.  It is well-settled that where there is
nothing to indicate that the principal witnesses for the prosecution were
actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that they were not so actuated
and their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credit.
[14]


Appellantsâ
claim that Donato Genanda, Sr., could have been shot by another person from
atop a carabao considering the downward position of the bullet hardly
persuades.  It  was proved with moral certainty that Rex Bergante shot the victim
and that the latter sustained a gunshot wound.


The proffered
alibi of the appellants cannot stand scrutiny against their positive
identification by the victim himself as well as by the witnesses for the
prosecution. 


The existence of
conspiracy is undeniable.  By the
successive acts of shooting by Rex, clubbing by Rodito, and piercing of the
victimâs eye by Leo, all of the appellants are deemed to have agreed to commit
the crime of murder.  Each of their
contributory acts without any semblance of desistance reflected their
resolution to commit the said crime.
[15]
 From a legal standpoint, there is
conspiracy if at the time of the commission of the offense the appellants had
the same purpose and were united in its execution.
[16]
 Direct proof of previous agreement
to commit a crime is not necessary.  Conspiracy may be deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense
was perpetrated, or inferred from the acts of the appellants themselves when
such acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action, and community
of intent.
[17]
 Where conspiracy is established,
the act of one is the act of all.
[18]


The generic
aggravating circumstances of (1) disregard of the respect due the offended
party on account of age, and (2) cruelty
[19]
 attended the commission of the
crime.  The offended party was nearly
seventy-one years old at the time he was killed, while the appellants were in
their twenties.
[20]
 Even after the victim was shot by
Rex and hit on the head with a piece of mangrove by Rodito, Leo pierced the
victimâs eye with a bolo.  The latter
injury was unnecessary and was inflicted to deliberately and inhumanly augment
the sufferings of the old man.  


The penalty for
murder at the time it was committed was 
reclusion temporal 
maximum to
death under Article 248
[21]
 of the Revised Penal Code.  With the two generic aggravating
circumstances, the imposable penalty should have been death pursuant to Article
64 of the Revised Penal Code.  In view,
however, of the constitutional ban against death penalty under Section 19(1),
Article III of the Constitution, only the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua

may be imposed.


As to the case
of illegal possession of firearms against appellant Rex Bergante, the trial
court correctly found him guilty thereof.  The essential requisites for the commission of such crime are (1) the
existence of the subject firearm and (2) the fact that the accused who owned or
possessed the firearm does not have the license to possess the same.  The  caliber .32 gun with serial number 497826 (Exh. âBâ) used by Rex in
shooting Donato Genanda, Sr., was surrendered by him to the Philippine
Constabulary and was duly received.
[22]
 It was established that Rex was not
licensed to carry a firearm
[23]
 and that the firearm used by him was
unlicensed.  A violation of P.D. No.
1866 was thus established beyond doubt.  


The violation of
P.D. No. 1866 should have been punished separately conformably with our ruling
in 
People v. Quijada.
[24]
 Nevertheless, fortunately for
appellant Rex Bergante, P.D. No. 1866 was recently amended by Republic Act No.
8294, otherwise known as âAn Act Amending the Provisions of Presidential Decree
No. 1866, as Amended.â  The third
paragraph of Section 1 of said Act provides that âif homicide or murder is
committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed
firearm shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance.â  In short, only one offense should be
punished, 
viz
., either homicide or murder, and the use of the unlicensed
firearm should only be considered as an aggravating circumstance.  Being favorable to Rex Bergante, this
provision may be given retroactive effect pursuant to Article 22 of the Revised
Penal Code, he not being a habitual criminal.  


The aggravating circumstance
of âuse of an unlicensed firearmâ shall then be appreciated against Rex
Bergante which, by itself, warrants the imposition of death penalty pursuant to
Article 64(3) of the Revised Penal Code.  However, in view of the aforementioned constitutional prohibition under
Section 19(1) of Article III of the Constitution, only the penalty of r
eclusion
perpetua
 may be imposed.  In point
of law then, three generic aggravating circumstances should be appreciated
against appellant Rex Bergante. 


And now on the
award of damages.  In Criminal Case No.
86-6371 the trial court ordered the appellants to pay the heirs of the late
Donato Genanda, Sr., in the amount of 
P
80,000 as actual damages  and 
P
100,000 as moral and exemplary
damages.  These awards stand modification.  The victimâs widow, Leonora Genanda,
declared that she spent more or less 
P
12,000 for the wake; 
P
16,000
for âtransporting the bodyâ; 
P
24,000 for fares in going to and from the
court for the hearing of the cases; 
P
20,000 for attorneyâs fees; 
P
2,000
for her lawyerâs travel expenses; and 
P
8,000 for her lawyerâs appearance
fees.  The aggregate of these is 
P
82,000.  The recovery of attorneyâs fees in the
concept of actual or compensatory damage is allowed under the circumstances
provided for in Article 2208 of the Civil Code, one of which is when the court
deems it just and equitable that attorneyâs fees and expenses of litigation
should be recovered.  The award should,
therefore, be increased to 
P
82,000. 


The trial court
should have specified how much of the 
P
100,000 was for moral damages and
how much was for exemplary damages.  These damages are distinct from each other.  Moral damages are governed by Articles 2217 to 2220, inclusive,
of the Civil Code; while exemplary damages are governed by Articles 2229 to
2235 thereof.


Moral damages
include physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched
reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar
injury.  Under Article 2206(3) the
spouse, and the legitimate and illegitimate descendants and ascendants of the
deceased may demand moral damages for mental anguish by reason of the death of
the deceased resulting from a crime. 


In the instant
case, Leonora Genanda, then 70 years old when she testified,
[25]
 declared that because of her
husbandâs death, she âsuffered very much,â had sleepless nights, and could not
eat.  The victimâs son, Donato Genanda,
Jr., did not testify on the moral damages he might have suffered.  Hence, only the victimâs widow may be
entitled to moral damages, and an award of 
P
25,000 would be adequate.


As to exemplary
damages, the same may be granted in criminal cases as part of the civil
liability if the crime was committed with one or more aggravating
circumstances.  As stated earlier, more
than one generic aggravating circumstance attended the killing of Donato
Genanda, Sr.  An award of 
P
25,000
as exemplary damages in favor of the heirs of the victim is in order.


The trial court
erred in not awarding in favor of the victimâs heirs civil indemnity under
Article 2206 of the Civil Code, which current jurisprudence has fixed at 
P
50,000.


IN VIEW
WHEREOF
, the
assailed decision of Branch 49 of the Regional Trial Court of Palawan in
Criminal Case No. 86-6371 convicting REX BERGANTE, RODITO BERGANTE, and LEO BERGANTE

25,000
as exemplary damages; and (2) Leonora Genanda, in the sum of 
P
25,000 as
