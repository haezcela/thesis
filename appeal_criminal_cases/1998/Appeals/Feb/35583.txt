PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES,
PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ALBERTO MEDINA Y CATUD,
ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


The law presumes
that an offender possesses full control of his mental faculties.  Thus, the exempting circumstance of insanity
or imbecility under Art. 12, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code must be
established by clear and competent evidence showing that the accused completely
lost his reason, or was demented immediately prior to or at the very moment the
crime was committed.


The Case


This is the
legal precept relied upon by this Court in denying this appeal from the
Decision
[1]
 dated November 17, 1993 of the
Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 7, in Criminal Case No. 5787
convicting Alberto Medina 
y
 Catud of murder.


In an
Information dated June 10, 1992, Second Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Benito
E. Lat charged appellant with murder allegedly committed as follows:
[2]


âThat on or about the 20th day of
May, 1992, at about 11:00 oâclock in the evening, in Barangay Kaingin,
Municipality of San Pascual, Province of Batangas, Philippines and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a
balisong knife, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation
and without any justifiable cause, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously attack, assault and stab with the said balisong knife one Andres M.
Dalisay, suddenly and without warning, thereby inflicting upon the latter stab wounds
on the different parts of his body, which directly caused his death.


Contrary to law.â


On arraignment,
appellant, assisted by Counsel Jose Contreras, pleaded ânot guiltyâ to the
charge.
[3]
 After trial in due course, the
court 
a quo
 rendered the assailed Decision, the decretal portion of
which reads:
[4]


âWHEREFORE, the court finds the
accused, ALBERTO MEDINA y CATUD, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
murder as defined and penalized by Article 248 of the Revised Penal [Code] and
there being no mitigating circumstance to offset the qualifying circumstance of
treachery and generic aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, and
hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to
pay the heirs of the deceased Andres M. Dalisay the sum of 
P
50,000.00.  Costs against the deceased.â


Hence, this
appeal.
[5]


The Facts


Version of the Prosecution


The
prosecutionâs version of the facts, as recounted by the solicitor general in
the appelleeâs brief, is as follows:
[6]


âAt around 11 pm on May 20, 1991, a
party was held in the house of Sebastian and Delia Aguila in Barangay Caingin,
Balite, Batangas, to celebrate the awarding of a championship trophy to the
basketball team of Larry Andal.  Among
those present during the celebration were Andres Dalisay, Edgardo Silang, Larry
Andal, Norberto Biscocho, Bayani Dorado, Salustiano Aguila and appellant
Alberto Medina (pp. 3-5, tsn, September 9, 1992, testimony of Larry
Andal).  During the celebration, appellant
and Dalisay danced the âcha-chaâ in the shade (sulambi) near the terrace of the
house of Delia and Sebastian Aguila.  While the two were dancing, the group watched and clapped their
hands.  When the dance was finished,
appellant left the house of the Aguilas.  After a while, Dalisay invited Andal to go home (pp. 8-11, tsn,
September 11, 1992).  The two left the
house of the Aguilas, with Dalisay walking ahead of Andal.  While they were walking, Andal saw
appellant, who was waiting along the way, stab Dalisay with a âbalisongâ in the
abdominal region.  Dalisay held the hand
of appellant.  While they were
grappling, Dalisay was able to extricate himself and started to run away.  Appellant chased him.  When appellant caught up with Dalisay,
appellant stabbed Dalisay once more at the back.  Dalisay fell to the ground.  He tried to get up and run, but he again fell down.  Appellant stabbed him [once more] on the
chest.  Then [a]ppellant fled from the
scene.


Andal, who was about one meter
away, was so stunned and shocked by what he saw that he did not do anything to
help Dalisay.  Andal and his relatives
brought Dalisay to the Batangas Regional Hospital, but Dalisay was pronounced
dead on arrival (pp. 2-6, tsn, Sept. 11, 1992).


At that time of the incident,
prosecution witness Edgardo Silang was urinating twenty paces away.  He heard Delia Aguila, the sister of
appellant, shouting, âHusay ka Alberto pihadong makukulong ka, sinaksak mo si
Andres.â  When he turned to where the
shout came from, he saw Dalisay running towards him, pursued by appellant.  He saw blood in front of the body of
Dalisay.  He held the arm of Dalisay and
tried to hug him but Dalisay fell to the ground.  At that point, he saw appellant flee (pp. 5-18, tsn, Sept. 9,
1992, testimony of Edgardo Silang).


Dr. Benjamin M. Aguado, the Municipal
Health Officer of San Pascual Rural Health Unit, conducted a post-mortem
examination of the body of the deceased.  He issued a Post-Mortem Examination Report (Exhibit âCâ) containing the
following findings:


â1.
      
Stab Wound between the 3rd
& 4th interspace at the lateral side of the body of the sternum measuring Â½
inch in length x 2 cm in wid[th] x 3 cm in depth.

(Exhibit

Version of the Defense


In his brief,
appellant sets up insanity as his defense.  His version of the facts is as follows:
[7]


â1.
      
Accused-appellant

Alberto Medina 
testified that on the evening of May 20, 1992, he went to
the house of his sister, Delia Aguila, purposely to watch t.v. (TSN, September
9, 1993, p. 5).  Upon his arrival, he
saw the group of the deceased Andres Dalisay, Larry Andal and Edgardo Silang
who were then engaged in a drinking spree at the balcony of the Aguila
residence (Ibid, p. 6).


2.
       
Accused-appellant
refused the groupâs invitation to join them in their drinking; however, he
accepted their invitation to dance with Andres Dalisay (Ibid.).  In fact, accused-appellant danced with him
for about six (6) or seven (7) times (Ibid, p. 7).


3.
       
As
the dance and the party ended, the guests started to leave.  Accused-appellant left his sisterâs house to
head for his home at Barangay Balete, which was more or less 200 meters
away.  Among the persons left behind was
Andres Dalisay.


4.
       
While
walking along the path, accused-appellant heard Andres Dalisay say, âBert,
sandali langâ, (TSN, September 9, 1993, p. 10) prompting the former to stop.


5.
       
Thereupon,
Andres Dalisay, who appeared to be drunk, approached accused-appellant and
uttered: âBakit mo ako hiniya?â and hit him (accused-appellant) on the chest
(Ibid).  Enraged, accused-appellant
prepared to fight back when Andres Dalisay threatened to kill him (Ibid., p.
11).  At this point, accused-appellant
further testified, it looked as if Andres Dalisay was taking something out [of]
his pocket.


6.
       
Upon
seeing this, accused-appellant beat him to the draw, took out his âbalisongâ
and stabbed Andres Dalisay, who then looked like a devil with âhornsâ (Ibid.,
p. 11 and 19).  It was only when Andres
Dalisay uttered âMay tama akoâ did accused-appellant stop xxx stabbing his
victim (Ibid., p. 16).


7.
       
Upon
realizing that he has stabbed a person, accused-appellant surrendered himself
and the weapon on the same evening to the authorities (TSN, September 9, 1993,
p. 20).


8.
       
On
several occasions before, specifically during the latter part of 1981,
accused-appellant had exhibited unusual behaviors.  His sister 
Lorna Medina 
testified that on June 22, 1982,
she brought her brother to the National Mental Hospital after the latter had
shown unusual conduct, such as looking blankly at a distance, hitting his wife
or banging her head on the wall for no reason and having sleepless nights (TSN,
August 11, 1993, pp. 13-15).


9.
       
From
June to October of 1982, accused-appellant was confined at the National Mental
Hospital.  
Ms. Lourdes Palapal
,
the Records Officer of the National Center for Mental Health (formerly, the
National Mental Hospital) testified on the documents issued by their office
relative to the confinement of accused-appellant for âschizophreniform disorderâ
during that period (Exhibits 3 to 11).


10.
     
After
his release from the hospital, accused-appellant lived with his mother and his
two children at Brgy. Balete, San Pascual, Batangas.  His condition did not seem to improve, though.  Lorna Medina further testified that in
January of 1992, accused-appellant again exhibited the same unusual behavior
which she had observed from him in 1982 (TSN, August 11, 1993, p.17).


11.
     
This
prompted Lorna to refer her brotherâs case to Dr. Teresita Adigue, a
psychologist-friend who conducted a psychological examination on
accused-appellant (TSN, August 11, 1993, p. 17).


12.
     
Dr.
Teresita Adigue, a Doctor of Psychology and a holder of a Masterâs Degree in
Clinical and Industrial Psychology and another Masterâs Degree in Guidance and
Counselling, and an accredited psychologist of the Philippine National Police
testified that on January 20, 1992, she administered a psychological evaluation
on accused-appellant (TSN, May 24, 1993, p. 5).


13.
     
Dr.
Adigue testified that based on the evaluation of accused-appellant, the latter
has been shown to be suffering from depression and was exhibiting homicidal
tendencies, and that he did not know the difference between right and wrong
(TSN, May 24, 1993, p. 10 and TSN, July 20, 1993, p. 16).  On cross-examination, the witness affirmed
that a person suffering from depression may be insane (TSN, July 20, 1993, p.
10).


14.
     
Dr.
Adigue stated that the psychological evaluation made on accused-appellant was
based on the behavioral history of the latter furnished to her by Lorna Medina
and Leticia Regalado, (TSN, July 20, 1993, p. 11) a case study based on the
family background of accused-appellant (Ibid., p. 12), and on a series of
psychological tests (âdraw a personâ test, the âcardâ test wherein the emotions
of the subject are represented by the cards, and the thematic perception test)
(TSN, May 24, 1993, p. 7).â


Ruling of the Trial Court


The trial court
rejected the appellantâs defense of insanity.  It ruled that Dr. Adigue was not properly qualified as an expert witness
because: (1) she did not have the appellantâs complete behavioral history; (2)
she failed to demonstrate satisfactorily how she  arrived at  her conclusions;
(3) her method of testing was incomplete and inconclusive; (4) her examination
lasted for only a few hours without any follow-up evaluation; (5) the
university from where she allegedly obtained her doctoral degree is not known
to specialize in psychology or psychiatry; (6) she is not known as a
psychiatrist; and (7) she reported that âthe mental activity [of the accused
was] functioning on the normal levelâ at the time of the evaluation, that he
comprehended instructions fast, and that he was suffering only from mild
depression.


The testimony of
appellantâs sister that she had observed unusual behavior on the part of
appellant did not constitute sufficient proof of his insanity, âbecause not
every aberration of the mind or mental deficiency constitute[s] insanity.â That
the accused was released from confinement at the National Center for Mental
Health on October 4, 1982 and was not readmitted for any mental disorder for
about ten years militated against his alleged lunacy.  Additionally, the trial judge observed that, during the hearings,
appellant was attentive, well-behaved and responsive to the questions
propounded to him in English even without translation.


On the other
hand, appellantâs mental agility was shown when he admitted seeing the deceased
take something out of his pocket, for which reason he decided to beat him to
the draw (â
Inunahan ko na
â).  With his 
balisong
, he repeatedly stabbed the deceased.  The trial court appreciated treachery based
on Andalâs narration of the stabbing incident.


Assignment of Errors


The defense
assigns the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court in
convicting appellant:


âA


The trial court gravely erred in
not acquitting accused-appellant or mitigating his criminal liability on the
ground of insanity.


B


Assuming, 
arguendo
, that accused-appellant
is criminally liable for the death of Andres Dalisay, the trial court
nevertheless erred in convicting him of the crime of murder by appreciating the
aggravating circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation despite doubt
tending to show the existence of such circumstances.


C


Assuming, 
arguendo
, that
accused-appellant is criminally liable, the trial court likewise erred in not
appreciating the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender in his favor.â


In short,
appellant puts in issue (1) his insanity and (2) the presence and the effect of
the following circumstances: (a) treachery, (b) evident premeditation, and (c)
voluntary surrender.  We shall deal with
each of these issues.


The Courtâs Ruling


The appeal is
partly meritorious.  We reject
appellantâs plea for acquittal but accept his claim of voluntary surrender.


First Issue: 
Appellantâs Insanity Not Proven


Appellant
insists that the trial court gravely erred in refusing to consider Dr. Adigue
as an expert witness.  He argues that
Dr. Adigue, being an accredited psychologist of the Philippine National Police
since 1979 and a holder of a doctorate in psychology from the University of
Calcutta, India, and a masterâs degree in clinical and industrial psychology,
deserves credence.


Appellant misses
the point.  More than her academic
qualifications as a psychologist, what really matters is the failure of Dr.
Adigueâs testimony to establish legal insanity on the part of the appellant.  After examining the appellant on January 20,
1992, or four months prior to the incident, and after conducting the
âDraw-a-Personâ Test, the Thematic Apperception Test and the Hand Test, she
reported the results of her examination as follows:


âVII.
    
TEST RESULTS/EVALUATIONS


Psychological test results revealed
that subjectâs mental activity is functioning on the normal level at the time
of evaluation.  He can comprehend
instructions fast and [was] never hesitant to take the said examinations.


With regards to some dominant
personality factors, test results revealed also the fact that subject is
suffering 
only 
from mild depression because of problems he had
encountered in life and in things around him.  He had also developed negative reactions and outlook in life, therefore
the undersigned concluded that he has some emotional disturbances.â


Verily, such
results do not prove the alleged insanity of the appellant.  Art. 12, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code,
requires a complete deprivation of rationality in committing the act; 
i.e.,
  that the accused be deprived of reason, that
there be no consciousness of responsibility for his acts, or that there be
complete absence of the power to discern.
[8]
 More relevantly, said report does
not support the claim that appellant could not distinguish right from wrong.


Thus, the trial
court properly rejected appellantâs defense of insanity.  The presumption of law, per Art. 800 of the
Civil Code, always lies in favor of sanity, and, in the absence of proof to the
contrary, every person is presumed to be of sound mind.
[9]


The defense of insanity
or imbecility must be clearly proved,
[10]
 for there is a presumption that
acts penalized by law are voluntary.
[11]
 Hence, in the absence of positive
evidence that the accused had previously lost his reason or was demented
moments prior to or during the perpetration of the crime, the courts will
always presume that he was in a normal state of mind.  In 
Bascos,
[12]
 
the accused was exempted from criminal liability
because he was a violent maniac as confirmed by the acting district health
officer who examined him.  In
 Bonoan,
[13]
 
the Court reversed the conviction of the accused,
holding that a person afflicted with 
dementia praecox 
and 
manic
depressive psychosis
 has âno control whatever of his acts.  xxx  There is in this disorder a pathologic lessening [of] normal inhibitions
and the case [in] which impulses may lead to actions impairs deliberations and
the use of normal checks to motor impulses  (Peterson, Haines and Webster, Legal Medicine and Toxicology [2d ed.,
1926], vol. I, p. 617).â  There, the
accused was treated at the psychiatric department of San Lazaro Hospital and
was released long before the commission of the crime, but the reports of the
alienists
[14]
 who examined the accused after the
crime confirmed his mental disorders.  The Court held that the evidence that the accused appeared lucid when he
stabbed the victim did not necessarily prove his sanity, because it was âclear
from what Dr. Sydney Smith, Regius Professor of Forensic Medicine, University
of Edinburgh, said in his work on Forensic Medicine, (3d. ed. [London], p.
382), that in the type of 
dementia praecox,
 âthe crime is usually
preceded by much 
complaining and planning
.  In these people, homicidal attacks are common, because of
delusions that they are being interfered with sexually 
or that their
property is being taken
.ââ
[15]


However, care
must be taken to distinguish between lack of reason (insanity) and failure to
use reason or good judgment due to extreme anger (passion).  âxxx [I]t is now well settled that mere
mental depravity, or moral insanity, so called, which results, not from any
disease of mind, but from a perverted condition of the moral system, where the
person is mentally sane, does not exempt one from responsibility for crimes
committed under its influence.â
[16]


Thus, before the
defense of insanity may be accepted as an exempting circumstance, Philippine
case law shows a common reliance on the test of cognition, which requires a
complete deprivation of intelligence -- not only of the will -- in committing
the criminal act.
[17]
 In the cited case of 
Rafanan, 
the
fact that appellant threatened the victim with death in case she reported her
ravishment indicated that he was aware of the reprehensible moral depravity of
that assault and that he was not deprived of intelligence.  In 
Dungo, 
that the accused knew the
nature of what he had done negated his claim that he was insane when he fatally
stabbed his victim.
[18]
 In 
Aquino
[19]
, 
appellant, who took 120 cc of cough syrup and
consumed three sticks of marijuana before raping his victim and hitting her
head with a stone, had some form of mental illness which did not totally
deprive him of intelligence.  The
presence of his reasoning faculties, enabling him to exercise sound judgment
and to satisfactorily articulate the aforesaid matters, sufficiently discounted
any intimation of insanity when he committed the felony.  It has been held that mere abnormality of
the mental faculties does not exclude criminal culpability.


In the present
case, Dr. Adigueâs testimony did not establish complete  deprivation  of  appellantâs  reason.  Consequently, appellant cannot claim exemption from criminal liability
under Art. 12, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code.


Alternatively,
appellant argues that his condition should merit, at the very least, the
appreciation of a mitigating circumstance under Art. 13, par. 9 of the Code.
[20]
 In 
Formigones,
 the Court
found the feeblemindedness of the accused to be a mitigating circumstance,
noting that his faculties were not fully developed.  After stabbing his wife, the accused in said case took her dead
body up their house, put her on the floor and lay beside her for hours, showing
remorse at having killed her.  The
accused was ââsuffering [from] some physical defect which thus restrict[ed] his
means of action, defense or communication with his fellow beings,â or such
illness âas would diminish the exercise of his will power.ââ
[21]
 In 
Rafanan, 
schizophrenic
reaction, although not exempting because it does not completely deprive the
offender of the consciousness of his acts, was considered a mitigating
circumstance which diminished the exercise of the offenderâs will power
without, however, depriving  him of the
consciousness of his acts.
[22]


In the instant
case, however, the defense miserably failed to establish the deprivation of the
appellantâs will when he stabbed his victim.  Appellant testified that he thought the victim was going to pull out a
weapon, thus he beat him to the draw and stabbed him with his 
balisong.
[23]
 
This statement shows that he did not suffer any
deprivation of reason or discernment.  While the victim appeared to him as a âdevil with horns,â such
perceptual distortion occurred only after he had dealt the fatal blows on the
victim.  The Court cannot, therefore,
appreciate this mitigating circumstance in his favor.


Second Issue:
  Proof of Treachery


The treacherous
nature of appellantâs attack on the victim was established by Andal who
witnessed the incident.  Testified the
witness:
[24]


âFISCAL CARAAN:

A
     
After
the stabbing of Andres at the back by Alberto, Andres was able to get up and
ran and while running he fell for the second time and Alberto stabbed [him]
again on the chest, sir.â


Treachery can be
gleaned from the fact that appellant waited behind a chico tree and then, all
of a sudden, jumped on the victim.  Appellantâs attack was not only sudden and unexpected; it was also
vicious and relentless.  After
delivering the first stab, appellant chased his victim and stabbed him seven
more times.  These seven additional
stabs were inflicted when the victim was helpless, as he fell down several
times during the pursuit.  Counterattack
and escape proved futile because of the injuries that the victim sustained.  The medico-legal officer reported that of
the eight stab wounds on the victim, six were fatal.
[25]
 Clearly, in killing his victim,
appellant employed means which ensured its execution without risk to himself
arising from any defense which the victim might make.
[26]
 Treachery which qualified the
killing as murder was properly appreciated by the trial court.


Third Issue:
  Absence of Evident Premeditation


The Court
concurs with appellant and the solicitor general that the trial court erred in
appreciating evident premeditation.  The
solicitor general explains that âonly a few minutes had passedâ from the time
appellant left his sisterâs house to the time he stabbed his victim.  Thus, no sufficient lapse of time is
appreciable from the determination to commit the crime until its execution to
allow appellant to reflect upon the consequences of his act.
[27]
 Under such circumstances, evident
premeditation cannot be appreciated.


Fourth Issue:
  Voluntary Surrender


The mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender should have been credited in favor of the
appellant.
[28]
 The solicitor general concurs and
notes that appellant, after having earlier given himself up to a certain Col.
Faltado, surrendered at midnight on May 20, 1992, or about an hour after the
stabbing incident, to Wilfredo Sevillano, former desk officer of the Batangas
City Police Station.
[29]
 Hence, the evidence sufficiently
established the elements of voluntary surrender, namely: (1) the offender has
not been actually arrested; (2) he surrendered himself to a person in authority
or an agent of a person in authority; and (3) his surrender was voluntary.
[30]


The Proper Penalty


Voluntary
surrender diminishes appellantâs penalty.  Since the crime was committed prior to the effectivity of Republic Act
7659,  the imposable penalty for murder
is 
reclusiÃ³n temporal
 in its maximum period to death.  The proscription of the death penalty by the
1987 Constitution did not amend the imposable penalty under said article.
[31]
 Thus, Art. 64, which provides the
rules for the application of penalties containing three periods, governs the
determination of the proper penalty in this particular case.
[32]
 Contrary to the contention of the
solicitor general, Art. 63 of the Revised Penal Code does not apply.
[33]


Following Art.
64 (2) of the Code, the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender entitles
appellant to the imposition of 
reclusiÃ³n temporal
 in its maximum
period.  Applying the Indeterminate
Sentence Law (Act No. 4103, as amended), appellant should be sentenced to an
indeterminate sentence of 
prision mayor
 in its maximum period, as
minimum, and 
reclusion temporal
 in its maximum period, as maximum.


WHEREFORE
, the appealed Decision is 
AFFIRMED


with 
MODIFICATION
.  
Appellant
is 
IMPOSED
 an indeterminate sentence of ten years and one day of 
prisiÃ³n
mayor
 maximum
, 
as minimum, and seventeen years, four months and one
day of 
reclusiÃ³n temporal
 maximum
, 
as maximum.


SO ORDERED.
