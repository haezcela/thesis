San Pablo, San Simon, Pampanga (pp. 7 - 8, TSN, June 10, 1987). He parked the jeepney in a "
talahiban
" where there were no people around except for the occupants of the passenger jeepney (pp. 7 - 8, TSN, June 10, 1986; pp. 7 - 8, TSN, March 10, 1987). Afterwards, appellant Rolando Rodriguez (Rodriguez) dragged Marilyn Martinez to the "
talahiban
" a few meters away from the parked jeepney where his three (3) companions, including appellant Pulusan, were left guarding Gomez and his other passengers (pp. 7-8, TSN, June 10, 1986; pp. 10-11, TSN March 10, 1987; pp. 1-13, TSN, March 18, 1987). Once at the "

Meanwhile, at the place where the jeepney was parked Gomez and one of his passengers who were then inside the vehicle were called outside by one of appellant's companions and asked Gomez " pare, gusto mo bang mamatay?" (p. 10, TSN, June 10, 1986). Gomez pleaded with them that he be spared because his wife recently gave birth and he was the only breadwinner for his family (

Thereafter, he was boxed at the right jaw and told to board the jeepney while said man, together with appellants Pulusan and Rodriguez, clubbed and stabbed the passenger who was called with him (pp. 10-11, TSN, June 10, 1986).

She next saw him later that evening at around 10:30 to eleven o'clock when he passed by Garcia's house where a bingo game was in progress.
[6]
 
When arrested at his house in Moras, Sto. Tomas, Pampanga, Rodriguez was with his two children, his uncle Eduardo Pulusan and 
jueteng
 collectors, one of which was Rolando Tayag, one of those charged with Pulusan and Rodriguez in the amended information. Pulusan was in Rodriguez's house to invite the latter to their town fiesta.
[7]
Eduardo Pulusan testifying in his defense asserted that on January 20, 1986, he was repairing his house in preparation for the coming fiesta. His helper then was a certain Tony. The following day, he also stayed at home because he helped his father in their fishpond. He did not leave his house until around 1:30 p.m. on January 23, 1986 when he went to the house of his nephew, Rolando Rodriguez, to invite him to the fiesta. Pulusan presented in court his mother, Agapita, and Antonio Libid, the carpenter who allegedly repaired his house, to corroborate his alibi. Both testified that Pulusan did not leave the house on the night of January 20, 1986.
[8]
He professed innocence because he had never been implicated in a crime, not even vagrancy. He denied the testimony of prosecution witness Sgt. Dulin that he once had a rape case against him.
[9]
 
On June 5, 1990, the Regional Trial Court of Bulucan, Branch 12 at Malolos, rendered a Decision in Criminal Case No. 9217-M as follows:

alias
 warrant of arrest be issued against accused Rolando Tayag.       
SO ORDERED.
[10]
 
Pulusan contends before this Court that the trial court erred in giving credence to his identification by prosecution witnesses as one of the perpetrators of the crime; in giving evidentiary weight to the "incredible, unreliable and inconsistent if not conflicting testimonies of the prosecution witnesses;" in failing to give "exculpatory weight" to his alibi which was supported by witnesses, and in convicting him even if his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.
[11]
 
Rodriguez asserts that the trial court erred in convicting him and imposing on him the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and in giving credence to the evidence presented by the prosecution.
[12]
 
The arguments of Pulusan and Rodriguez are anchored mainly on the issue of credibility. The matter of assigning values to declarations on the witness stand is best and most competently performed by the trial judge, who, unlike appellate magistrates, can weigh such testimony in the light of the declarant's demeanor, conduct and attitude at the trial and is hereby placed in a more competent position to discriminate between the true and the false.
[13]
 Thus, the trial court's findings on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to the highest degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal absent any clear showing that it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight or substance which could have affected the result of the case.
[14]
 There is no showing in the instant case of an oversight, misundertanding or misapplication of facts on the part of the trial court that may warrant reversal of that court" findings and conclusions.
 Pulusan avers that the prosecution witnesses' identification of him as one of the robbers was not enough to hurdle the test of certainty.
[15]
 Pulusan quotes the following portions of the testimony of Constancio Gomez:
[16]
 
                                                                                                                        
Q
Mr. Witness before the wheel of your jeep was taken from you and (you were) told to sit at the back, you did not recognize the faces of those persons? 
A
No, sir.
Q
Because you did not give a glance at their faces, correct? 
A 
When something was poked at me, I have not yet recognized them. 
But when I was sitted (sic) at the back, once in awhile I glanced at them, sir
. 
Q
Mr. Witness when one of the persons you mentioned who boarded your jeep at Tikay, Malolos, Bulacan poked a knife at your back and announced a hold-up, you became greatly afraid Mr. Witness, correct?
A 
Of course, sir. 
Q 
You were even terrified of being killed harmed by such happening, Mr. Witness?
A 
Yes, sir.
Q 
And you were very much afraid of these four men who announced the hold-up, correct? 
A 
Yes, sir, of course, I am afraid
  .                                                x x x                                             x x x                                     x x x  
                                                                                                                                                                                                
Q
In fact Mr. Witness when these persons announced the hold-up, specifically when one of them was poking a knife at your back and you were terribly afraid of these four persons, you were afraid much more to look at their faces, correct?
A
Yes, sir, I am not looking at their faces because something was poked at me
Q
Now even if you were ordered to go inside the jeepney, together with the passengers and even after one of the four men took the wheels of the jeep, you were still very afraid to look at them, correct? 
A 
Even if I am so afraid, sir, once in a while I glanced at them and tried to recognize them.
 
Q
Is it not a fact Mr. Witness that when you were ordered to go inside the jeep to sit with your passengers, they ordered the light of the jeep to be put off?
A 
When that was said, we were already far and all the valuables were already taken from us, sir. 
Q 
The light were (sic) ordered to go inside the jeep to sit with your passengers, they ordered the light of the jeep to be put off? 
A 
They were the ones who put off the light, sir. 
Q 
When you said that you take a look at their faces, it means to say that you take only a passing glance at their faces, correct?
A 
Yes, sir. 
Q 
When you were just taking a passing glance of the faces of those four men, you did not actually describe (sic) their faces, is that correct? 
A 
Some of them I can describe but the others I cannot, sir.
Q 
When you arrived at the place where the jeep stopped, is it not a fact that the place was dark? 
A 
Darked (sir), sir. 
Q 
While you were there, you were not able to recognize the faces of the four men, correct?
A 
No more because it was dark, sir.
[17]
 (Underlining supplied)
The quoted portion, rather than support Pulusanâs contention, show that Gomez, although gripped by fear, was able to look at and see the malefactors. While it may be true that Gomez had only occasional glances at the men, this does not mean that he could not have been able to recognize them. The most natural reaction of victims of violence is to strive to see the appearance of the perpetrators of the crime and observe the manner in which the crime was being committed.
[18]
 
We also consider the following testimony of Cresenciano Pagtalunan, thus: 
                                                                                                
Q
When these four passengers boarded the jeepney, was the jeepney inside lighted or not?
A
The jeepney was lighted, sir.
Q
Did you look at the faces of these four persons who boarded the jeepney?
A 
I came to know their faces when they passed by me and announced that it was a hold-up, I happened to look at them, sir. 
Q
In fact you looked at their faces and you have only a glimpse of their faces, correct?
A 
Yes, sir. 
Q 
Did you have glimpses of these four persons who boarded at Malolos or only one of them? 
A 
I saw their faces because there was still light inside the jeep, sir.
[19]
This testimony was corroborated by Marilyn Martinez who affirmed that when the four men boarded the jeep, the light inside the jeep was still on. She was able to recognize the men because they entered the jeep one by one. Moreover, Marilyn testified that even though the light inside the jeep was off, because they travelled quite a long distance, lights from the vehicles following them provided enough illumination.
[20]
 When they arrived at the isolated 
talahiban
 in Sto. Tomas, one of the robbers switched on the headlights of the jeep. After the repeated rape of Marilyn, the light inside the jeep was already on.
[21]
 Furthermore, appellant Rodriguez, who was the first to rape Marilyn, dragged her to the 
talahiban
 by passing in from to the jeep with its headlights on. She was looking at him, pleading for mercy.
[22]
 
This Court has time and again held that the relative weight and significance of evidence on visibility depend largely on the attending circumstances and the discretion of the trial court. The Court has considered as sufficient for identification illumination from a kerosene lamp
[23]
 from a flashlight,
[24]
 in the same way that the Court considered as enough lighting for identification purposes the âmediumâ light inside a jeepney which was passing through a dark place.
[25]
 In the instant case, the factor of visibility was in favor of the eyewitnesses. Such identification by all of the three prosecution eyewitnesses, not only by one, could not have been coincidental or contrived.
In an attempt to discredit the eyewitnesses and their testimonies, Pulusan points out these âconflicting testimonies:â (1) Gomez and Marilyn testified he poked a knife at Gomez while Pagtalunan said that he was holding a 
sumpak
; (2) Gomez testified that it was Pulusan who brought Marilyn to the 
talahiban
 while according to Marilyn, it was Rodriguez who brought her first to that place; (3) Gomez testified that they went to the PC headquarters the day following January 20, 1986 while Pagtalunan testified that they did so four days later; and (4) Gomez contradicted his testimony on direct examination that the crime transpired on January 20, 1986 by his testimony on cross-examination that the incident happened on February 20, 1986.
We find these alleged contradictions too trivial to affect the prosecutionâs case. Far from eroding the effectiveness of the testimonies of these eyewitnesses, such trivial differences are in fact indicative of veracity.
[26]
 Witnesses testifying on the same event do not have to be consistent in every detail considering the inevitability of differences in their recollection, viewpoint or impression. Total recall or perfect symmetry is not required as long as the witnesses concur on material points.
[27]
 The prosecution, contrary to appellantâs contention has also proven beyond reasonable doubt that the four men, Pulusan and Rodriguez included, conspired in the commission of the crime. In conspiracy, direct proof of a previous agreement to commit a crime is not necessary. It may be deducted from the mode and manner by which the offense was perpetrated, or inferred from the acts of the accused themselves when such points to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.
[28]
 
Pulusan and Rodriguez boarded the jeep together with two companions at the same time in Barangay Tikay. When Pulusan announced the hold-up, Rodriguez and their companions simultaneously brandished knives and the sumpak and divested the passengers of their money and valuables. When the jeepney reached an isolated place, the men took turns in raping Marilyn, inflicting physical harm on four male passengers who all succumbed to repeated clubbing and stabbing. After the carnage, the four malefactors walked towards the same northerly direction. Apparent then is the unity of purpose and design in the execution of the unlawful act.
[29]
 And where the conspiracy is shown, the precise extent of participation of each accused in the crime is secondary and the act of one may be imputed to all the conspirators.
[30]
 
Pulusan and Rodriguezâs respective alibis cannot prosper. Apart from the fact that they situated themselves in places not too far from the crime scene, there was no proof that it was physically impossible for them to have been at the 
locus criminis
 during its commission.
[31]
 Most of all, their respective alibis collapse in the face of the positive identification of them as the perpetrators of the crime.
[32]
 
The crime of charged in the information was âhighway robbery attended with multiple homicide with multiple rape.â Highway robbery or brigandage is defined in Sec. (2) of Presidential Decree No. 532, otherwise known as the âAnti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law of 1974,â as:
(t)he seizure of any person of ransom, extortion or other unlawful purposes, or the taking away of property of another by means of violence against or intimidation of person or force upon things or other unlawful means, committed by any person on any Philippine Highway.
As manifest in its preamble, the object of the decree is to deter and punish lawless elements who commit acts of depredation upon persons and properties of innocent and defenseless inhabitants who travel from one place to another thereby disturbing the peace and tranquility of the nation and stunning the economic and social progress of the people. A conviction for highway robbery requires proof that the accused were organized for the purpose of committing robbery indiscriminately. There is no such proof in this case. Neither is there proof that the four men previously attempted to commit similar robberies indiscriminately.
[33]
 
The trial court thus correctly found Pulusan and Rodriguez guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide aggravated by rape under Article 294(1) of Revised Penal Code. In the interpretation of an information, controlling is not the designation but the description of the offense charged. Under the allegations in the information, Pulusan and Rodriguez are liable under the aforesaid article of the penal code.
[34]
 
We must state that regardless of the number of homicides committed on the occasion of a robbery, the crime of still robbery with homicide. In this special complex crime, the number of persons killed is immaterial and does not increase the penalty prescribed in Art. 294 of the Revised Penal Code.
[35]
 There is no crime of robbery with multiple homicide under the said Code.
[36]
 The same crime is committed even if rape and physical injuries are also committed on the occasion of said crime. Moreover, whenever the special complex crime of robbery with homicide is proven to have been committed, all those who took part in the robbery are liable as principals therein although they did not actually take part in the homicide.
[37]
 
Rape had not been proven to be original intention of the appellants, the crime having been committed simply because there was a female passenger in the jeep. Hence, rape can only be considered as an aggravating circumstance and not a principal offense.
[38]
 Under Art. 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code, robbery with homicide is punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 to death. Considering the attendance of rape as a generic aggravating circumstance, the maximum penalty of death should be imposed. However, by reason of Section 19(1), Art. III of the 1987 Philippine Constitution which proscribes the imposition of the death penalty and considering further that at the time the crime was committed, Republic Act No. 7659 entitled âAn Act to Impose the Death Penalty on Certain Heinous Crimesâ reimposing the death penalty had not yet been enacted, the imposable penalty is 
reclusion perpetua
. Because 
reclusion perpetua
 is a single indivisible penalty for the special complex crime of robbery with homicide, the same shall be imposed regardless of the attending aggravating or mitigating circumstances.
[39]
 
The Court gives credence to the findings of the trial court as to the items to be returned or equivalent amount to be reimbursed to the victims of robbery, as well as the actual damages claimed and proven by the windows of the slain, victims. However, the civil indemnity for the heirs of the deceased victims should be increased to P50,000.00 in conformity with jurisprudence.
[40]
 
As to the moral damages awarded to Marilyn Martinez, the same should be increased pursuant to this Court's ruling that the offended party in the crime of rape is entitled to moral damages in the amount of at least P50,000.00; but in casses where multiple rapes are committed against one victim, as in this case where the victim suffered four rapes by four men, the victim should be awarded no less than the amount of P200,000.00 as moral damages.
[41]
 
WHEREFORE
, the Decision dated June 5, 1990 of the Regional Trial Court, Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 12 convicting appellants Eduardo Pulusan and Rolando Rodriguez of the crime of robbery with homicide is hereby 
AFFIRMED
 subject to the modifications that the heirs of the four (4) slain victims shall each be entitled to an indemnity of P50,000.00 and the rape victim, Marilyn Martinez, shall be awarded moral damages in the amount of P200,000.00. Appellants shall be liable jointly and severally for the monetary awards.
