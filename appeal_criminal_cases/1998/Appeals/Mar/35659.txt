PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE
RENATO ALBAO @ JUN AND JOSE ALENO, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


Self-defense must
be established by clear and convincing evidence. Likewise, the fact that the
victim initiated the unlawful aggression does not give the person defending an
absolute license to kill.  Where
unlawful aggression on the part of the victim is not proven, there can be no
self-defense.  On the other hand, denial
and alibi, while inherently weak, assume relevance when the evidence of the
prosecution linking the accused to the crime is inconclusive.


The Case


These are the
doctrines we apply in resolving this joint appeal of Renato Albao and Jose
Aleno
[1]
 before this Court challenging the
March 14, 1994 Decision
[2]
 of the Regional Trial Court of
Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Branch 47, in Criminal Case No. 9215 convicting
them of murder and sentencing each of them to 
reclusion perpetua
.
[3]


On February 22,
1991, Prosecutor III Clarito A. Demaala filed against appellants an Information
dated February 18, 1991 which reads:


âThat on or about the 28th day of
October, 1990 at the Reservation, Poblacion, Municipality of Quezon, Province
of Palawan, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court,
the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together and mutually
helping one another with evident premeditation and treachery, all armed with
bladed weapons and with intent to kill did then and there wilfully, unlawfully
and feloniously attack, assault, hack TANGKOY, hitting him in various vital
parts of his body and inflicting upon him multiple hack and stab wounds,
thereby causing internal and external hemorrhage that cause[d] shock which were
the direct and immediate cause of his instantaneous death.


CONTRARY TO LAW.â
[4]


At their
arraignment on May 9, 1991, the two accused, assisted by Counsel R. D. Vigonte,
pleaded not guilty.
[5]
 After trial in due course, the court

a quo 
rendered its assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which
reads:


âWHEREFORE, premises considered,
the prosecution having successfully proven its case, the Court hereby finds the
two (2) accused herein, RENATO ALBAO and JOSE ALEÃO guilty beyond reasonable
doubt as co-principals of the crime of MURDER as defined and penalized under
Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and there being no mitigating
circumstance to attenuate the offense committed, the Court hereby sentences
each of them to 
RECLUSION PERPETUA
 which shall be served at the national
penitentiary, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila; to indemnify the heirs of the victim
Onsing Tangcoy the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (
P
50,000.00) as actual,
moral and exemplary damages; and to pay the costs.


The herein convicted prisoners are
ordered immediately shipped to the New Bilibid Prison, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila
to serve their sentence there and not at the Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm or
any of the sub-colonies in this City, as they are âbarlessâ prisons.


IT IS SO ORDERED.â


In view of the
penalty imposed upon them, the two accused filed separate appeals before this
Court.

The Facts


Version of the Prosecution


The prosecution
presented three witnesses:  (1)  Albinio Usa and  (2)  Tabita Tangkoy, who
were both eyewitnesses, as well as  (3)  Dra. Josieveline Abiog, who
testified on the results of her medical examination and autopsy report.  The prosecutionâs version of the facts, as
narrated by the solicitor general, is as follows:


The following facts are culled from
the testimony of the victimâs widow, Tabita Tangcoy:


On 28 October 1990, Tabita went to
buy rice at the market place of Poblacion, Quezon, Palawan.  After doing her errand, she proceeded home
to Barrio Tagbae, also of the same municipality. (p. 5, TSN, 14 November 1991)


Upon reaching Reservation (still
within the Poblacion), at or around 5:30 p.m. of even date, she chanced upon
her husband, Onsing Tangcoy, and Albinio Usa, who were also on their way
home.  Together, the three of them
proceeded on foot. (p. 27, TSN, 14 November 1991).


After some time, they reached a
place where appellants were drinking.  Appellant Albao called Onsing.  Tabita dissuaded him from responding to the call.  Heedless, Onsing approached appellants.  Tabita then decided to proceed on her way.
(pp. 28-30, TSN, 14 November 1991)


Momentarily, Tabita looked back and
saw her late husband facing appellant AleÃ±o, with his back turned to appellant
Albao.  The latter, then, suddenly
hacked Onsing at the back.  Tabita ran
away upon seeing this, and when she looked back while running away, she saw her
husband sprawled on the ground.  When
Onsing shouted for help, she saw appellant AleÃ±o come out and raise his bolo in
a hacking gesture at her late husband.  This was the last scene she saw, as she continued her sprint for home.
(pp. 31-38, TSN, 14 November 1991)


Around eighteen
(18) hours after the incident, the victimâs cadaver was autopsied by Dr.
Josieveline Abiog, the Municipal Health Officer of Quezon, who stated in her
autopsy report (Exh. âDâ) that the cause of the victimâs death is âbrain
injury, internal and external.â (p. 21, TSN January 1992)â
[7]


On the other
hand, the trial court summarized the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, 
viz.
:


âTestifying for
the prosecution, Albenio
[8]
 M. Usa, 19 years old, single,
out-of-school youth, and residing in Tagbae, Tabon[,] Quezon, Palawan since
birth, elicited the following facts.


On September 28, 1990, at 5:30
oâclock p.m., he was at Salvacion, Quezon, Palawan in company with Onsing Tangkoy.  There was an unusual incident that happened
wherein Onsing Tangkoy was hacked by Jun or Renato Albao.  He saw the backing [sic] and killing and he
identified and pointed to Jun Albao at the courtroom as the killer of Onsing
Tangkoy.


While they were walking and Jun or
Renato Albao was having a drinking spree with his co-accused AleÃ±o, he (Jun
Albao) called for Onsing Tangkoy.  They
were on the ground and he saw Jun or Renato Albao hacked [sic]  Onsing Tangkoy with a bolo at a distance of
about 7 armslengths [sic].  There was
still sunlight when this happened.  Onsing Tangkoy was hacked at his back.  After he saw this hacking he ran away.


He knows the wife of the victim
Tabita Tangkoy.  She was there when the
incident happened.  She also saw the
incident.  He executed a sworn statement
about this case (Exhibits âAâ, âA-1â and âA-2â) before the police in Quezon,
Palawan in Tagalog and in question and answer form which he signed.  He confirmed the truth of the contents of
his statement.


On cross
examination, he elicited [sic] the following facts:


The hacking incident he mentioned
above happened at the reservation, poblacion, Quezon, Palawan.  They came with Onsing Tangkoy from a certain
Taliog and the two (2) of them were walking.  Onsing Tangkoy is not related to him but he is his friend.  Onsing Tangkoy was not armed at that
time.  Renato Jun Albao was bringing a
bolo and he saw him hacked [sic] Onsing Tangkoy who died right away as a
result.  It was the victimâs wife,
Tabita who told him that the victim had died because she waited and she also
saw Jun Albao hacked [sic] her husband.  Onsing, Tangkoy who was wounded at the right side of his back, near his
shoulder (the witness demonstrated a wound about 4 inches long). [sic] The bolo
used by Renato Jun Albao is about one and a half (11/2) feet long.  He saw plenty of blood that came from the
victimâs wound.  He knows the accused
Renato Jun Albao long time ago as he is his neighbor.


The next
prosecution witness presented is [sic] Tabita Tangkoy, 33 years old, farmer,
widow, and residing at Tagbae, Tabon, Quezon, Palawan since birth.  She testified as follows:


On October 28, 1990 at about 5:00
oâclock p.m., she bought rice from the market, poblacion, Quezon.  Her husband is Onsing Tangkoy who died
October 28, 1990 because he was hacked by Jun Albao and Joe AleÃ±o which she saw
on her way home.  She saw Jun Albao and
Joe AleÃ±o already drunk.  She knows them
and she identified and pointed to them inside the courtroom.  Her husband was hacked at his back.  After she saw the first hacking of her
husband by Renato Albao, she ran away and heard her husband asked [sic] for
help.  Then Jose AleÃ±o went out
immediately from the place where they were drinking bringing a bolo and he
hacked her husband suddenly after her husband shouted, hitting him although she
does not know the exact area of the body her husband was hit.  Albao used a bolo in hacking her husband
which she demonstrated to be about one and a half (11/2) feet long.  The bolo brought out by Joe AleÃ±o which she
saw is an ordinary bolo.  Her husband
was hacked once by Renato and then Joe AleÃ±o approached him (her husband) also
with a bolo but she did not see if he used that bolo against her husband
because she already ran away.  Albao and
AleÃ±o are relatives, AleÃ±o being Albaoâs uncle.  The following morning she saw her husband, Onsing Tangkoy in the
place where he was hacked.  She does not
know how many wounds were inflicted upon him.  Her husbandâs companion while walking during the hacking incident is
Albenio Usa.  She knows how to sign her
name a little and she executed a sworn statement (Exhibits âBâ, âB-1â and
âB-2â) about her husbandâs death which she narrated to the police, who
explained the contents thereof to her.


She cried when her husband died of
hacking as his life is priceless.  She
spent 
P
5,000.00 which she borrowed for his wake and transportation in
going to Puerto Princesa.  They have two
(2) children, one 16 years old and the other, 5 years old.  Her husbandâs ears were detached and his
right arm was lamost [sic] severed or disconnected.


On cross-examination, he [sic]
elicited [sic] the following facts.


Her husband was a farmer.  Before the hacking incident she came from
the market where she bought rice and sold her corn.  Her husband was arm less [sic] or without a bolo or knife.  His companion, Albenio Usa did not also have
any bolo.  She passed by the place where
the accused were drinking and then she heard her husband called by Renato Albao
to join them.  She saw her husband got
near and when he approached them she saw Albao hacked [sic] him.  Her husband drank a little liquor and was a
little drunk.  When her husband was
called she prevented him from going there but Jun Albao told her:  âI will take case [sic] of your husbandâ and
then advised her to go ahead of him (her husband).  Her husband got near the accused upon being called.  Then, she saw her husband hacked by Jun
Albao with the bolo he was bringing. Her husband was looking at AleÃ±o when
hacked by Albao.  She saw Albao hacked
[sic] her husband at his back and then she ran away looking backwards.  She did not see Joe AleÃ±o hacked [sic] her
husband.  After her husband was hacked
by Renato Albao he faced Albao and told him he would not fight him.  She did not see Joe AleÃ±o hack her husband
although she saw AleÃ±o in the act of hacking her husband (which the witness
demonstrated).  As she was in an
elevation she saw AleÃ±o âin the act of hackingâ her husband while AleÃ±o was
getting near him.  She knows it was her
husband Joe AleÃ±o wanted to hack.  AleÃ±o
and Albao were together.  While Joe
Albao was âin the act of hackingâ her husband, Albao thrust the bolo forward.


The prosecution presented the Death
Certificate of the victim, Onsing Tangkoy (Exhibits âCâ, âC-1â, âC-2â and
âC-3â), the existence, contents, genuineness and due execution of which the
defense admitted.


The next prosecution witness who
testified is [sic] Dr. Josieveline Abiog, 32 years old, M.D., single and a
Government Health Officer of the Municipal Health Office of Quezon, Palawan,
since March, 1987, and residing in Quezon, Palawan.


She testified that she examined the
cadaver of Onsing Tangkoy and prepared an Autopsy Report on her examination
(Exhibit âDâ, âD-1â, âD-3â and âD-4â).


Her findings on the cadaver of the
victim as stated in the Autopsy Report (Exhibit âD-3â) are: âwound, stabbed,
2.5â throat; wound incised, severing the muscles of the face, left; wound
incised palm, left; wound incised 1.5â, dorsum, arm, left; wound incised elbow,
left; wound incised 2â, dorsum, forearm, left; wound stabbed, 2.5 cm., scapular
area, right; wound stabbed, paraumbilical area, left with intestinal
evisceration fracture, comminuted, temporo-occipital area, left, with brain
tissues coming outâ.


She said that the intestine of the
victim came out; that there is [sic] a fracture of the occipital area of the
victim; and that the victimâs brain tissues came out; that the victim sustained
nine (9) injuries all in all, and that the fracture in the victimâs head is the
most fatal, followed by the injury in the paraumbilical area; that the first
eight (8) wounds were caused by a sharp instrument, while the 9th injury was
caused by a blunt instrument, that the assailantâs position in inflicting wound
No. 8 is at the back of the victim, causing the fracture of his head; that the
first eight (8) wounds were caused by a sharp pointed instrument and this [sic]
could have been inflicted by two (2) assailants.


The cause of Death of the victim as
reflected in said Autopsy Report (Exhibit âD-4â) is hemorrhage, internal and
external and brain injury.  About
eighteen (18) hours had already elapsed from the death of the victim to the
time the autopsy examination was conducted on his cadaver.  The victim was muscular and young but the
cadaver already started to smell.


On
cross-examination, she declared the most fatal injury is the fracture in the
victimâs head.  The assailant might be
embracing the victim and moved backward in inflicting the back wound.  There is no way to determine which wound was
inflicted first.  The prosecution
formally offered its evidence and rested its case, on January 18, 1992.â
 
[9]


The Autopsy
Report contained the following findings:


âPreliminary Findings:


The body when examined was in the
state of rigor mortis wearing dark colored pants stained with blood sprawled in
the grass.


Post-mortem findings:


wound, stabbed, 2.5.â throat


â  incised, severing the muscles of the face, left


â  â  palm,
left


â  â  1.5â,
dorsum, arm, left


â  â  elbow,
left


â  â  2â,
dorsum, forearm, left


â  stabbed, 2.5 cm., scapular area, right


â  stabbed, paraumbilical area, left with intestinal evisceration
fracture, comminuted, temporo-occipital area, left, with brain tissues coming
out


Cause of Death:


BRAIN INJURY


HEMORRHAGE,
INTERNAL AND EXTERNALâ
[10]


Version of the Defense


In contrast to
the prosecutionâs theory that the two appellants conspired in the killing, the
appellants in their separate briefs claim that it was only Renato Albao who
singlehandedly killed Tangkoy and, even so, only in self-defense.  The defense presented five witnesses,
namely:  (1)  Nelly Mercader and  (2)  Jose Canale, who testified
as eyewitnesses for the defense;  (3)  Renato Albao, who admitted
killing the victim in self-defense;  (4)  Jose Aleno, who offered denial and alibi;
and  (5)  Arturo ReÃ±o who corroborated Alenoâs defense.


Appellant Albao
narrated his version of the facts as follows:


âOn October 28, 1990, (Appellant
Renato Albao) was already residing in that place.  At about 5:30 oâclock p.m. that date he was in the âbodegaâ of
Nelly Mercader to get sacks for the corn Nelly Mercader was buying from him as
he has been her corn seller since 1984.  He got these sacks and carried them and asked permission from Nelly
Mercader to leave.  While going down the
âbodegaâ, something happened where a person named Onsing Tangcoy challenged him
by saying at a distance of  about four (4)
meters:  âThank you, Jun, that we
met.  Now I will finish your life!â  Tangcoy who was carrying a bolo at that time
holding it upwards, approached Renato Albao who, on seeing this dropped the
sacks he was carrying and then took out the scabbard containing a bolo from his
waist and defended himself with the scabbard.  Then, Onsing Tangcoy with a bolo raised in his hand approached him
(Renato Albao) and hacked him twice but he (Albao) evaded the blow and was not
hit.  On the third blow he (Renato
Albao) already unsheathed his bolo and simultaneously hacked Onsing Tangcoy
(âsinabayan ng tagaâ), hitting him (Onsing Tangcoy) on his left side above his
left ear.  They face [sic] each other
and he (Renato Albao) again hacked Onsing Tangcoy as the latter embraced him
but he was not able to hit him and they wrestled with each other, after which
they both fell down and his (Renato Albaoâs) bolo was thrown away but Onsing
Tangcoy continued to hold his bolo which he wrestled and took it [sic] from him
after that he (Renato Albao) moved four (4) steps backwards but followed him
(Onsing Tangcoy) to grab his bolo.  On
stepping backwards he (Albao) waited for Tangcoy and then hacked and stabbed
him (Tangcoy) several times even when the latter was already defenseless.  Tangcoy tried to fight back by trying to
grab the bolo from him (Albao) to no avail.  Then Onsing Tangcoy fell to the ground and he (Renato Albao) shouted for
help as he intended to surrender with his bolo to the police.  (Decision[,] page 7)


(Nelly Mercader) is a resident of
Reservation, Quezon, Palawan since 1978 and knows Renato Albao as he is her
âsukiâ in buying corn.  On October 28,
1990 at around 5:30 oâclock p.m., while she was in her house, Renato Albao went
to her house to get a sack.  After
getting sacks, Renato Albao asked permission from her to go home and suddenly
Onsing (referring to the deceased Onsing Tangcoy) arrived and at a distance of
4 armslength said: âNANDITO KA LANG PALA JUN, KATAPUSAN MO NA NGAYONâ and
pulled out his bolo and hacked Renato Albao who parried the hacking blow with
the scabbard of his bolo.  Because of
this, Renato Albao defended himself using his bolo and hacked Onsing Tangcoy
who was hit and wounded on his head.  She closed the door of her house when Onsing Tangcoy was hit for the
first time on his head.  (Testimony of
Nelly Mercader[,] pages 4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13[,] hearing on July 13, 1992).


(Jose Canale) was already residing
in Reservation, Quezon, Palawan, on October 28, 1990.  In the afternoon of that date, he was walking on the road of
Reservation, Quezon, Palawan for home from his farm at Tagpapasi, Quezon,
Palawan about two (2) kilometers away without any companion.  While walking an incident happened wherein
at a distance of about ten (10) meters away he saw Renato Albao bringing
sacks.  He emerged from the âbodegaâ of
Nelly Mercader.  He also saw Onsing
Tangcoy walking and then shouted words which he did not understand.  Onsing Tangcoy then suddenly hacked Renato
Albao and the latter (Albao) pulled his bolo from its scabbard and also hacked
Onsing Tangcoy.  Albao defended himself
with the scabbard of his bolo.  He was
not hit when Onsing Tangcoy hacked him twice.  Renato Albao hacked Onsing Tangcoy, hitting him four (4) or five (5)
times which he saw and as a result Onsing Tangcoy died.  He did not do anything because he was
shocked.


He knows Jose
Aleno since 1979 when he arrived in that place, but he did not see him there
during the incident.  Renato Albao had
no companion at that time.  He (Jose
Aleno) was already residing in Barangay Mangingisda, Puerto Princesa City since
1986 and he has not seen him there in Reservation, Quezon, Palawan on October
28, 1990.  He knows Tabita Tangcoy, the
wife of Onsing Tangcoy.  The testimony
of Tabita Tangcoy that Jose Aleno also came out of the store and likewise
hacked Onsing Tangcoy is not true.  He
did not see Tabita Tangcoy there.â
[11]


For his part,
Jose Aleno simplifies the facts, as follows:


â1.
           
The
victim died on 28 October 1990, at about 5:30 p.m., in Sitio Reservation, Poblacion,
Quezon, Palawan;


2.
 
The
victim sustained several wounds, some of which were fatal while some were not,
which wounds caused his death;


3.
 
Albao
inflicted the wounds on the victim;


4.
 
Aleno
has been a resident of Brgy. Mangingisda, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan
continuously since 1986;


5.
 
On
28 October 1990, Aleno was incumbent president of Purok Magsasaka, Brgy.
Mangingisda, Puerto Princesa City;


6.
 
On
October 28 1990, there was a barangay assembly in Brgy. Mangingisda, Puerto
Princesa City, which lasted from 1:30 p.m. until 5:00 p.m.;


7.
 
Quezon,
Palawan is about 150 kilometers away from Puerto Princesa City, Palawan.  The travel time between the said places is
from 4 to 5 hours; and,


8.
 
When Albao showed Aleno a copy of their warrant
of arrest, the latter immediately left Brgy. Mangingisda, Puerto Princesa City,
and voluntarily surrendered to the police authorities of Quezon, Palawan;â
[12]


The Issues


In his brief,
Appellant Renato Albao imputes to the trial court the following errors:


âI.
 
The lower court erred in not holding that the herein appellant acted
in lawful self defense


II
   
The
lower court erred in declaring herein appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt
of the crime of murder and by imposing [sic] him to suffer an imprisonment of 
reclusion
perpetua.
â


On the other
hand, Appellant Jose Aleno, in his separate brief, claims that the trial court
committed the following errors:


âI.
 
Giving full credence and weight to the testimony of prosecution
witness Tabita Tangcoy who incurred material and substantial inconsistencies;


II.
  
Concluding that Aleno mutually helped and therefore conspired with
Albao to attack the victim on the basis of Tabita Tangcoyâs statement that
Aleno approached Albao and the victim carrying a bolo, after the latter shouted
for help;


III.
 
Convicting Aleno of murder despite the marked absence of evidence
showing his guilt beyond any reasonable doubt;


IV.
          
Totally disregarding, without any reason, the testimonies
of the other prosecution and defense eyewitnesses who positively declared that
Albao was present, while Aleno was not, at the 
locus criminis
 when the
victim was killed;


V.
 
Disregarding
Alenoâs defense of alibi[,] his doubtful identification and evidence
satisfactorily showing the physical impossibility of his presence at the 
locus
criminis
 when the victim was killed;


VI.
          
Concluding the attendance of the qualifying circumstance of
treachery in the killing of the victim on the basis of a non-fatal wound on the
back of the victim; and,


VII.
          
Declaring the absence of any mitigating circumstances
despite evidence of voluntary surrender by Aleno.â


In the main, two
principal issues are submitted for the consideration of this Court:


1.
 
Whether
Appellant Renato Albao established self-defense


2.
 
Whether
the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of Appellant Jose
Aleno


The Courtâs Ruling


We acquit
Appellant Aleno, but we find Appellant Albao guilty of homicide. 


First Principal
Issue:


Did Appellant Albao Kill in Self-Defense?


Appellant Renato
Albao admits that he inflicted the injuries which led to the death of the
victim, but claims that he âacted in lawful self-defense.â
[13]
 In view of this admission, the
burden of evidence shifts to him.  Thus,  he  must  prove the elements of self-defense with clear and convincing evidence.
[14]
 This he failed to do before the
trial court, and now before us. 


The testimonies
of the defense witnesses, specifically those of Albao himself, Nelly Mercader
and Jose Canale, sought to prove that it was the victim, Onsing Tangkoy, who
initiated a bolo attack on said appellant.  Their testimonies, however, contain serious and irreconcilable
inconsistencies.  On the stand, Mercader
and Canale claimed that Albao, on seeing the victim approach with a raised
bolo, immediately pulled out his own weapon and parried the attack with his
scabbard.
[15]
 Mercader saw only one hack
[16]
 while Canale witnessed two hacks.
[17]
 In contrast, Albao himself alleged
that he intentionally refrained from unsheathing his bolo but merely evaded the
first two hacks of the victim.  After
the third attack, however, he pulled out the bolo from its scabbard and
exchanged hacks with the latter.
[18]
 Moreover, it is undisputed that
only the victim was wounded in this deadly encounter.  Appellant Albao was unscathed.  This circumstance casts doubt on Albaoâs theory that there was unlawful
aggression on the part of the victim.  In any event, it is significant that the trial court did not give
credence to this claim of unlawful aggression.  


Absent proof of
such aggression, there can be no self-defense.  Well-settled is the rule that the trial courtâs assessment of the
credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is binding and conclusive, in
the absence of any showing that it had overlooked, misapprehended or misapplied
some facts of weight and substance which, if properly considered, would warrant
a different conclusion.
[19]
 In this case, Albao has not given
us sufficient reason, as indeed we find none, to deviate from this
doctrine.  


There is an
equally cogent reason for rejecting the claim of self-defense.  Unlawful aggression, assuming arguendo its
presence, does not give Albao any license to kill.  He can put up only a reasonable response to the threat or peril
posed on his life and limb.  Hence,
after Albao had already neutralized the threat and was no longer in peril,
there was no more reason for him to kill the aggressor.  After inflicting on the victim the first
wound -- a mortal one at that, which fractured the skull, causing brain tissues
to ooze out, thereby rendering the said victim defenseless and prostrate --
Appellant Albao took the bolo of the deceased and continued his vicious
aggression.  Clearly, the threat to
Appellant Albaoâs life -- assuming there was any -- had ended.  Nonetheless, appellant proceeded to stab the
throat and the other parts of the victimâs body.  All in all, he inflicted nine wounds.  The nature, the number and the gravity of said wounds speak not
of defense but of a criminal intent to kill the deceased.  Indeed, â(i)t may be that, after the first
few blows, one who acts in self-defense might deal a few more blows without
changing the character of his defense, if this was done out of confusion or
fear, but, after delivering several blows, to inflict a stab wound in the
victimâs throat as a 
coup de grace 
would be to negate any semblance of
good faith and manifest a deliberate and wanton intention to kill.â
[20]
 In this regard, it is also
well-settled that âwhen the unlawful aggression which has begun no longer exists,
the one making the defense has no more right to kill or even wound the former
aggressor.â
[21]


We hold that
Appellant Albao failed to prove with clear and  convincing evidence that he had acted in lawful self-defense.  Indeed, his manifest intent was not to
defend himself but to kill the victim.


Second Principal
Issue


Appellant Jose Aleno Entitled to an
Acquittal


The totality of
the evidence presented in the instant case fails to prove  beyond reasonable doubt Jose Alenoâs
guilt.  The two prosecution witnesses
miserably failed to establish Alenoâs participation in the criminal act.


Prosecution
Witness Albinio Usa, who was the companion of the deceased that fateful
afternoon, categorically stated that only Appellant Albao was at the crime
scene, and it was he alone who hacked the victim.  He testified:


âQ
   
While
you were walking with Oncing Tangcoy, do you remember of any unusual incident
that happened?


A
    
Yes,

who killed Oncing Tangcoy?


A

This
killing, how was it done?


A
    
While
we were walking, Your Honor, and June Albao was having a drinking spree, he
called for him.


Q
    
Jun
Albao called for Oncing Tangcoy?


A
    
Yes,

whom?


A

On the other
hand, while Tabita Tangkoy testified that Aleno was at the crime scene, she did
not categorically say that he participated in the slaying of her husband.  True, she vaguely referred to Aleno as
having brought a bolo, but she did not see him actually strike her husband or,
for that matter, assist Albao in the criminal enterprise.  She testified thus:


âQ

[23]
 (Underscoring supplied.)


Indeed, Tabita
admitted that her testimony regarding Alenoâs participation in the crime was
based on a mere presumption or supposition: 


Q
    
You
said that while you were running and looking back, tyou [sic] saw Joe Aleno
approaching the two, Renato Albao and your husband, 
yet you did not see
whether he also hacked your husband, correct?


A
    
Yes,
Sir.


Q
    
In
fact you did not know whether Aleno would hack your husband or Albao, correct?


A
    
Of
course, if he was about to hack June, Jun would have been wounded.


Q
    
But
the fact is, you did not see Aleno hack anybody?


A
    
In
my opinion, Aleno went near in order to hack somebody.


COURT:


Q
    
Thatâs
only your âhaka-hakaâ.  The question is,
did you see him hack or not?


A
    
Not
yet, Your Honor.


Q
    
You
should be truthful if you really saw or not.


A
    
I saw him in the act of hacking, Your Honor,
because I already ran away.  But I 
presumed

that he was going to hack somebody.â
[24]
 (Underscoring supplied.)


It is
well-settled that âmere suspicions and speculations can never be the bases of a
conviction in a criminal case.â
[25]
 But this is not all.  The prosecution eyewitnesses not only failed
to prove Alenoâs participation in the criminal act; they also contradicted each
other on a fundamental fact -- Tabita Tangkoy testified that said appellant was
present at the crime scene, with bolo in hand, but Usa categorically stated
that âit was only June Albao whom I saw hacked [sic] him,â without mentioning
that Aleno was at the same place. 


Moreover, Tabita
Tangkoyâs claim that she saw Aleno at the 
locus criminis
 is less than
credible.  She testified that, after
seeing the first wound inflicted, she was still able to observe Jose Aleno, who
was allegedly armed with a bolo, approach the victim.  Albinio Usa, on the other hand, averred that he immediately fled
after the first hack.  However, Tabita
testified that she left her husband while Usa was still with him; in other
words,  she  fled  from  the  scene  ahead of Usa,
[26]
 who testified that only Albao
attacked the victim.  How then could she
have seen Aleno when Usa, who stayed longer at the crime scene, did not?


Tabitaâs
subsequent conduct further diminishes the credibility of her account.  She stated that,  after seeing her husband hacked and in mortal danger, she just
ran away to their house located âfar from the place of the incident.â
[27]
 She made no attempt to help him or
to report the incident to the police or to the barangay officials.  She did not even return to the 
situs

of the crime that same night.  


When asked by
the prosecutor how she felt upon learning of her husbandâs death, she answered,
âI was shocked and I became sad and I cried, Maâam.â
[28]
 If Tabita saw the mortal wound
sustained by her husband at 5:30 in the afternoon of the previous day, why
would she be shocked at all upon learning about his demise the next morning,
when she should have been worrying over and fearing for his fate the whole
night?  We reiterate the well-recognized
rule that âevidence, to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a
credible witness, but must be credible in itself  --  such as the common
experience of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.  We have no test of the truth of human
testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge, observation, and
experience.  Whatever is repugnant to
these belongs to the miraculous and is outside of judicial cognizance.â
[29]
 


In any event, we
stress that the prosecution has the burden of proving Appellant Alenoâs guilt
beyond reasonable doubt.  The law
requires âno less than moral certainty or proof beyond reasonable doubt to
offset the presumption of innocence.â
[30]
 No such proof was mustered by the
prosecution against Appellant Aleno. 


Appellant Alenoâs Alibi Relevant


In view of the
weakness of the prosecutionâs evidence against Aleno, his denial and alibi assume
importance.  Significantly, the
testimonies of Defense Witnesses Nelly Mercader and Jose Canale convincingly
show that they did not notice said appellant at the crime scene.
[31]
 Canale narrated the facts which
occurred from the moment the attack began until the victimâs death, and he
never mentioned Alenoâs presence, much less, his participation.
[32]
 Hence, we cannot lightly dismiss
the claim of said appellant that he was at Purok Magsasaka, Barangay
Mangingisda,  Puerto  Princesa  City,  attending,  in  his capacity as purok president,  a barangay assembly meeting from 1:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon of
October 28, 1990.
[33]
 Appellant Alenoâs alibi is
corroborated by the simple and unbiased testimony of Arturo ReÃ±o:


âATTY. CRUZAT:

Because
we were present then during that meeting, your Honor.


Q
    
Yes,
but that was four years ago.


Q
    
Did
you jot this down in your calendar or you have a habit of memorizing the date
in the calendar?


A
    
I can still remember that date, your Honor,
because that was the time when I received my lot.â
[34]


As found by the
trial court, the distance between Puerto Princesa and the crime scene in the
Municipality of Quezon is 150 kilometers and it would take about 3-1/2 to 4 hours
to travel this distance by public transport, and about 3 hours by private
vehicle.
[35]
 Since Appellant Jose Aleno left
Puerto Princesa about 5:00 p.m., and the crime was committed at approximately
5:30 p.m., his presence at the crime scene was a physical impossibility.  


Conspiracy Not Sufficiently Proved


In light of the
foregoing, the trial court clearly erred in finding that the two appellants
conspired in killing the victim.  Like
the elements of an offense, conspiracy must be established by proof beyond
reasonable doubt.  To establish
conspiracy, there must be proof that  two or more persons agreed to commit the crime.  Direct proof of the said agreement is not
indispensable, because conspiracy may be inferred from the concerted acts of
the accused indubitably revealing their unity of purpose, intent and sentiment
in committing the crime.
[36]
 In the present case,  there was no proof of such prior agreement
between the two appellants.  Indeed,
conspiracy could not be inferred, for, as discussed above, there was no
sufficient evidence that Appellant Jose Aleno was present at the crime scene at
all.  


Homicide Not Murder


Finally, we
disagree with the conclusion of the trial court that 
alevosia
 qualified
Albaoâs crime.  Relying on the testimonies
of the two prosecution witnesses, the court 
a quo
 found that Albao
âhacked [the victim] at his back where he has no eyes to see and evade the
attack.â
[37]
 Because of the evidentiary rule
that the prosecution must prove treachery as clearly as the crime charged,
[38]
 we cannot sustain the trial
court.  The physical evidence on record
does not support the finding of treachery.  The victim did not sustain any wound in his back, and the wounds
referred to in the autopsy report imply an assault from the front or the side,
an angle of attack well within the view of the victim.  Moreover, the prosecution failed to describe
the events that immediately preceded the alleged attack.  In other words, the qualifying circumstance
of treachery cannot be based on the mere allegation that Albao hacked the back
of the deceased, especially when this is not corroborated by the physical
evidence.  We cannot conjecture or
assume that Albao, who was drunk at the time,  adopted such means as to deprive his victim of any chance to defend
himself or of any avenue for escape. In view of the deficient evidence  presented by the prosecution on this point,
we cannot ascribe treachery since, as already stated, this qualifying
circumstance must be proven as clearly and as cogently as the crime itself. 


Likewise, we
cannot appreciate evident premeditation.  To establish  this qualifying
circumstance, it must be shown that there was a period sufficient to afford
full opportunity for meditation and reflection and a time adequate to allow the
conscience of the actor to overcome the resolution of his will.
[39]
 The premeditation to kill must be
sufficiently proven by evidence of outward acts showing the intent to kill.
[40]
 In the present case, there is no
evidence of planning or preparation to kill.   It was not shown that there was a prior incident between the
deceased and Albao.  The evidence
clearly demonstrates that the fatal encounter between Albao and the victim was
casual and unplanned.  Prosecution
Witness Albinio Usa testified that the victim was simply passing by when Albao
allegedly called him â to his death, as it turned out. 


Damages


The trial court
ordered appellants to pay to the heirs of the victim the amount of 
P
50,000
as actual, moral, and exemplary damages.  The trial court, however, did not indicate the basis for the award, and
we have not found any from the records.  We, therefore, cannot sustain it.  In line with jurisprudence, however, we award to the heirs of the victim
the same amount of 
P
50,000 as indemnity.  This award requires no proof other than the fact that a crime has
been committed, and that appellant was responsible for it.
[41]
 


WHEREFORE,
 the appealed Decision is 
MODIFIED
