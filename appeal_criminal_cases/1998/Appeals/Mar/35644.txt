ROMERO, J.:


Once again, the Court is called
upon to resolve a case arising from the senseless killing of an innocent
countryside civilian by misguided elements hiding under the protective wings of
the New Peopleâs Army (NPA).  For the
crime, Nestor Matubis 
alias
 
Ka Sherma
, Emilio Delgaco 
alias Ka
Boy 
and an unidentified cohort were charged with murder under the following
information:


âThat on
or about the 24
th
 day of March, 1988, at Barangay La
Purisima, Municipality of Nabua, Province of Camarines Sur, Philippines, and within
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, who are still at
large, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, armed with
38 Caliber Revolver and 45 Caliber pistol, with intent to kill, with treachery
and evident premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously shoot one Alfonso Sales, Jr., on the different parts of his body,
thereby causing direct and immediate death of the victim to the damage and
prejudice of his heirs in the amount of no less than Fifty Thousand Pesos (
P
50,000.00),
Philippine Currency.


ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.â


Alfonso Sales, Jr., a 23-year-old
bachelor who took the two-year course for auto mechanic at the University of
Northeastern Philippines in Iriga City, helped his parents manage the operation
of four jeepneys.  From time to time, he
would drive one of the jeepneys for which he would receive an average
commission of P100 a day out of the fares paid by passengers.  He set aside a certain amount of his
earnings for his personal needs and used the balance to buy food for his family
in La Purisima, Nabua, Camarines Sur.
[1]


At about 7:00 oâclock in the
evening of March 24, 1988, Sales was playing chess with Walter Lompero in front
of the Breboneria Store in La Purisima. Watching the game were Teodoro Baldoza,
Edgar Breboneria, Roberto Agonos, Edwin Dante and a fifth person.  About thirty minutes later, four persons,
who appeared to be new to the place, passed by and proceeded towards the
direction of the La Purisima Elementary School.   Informed by Lompero and Baldoza of the presence of these persons,
Sales advised the two not to mind them.


After about two minutes, Nestor
Matubis approached Sales by passing by Lomperoâs left side.  From a distance of one armâs length from
Baldoza and three meters from Lompero, they saw Matubis shoot Sales on the
temple twice.  Matubis was armed with a
.45 caliber pistol. Around ten meters away, Emilio Delgaco blocked the
road.  Lompero saw that Matubis was
wearing a pair of 
maong
 pants and white T-shirt.   After recovering from shock, Lompero ran
towards a coconut plantation some fifteen  meters away.  From there, he saw
Delgaco shoot Sales with a .38 caliber revolver.  He clearly saw all these despite the distance, as a street light
illuminated the place very well.
[2]


Baldoza saw Delgaco holding a .38
caliber gun, but because he ran towards the Breboneria Store to seek cover
under the bed, he did not see Delgaco shoot Sales. While lying on the floor,
however, he heard three more gunshots.
[3]


The postmortem examination
conducted by Dr. Audie Margate, municipal health officer of Nabua, Camarines
Sur, revealed that Sales sustained the following wounds:


1.
     
Gunshot wound, semi-circular, at the temporal region behind the
base of the left ear directed upward to the right with inverted tissues with
contusion collar at the point of entry and with no point of exit.


2.
     
Gunshot wound, semi-circular with contusion collar and inverted
tissues around the point of entry at the later aspect, right eyebrow, directed
downward to the left, also with no point of exit.


3.
     
Gunshot wound, semi-circular, with
contusion collar with inverted tissue at the 8
th
 intercostal space, left posterior
axillary line, likewise with no point of exit.


4.
     
Gunshot wound with contusion collar and
inverted tissue at the 4
th

intercostal space, right posterior axillary line, directed upward to the right.
This wound was superficial and not penetrating.


5.
     
Gunshot wound, semi-circular with inverted tissue and contusion
collar, at the right posterior lumbar area, midscapular line, directed upward
and with no point of exit.


Dr.
Margate recovered a slug embedded underneath the skin at the level of the 4
th
 intercostal space, right anterior axillary line.
[4]


According to Dr. Margate, wounds
1, 2, 3 and 5 were fatal while wound 4 was not because it was only superficial
and did not penetrate the body.  Death
was due to hypovolemic shock, secondary to hemorrhage brought about by the
multiple gunshot wounds.
[5]
 Dr. Margate turned over the slug he recovered from
the body to the Nabua police.


P/Cpl. Josefino O. Rebolado
admitted having custody of the slug recovered from the body of the victim.  He presented before the trial court said
slug as well as the empty shells of bullets from the different kinds of
firearms that were recovered from the crime scene.
[6]


According to the victimâs father,
Alfonso Sales, Sr., his family spent 
P
25,000.00 for funeral parlor
services
[7]
 as a result of the death of his son. The family
spent 
P
30,000.00 for food during the wake but there were no receipts for
the latter expenses.
[8]


Matubis and Delgaco denied the
accusation against them.  Matubis
admitted that he was a member of the NPA, charged with the job of lecturing to
the masses.  He was not issued a
firearm.  Instead, although he reached
only first year high school, he was given a book called 
Pangkalahatang
Kursong Masa 
and he lectured in Balatan from 1983 to 1986.
[9]
 It was only in the latter year that he went to La
Purisima to visit Eva Pilapil Occiano who later became his wife. In that year,
he moved to Manila where he cohabited with Eva.  The following year, her parents encouraged him to avail of the
amnesty program of  the government.  Thus, when the crime transpired, he was in
Manila applying for the 
balik-loob
 project for members of the NPA under
the amnesty program.  He was arrested on
January 5, 1989 inside a jeepney in a parking area in Sta. Mesa, Manila while
following up his petition for amnesty, but no warrant of arrest was shown to
him.  He was brought to the CAPCOM
office where he was detained for three days.  On January 9, 1989, he was brought to the Nabua Police Station.  He claimed that he did not know any of the
prosecution witnesses, as well as the victim.
[10]


Emilio Delgaco, 45 years of age,
admitted that he had been a member of the NPA since 1986.  He was given the assignment of collecting
money and 
palay
 from farmers in Patag and Salvacion, Bato, Camarines Sur
but since birth, he had always resided in San Vicente, Ogbon, Nabua, Camarines
Sur.  He knew that Madahon is adjacent
to Ogbon as it could be seen from a distance and that Sto. Domingo separates
Madahon from La Purisima.  He learned of
the latter fact only in 1989 when he passed by Sto. Domingo while he was on the
way to La Purisima with Roger AcompaÃ±ado.  In June, 1988, he surrendered to Cpl. Melchor Chuchi Prades in his home
in San Miguel, Nabua, Camarines Sur after his brother, Elpidio, had been shot
in the knee by members of the NPA.  To
begin a new life, he availed of the 
balik-loob
 project of the
government.  He denied knowing any of
the prosecution witnesses nor the victim and alleged that the first time he met
his co-accused, Nestor Matubis, was in the police station in Bicol.  He claimed that Walter Lompero implicated
him in the case after he had refused to testify against Nestor Matubis.
[11]


On May 24, 1990, the trial court
found both accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and
rendered the decision
[12]
 with the following decretal portion:


âWHEREFORE, premises
considered, the Court finds the accused, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of Murder, defined and penalized under Art. 248, par. 1 of the Revised
Penal Code.  Accordingly, after applying
the indeterminate sentence law, the accused, NESTOR MATUBIS and EMILIO DELGACO,
are each sentenced to suffer imprisonment for a period of 12 years and 1 day to
17 years, 4 months of prision mayor maximum to reclusion temporal medium in its
medium period and for both accused to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs
of Alfonso Sales, Jr. the sum of 
P
55,000.00, Philippine Currency and to
pay the costs.


SO ORDERED.â


Both accused interposed an appeal
to the Court of Appeals.
[13]
 On July 19, 1990, the trial court ordered that the
entire record of the case be forwarded to said appellate court.
[14]
 On July 24, 1990, appellant Delgaco filed a motion
to post bailbond pending appeal.
[15]
 The trial court, having granted the motion on July
30, 1990, appellant Delgaco posted a P40,000.00 bailbond,
[16]
 after which he was released on bail on September 8,
1990. Nestor Matubis, who likewise posted a bailbond, was also released on
September 13, 1990.
[17]


On December 29, 1992, the Court
of Appeals rendered the Decision
[18]
 affirming the trial courtâs decision insofar as it
found the appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder qualified
by treachery but decreeing as follows:


âPREMISES CONSIDERED, the
decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED by finding accused-appellants Nestor
Matubis âAliasâ Ka Sherma and Emilio Delgaco âAliasâ Ka Boy guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder without any mitigating or aggravating
circumstance and, as a consequence, this Court hereby imposes upon each of them
the penalty of 
Reclusion Perpetua.


Considering that the
penalty of 
Reclusion Perpetua
 has been imposed in the instant case, the
same is now certified to the Honorable Supreme Court for eview (sic).


SO ORDERED.â


This Court accepted the appeal on
May 19, 1993.  On even date, we ordered
the commitment of appellants to the New Bilibid Prison.
[19]
 As it was only appellant Delgaco who appeared and
voluntarily surrendered to the Court,
[20]
 we ordered the cancellation of the bond posted by
appellant Matubis and directed the issuance of a warrant of arrest against him.
[21]
 On February 21, 1995, Alfredo G. Memije, Chief of
the PNP Criminal Investigation Command, Department of Interior and Local
Government, informed this Court that the warrant of arrest against appellant
Matubis could not be served as he was nowhere to be found in La Purisima,
Nabua, Camarines Sur.
[22]
 Hence, on March 13, 1995, this Court ordered the
dismissal of the appeal of Matubis and the corresponding forfeiture of the bond
he had posted.
[23]


In compliance with the Courtâs
directive, counsel for appellant Delgaco filed a manifestation on August 22,
1995 that he was adopting the appellantâs brief he had filed with the Court of
Appeals to avoid repetition of arguments.
[24]
 The Court granted appellant Delgacoâs prayer on
September 6, 1995.
[25]
 In his brief, appellant Delgaco alleges that the
trial court erred in: (a) finding that prosecution witnesses Lompero and
Baldoza positively identified him; (b) relying on the âuncorroborated,
inconsistent and unreliable statement of prosecution witnesses,â and (c)
convicting him of the crime charged despite the prosecutionâs failure to prove
his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.


The pivotal issue in this appeal
is one of credibility of witnesses and their testimonies.  Time and again, this Court has held that it
will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in determining the credibility
of witnesses unless there appear on record some facts or circumstances of
weight and influence which have been overlooked or the significance of which
has been misinterpreted by the same trial court.  The reason behind this dictum is that the trial judge enjoys the
peculiar advantage of observing directly and at first hand the witnessesâ
deportment and manner of testifying.  He
is, therefore, in a better position to form accurate impressions and
conclusions on the basis thereof.
[26]
 The trial courtâs conclusions on the issue of
credibility are in fact buttressed by the failure of the defense to attribute
any false or evil motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses that could
have impelled them to perjure themselves against appellant.  Hence, their testimonies are entitled to
full faith and credit.
[27]


We are convinced that appellant
Delgaco had been positively identified as one of the persons who shot
Sales.  While it was only Lompero who
saw appellant shoot the victim, his positive and credible testimony stands unaffected.  Unless expressly required by law, the
testimony of a single witness, if found credible and positive, is sufficient to
convict.
[28]
 Truth is established not by the number of witnesses
but by the quality of their testimonies.
[29]


The Court disagrees with
appellantâs contention that Lomperoâs reaction upon seeing the incident is
contrary to the human instinct of self-preservation.  The general or common rule is that witnesses to a crime react in
different ways.
[30]
 As this Court has held in a number of cases,
witnesses of startling occurrences react differently depending upon their
situation and state of mind, and there is no standard form of human behavioral
response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful
experience.  Witnesses to a surprising
event see differently some details thereof due in large part to the excitement
and confusion that it usually brings
[31]
 and the fact that what may be rational for one may
be strange to another.
[32]


Witness Lomperoâs having seen
appellant Delgaco shoot Sales as he looked back after taking refuge in the
coconut plantation some fifteen meters away
[33]
 is not necessarily contrary to the human instinct of
self-preservation.  It should be
observed that he first secured his safety by running towards the coconut
plantation before looking back.  Moreover, appellantâs argument that the same witness could not have
identified him from a distance of fifteen meters considering that the incident
happened at night is not tenable.  In
the first place, an electric street lamp lighted the place.
[34]
 Secondly, Lompero had known appellant even before
the incident because, for a period of two years, appellant and Matubis were
known in the place as members of the NPA.
[35]
 Notably, in 
People v. Castillo,
[36]
 
the Court
held that once a person has gained familiarity with another, identification
becomes quite an easy task even from a considerable distance.  It is, therefore, not implausible that from
a distance of fifteen  meters,  Lompero could have recognized and identified
appellant.


It was not only Lompero who
established appellantâs presence in the crime scene. Witness Teodoro Baldoza
also testified that he saw appellant holding a gun although he failed to see if
appellant used it as, after the second shot fired by Matubis, he fled to the
Briboneria store.
[37]
 The fact that appellant was carrying a gun at the
crime scene supports the testimony of Lompero that the former indeed
conspiratorially participated in the killing of Sales. Thus, even assuming that
Lompero failed to see appellant fire his gun at Sales, still, by his acts of
carrying the gun and blocking the road,
[38]
 a community of criminal design with Matubis to kill
Sales was manifest.  A person found in
conspiracy with the actual perpetrator of the crime by performing specific acts
with such closeness and coordination as the one who executed the criminal act
is equally guilty as the latter.
[39]


With regard to the failure of the
witnesses to immediately report the incident to the proper authorities, we hold
that the delay they incurred does not affect, much less impair their
credibility, because such delay was satisfactorily explained.
[40]
 It was due to the fact that the witnesses were cowed
by the reputation of the two accused who were admittedly members of the NPA,
[41]
 on top of the fact that appellant was a resident of
a nearby barangay in the same town of Nabua.  As this Court has held, it is equally understandable for a witness to
fear for his safety especially when town mates are involved in the commission
of the crime because an inculpatory statement can easily provoke retaliation.
[42]
 The initial reluctance of witnesses to volunteer
information about a criminal case and their unwillingness to be involved in
criminal investigations due to fear of reprisal is common and has been
judicially declared not to affect credibility.
[43]


The Court finds no
inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.  While both Lompero and Baldoza called the
attention of the victim to the presence of some four persons whom they referred
to as ânew faces,â such description of appellant may be explained by the
circumstances under which it was used.  It is of judicial notice that in places where the NPA operates, the
local folks refer euphemistically to the members of that group as ânew faces,â
sometimes in fear and at other times to distinguish them from the residents of
the area. 


There was no inconsistency
between the number of wounds sustained by the victim as found by the examining
physician and the testimonies of Lompero and Baldoza.  Dr. Margate found five gunshot wounds.  Lompero 
saw 
Matubis shoot the victim twice and, after he
had fled and looked back, he 
saw
 appellant shoot the victim once.
[44]
 On the other hand, Baldoza 
saw
 how Matubis
fired the two initial gunshots and 
heard 
three more shots as he laid on
the floor of the Breboneria Store.
[45]
 Even assuming that these are inconsistencies, they
do not necessarily affect the fact that the victim sustained five gunshot
wounds during the incident.  By the
swiftness of the occurrences, it is but natural that Lompero might not have
counted accurately the gunshots.  The
same prosecution witnessesâ failure to declare the same number of shots fired
during the incident does not signify at all that they prevaricated.  On the contrary, the fact that the
testimonies of Lompero and Baldoza are not exactly on all fours with each other
obliterates the suspicion of a rehearsed testimony. Whatever âinconsistenciesâ
may seem apparent to the appellant are actually badges of truth rather than of
falsehood.
[46]
 What is important is that Lompero positively
identified appellant as one of the assailants.
[47]
 The alleged inconsistency is trivial but
understandable considering the suddenness of the attack, the dreadful scene
unfolding before the witnessesâ eyes, as well as the imperfection of human
memory.
[48]
 


Appellantâs defenses of denial
and alibi cannot prevail over their positive identification by the prosecution
witnesses who had no motive to falsely testify against him.
[49]
 Besides, appellantâs uncorroborated alibi failed to
prove that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the crime scene
during its commission.
[50]


Clearly, appellant committed the
crime of murder.  The killing is
qualified by the proven circumstance of treachery that was manifested by the
swift and unexpected attack on the unarmed victim without the slightest
provocation on his part.
[51]


The Court of Appeals correctly
imposed the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua.
  The crime of murder is punishable by the penalty of 
reclusion
temporal
 in its maximum period to death.
[52]
 In the absence of mitigating or aggravating
circumstances, the proper imposable penalty is the medium period of said
penalty or 
reclusion perpetua.
[53]


WHEREFORE
, the Decision of the Court of Appeals, finding
appellant Emilio Delgaco guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder
and imposing upon him the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 that was
certified to this Court for review, is hereby AFFIRMED subject to the
MODIFICATION that appellant shall be civilly liable to the heirs of Alfonso
Sales, Jr. in the amount of fifty thousand pesos (
P
50,000.00).


Let a copy of this Decision be
furnished the Philippine National Police and the Department of Justice which
shall cause the arrest of Nestor Matubis whose appeal has been dismissed for
his failure to submit to the authority of this Court.  Costs
