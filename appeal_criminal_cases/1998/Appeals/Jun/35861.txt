PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. GABRIEL CIPRIANO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




REGALADO, J.:


Accused-appellant Gabriel Cipriano has come to this Court praying for the reversal of the decision
[1]

 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 6-A, of Palo, Leyte, finding him 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder for the violent death of 
Cresencia Mirasol.

In an information
[2]
 
filed on August 15, 1990 and docketed as Criminal Case No. 90-08-339, 
appellant was charged with murder allegedly committed as follows:



That on or about the 3rd day of February, 1990, in the City of 
Tacloban, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused with deliberate intent to kill and with 
treachery and evident premeditation, armed with a gun, did then and 
there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack and shoot CRESENCIA 
MIRASOL with said gun hitting and wounding her on the body, thereby 
inflicting upon said Cresencia Mirasol gunshot wound which caused her 
death.
  




At his arraignment with the assistance of counsel, appellant pleaded not guilty to the crime charged
[3]

 and, thereafter, the trial of the case proceeded. Presented as 
witnesses by the prosecution were Emma Balo, Geronimo Mirasol, Arnulfo 
Reyes, Dr. Angel Cordero, Pat. Federico Tan, Pat. Alberto Modesto, Ruben
 Espeleta, SPO1 Jose Talagtag, T/S Teodoro Fornillo, and Vicente de 
Vera. Their testimonies, with the documentary evidence adduced in the 
course of the proceedings, presented the case for the People.

Emma Balo, a subordinate of victim Cresencia Mirasol in the 
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), testified that 
at around 10:00 oâclock in the evening of February 3, 1990, she was at 
the residence of the victim. While seated across each other at a table 
in the carport and working on the final deployment of personnel of the 
DENR, they were startled by a loud explosion which sounded like a 
firecracker.

She heard victim Mirasol ask, â
Ano adto, Em
?â (What was 
that, Em?). She could not immediately answer the victim as she was 
stunned by that strong burst of sound. She then heard Mirasol utter, â
Agi, agi
,â
[*]

 and saw her hold her chest while slowly reclining her head forward on 
the table. Seeing blood flowing out of the back of the victim, she 
placed her hand on the wound in an attempt to stanch the bleeding. At 
the same time, she called Geronimo Mirasol, the victimâs brother who 
lived next door and, together, they thereafter brought the victim to the
 hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival.
[4]


Geronimo Mirasol testified that he was awakened by his wife who 
heard a gunshot and noticed a commotion in the house of Cresencia. When 
he arrived there, he saw his sister lying on the floor near the carport,
 bathed in her own blood. He asked Emma Balo as to who shot his sister 
and she replied that she saw a man wearing a black jacket in the 
immediate vicinity. The following morning, he went behind the house of 
his deceased sister and noted several footprints and tire marks near the
 wall.
[5]


He further revealed that prior to February 3, 1990, there were 
altercations between him and herein appellant. Their quarrels started 
sometime in June 1988 when the son of appellant broke the jalousies of 
his house with a slingshot. When appellant learned that his son was 
being blamed for the broken jalousies, he went out of his house bringing
 with him his .38 caliber revolver and challenged Geronimo Mirasol to a 
fight, which provocation the latter prudently ignored.

The same incident again happened in October 1989, this time with 
appellant firing his armalite rifle in the air. Cresencia Mirasol who 
heard the gunshots, went out of her house, confronted the appellant and 
tried to pacify him, but he arrogantly replied, â
Malabad kamo
â 
(You are both troublesome.) In December 1989, the jalousies of the house
 of victim Mirasol were hit and broken by a slingshot. She did not 
complain but she suspected that it was committed by the same person 
responsible for the previous incidents.
[6]


Prosecution witness Arnulfo Reyes testified that at around 10:30 
in the evening of February 3, 1990, while coming from Hollywood Street 
on his way to his auntâs house, he heard a gunshot emanating from Texas 
Street. While looking for a safe place to hide in the corner of Texas 
and San Francisco Streets, he saw appellant coming out from the gutter 
near the house of victim Mirasol. Appellant, who was holding a gun in 
his right hand, then got hold of the steering bar of a bicycle, tucked 
the gun in his waist, and rode away on the bicycle. This witness easily 
recognized herein appellant because he was just five meters away from 
him, the place was well lighted, and the witness knew him well since 
they were distant relatives.
[7]


Arnulfo Reyes also testified that at around 8:00 oâclock in the 
evening of February 11, 1990, during the fiesta celebration at V&G 
Subdivision, he was on his way on board a pedicab to the grounds of the 
fair being held there when he heard somebody calling him, â
Ongkong
.â
 When he looked back, he saw appellant pointing a gun at him. He 
immediately jumped out of the pedicab and ran but he was hit in the back
 by a bullet. Appellant tried to shoot him again but, luckily, this time
 he was not hit. He hurriedly proceeded to his house and was later 
brought to the hospital for medical treatment.
[8]


He further declared that the reason why appellant tried to kill 
him was because he had knowledge of the killing of Cresencia Mirasol, 
and that he had executed a sworn statement implicating herein appellant 
as the assailant.
[9]


Dr. Angel Cordero,
[10]
 
who conducted a necropsy examination on the body of deceased Cresencia 
Mirasol on February 4, 1990, affirmed in court that the cause of her 
death was shock due to massive hemorrhage caused by a gunshot wound in 
the chest, lacerating the heart.
[11]

 He opined that the assailant could have been standing on an elevated 
level behind the victim, as the point of entry of the slug was at her 
back.
[12]


Patrolman Federico Tan, a member of the Pastrana Police Station 
since May 1988, was assigned as police officer of the day on February 3 
and 4, 1990. He testified that herein appellant was assigned as a market
 guard from 6 oâclock in the evening of February 8, 1990 to 8 oâclock in
 the morning of the following day, but appellant did not report for duty
 on that day and during the scheduled hours of his assignment.
[13]


Patrolman Alberto Modesto, also a member of the Pastrana Police 
Station since 1978, testified that sometime in February 1990, appellant 
talked to him about his desire to pledge his .45 caliber pistol, the 
proceeds of which he planned to use in the forthcoming fiesta 
celebration. The witness referred appellant to his nephew-in-law, Ruben 
Espelita, who was residing in Barangay Astorga. Appellant met him again 
after the fiesta and told him that he needed additional money as he was 
involved in a shooting incident in their subdivision. Witness Modesto 
also confirmed that prior to February 1990, he often saw appellant in 
possession of that same pistol in the Pastrana Police Station.
[14]


In open court, while testifying as a prosecution witness therein,
 he was able to identify that firearm which he saw in the possession of 
appellant, and was later pledged to Ruben Espelita, as an Ithaca .45 
caliber pistol bearing Serial No. 1233458.
[15]


Prosecution witness Ruben Espelita, Barangay Captain of Barangay 
Astorga, Alang-alang, Leyte, corroborated the testimony of Patrolman 
Modesto about the .45 caliber pistol that was pledged to him by 
appellant. He testified that said appellant went to see him thrice: 
first, on February 9, 1990, when the appellant pledged the pistol to him
 for P3,500.00; second, on February 28, 1990, when appellant asked for 
additional money but was not able to get any; and, third, in the third 
week of March 1990 when he was able to get an additional amount of 
P2,000.00 from this witness.
[16]


On April 5, 1990, by virtue of a search warrant, a Criminal 
Intelligence Service (CIS) team went to Espelitaâs house to search for 
that pistol, and his wife voluntarily surrendered the gun in question. 
He was investigated in the CIS headquarters in Tacloban City and was 
informed that said firearm had been used as a murder weapon.
[17]


Witness Espelita further averred that, in connection with the 
pledge of that gun to him, he requested appellant to sign a receipt but 
the latter refused by calling attention to the fact that they had after 
all entered into a gentlemenâs agreement. Espelita did not insist 
anymore on a receipt from appellant because of their supposed agreement 
and the fact that appellant had been referred to him by his own 
relative.
[18]


SPO1 Jose P. Talagtag, a member of the Philippine National Police
 (PNP)-CIS in Ormoc City, took the stand and narrated that he was 
assigned to investigate the death of Cresencia Mirasol. A certain 
Patrolman Jun Reyes approached and informed him that his brother, 
Arnulfo Reyes, had knowledge about the incident. He interrogated Arnulfo
 Reyes and a sworn statement
[19]

 was executed and signed by the latter. He also learned from Dr. Cordero
 that a slug was taken from the body of the victim and marked with an 
initial âCM.â That slug had been turned over to the Philippine 
Constabulary (PC) Crime Laboratory for safekeeping.
[20]


He further testified that it was his team which applied for and 
secured a search warrant from Judge Pedro S. Espina for the recovery of 
the getaway bicycle, the jacket allegedly worn by the assailant, and the
 .45 caliber pistol used in the shooting of Cresencia Mirasol. Said 
bicycle and jacket were found in and recovered from the residence of 
herein appellant, while the pistol was found in and retrieved from the 
residence of Ruben Espelita in Alang-alang, Leyte.
[21]

 He also made the clarification that when that pistol was confiscated, 
he immediately turned over the gun to T/Sgt. Fornillos of the PC Crime 
Laboratory for ballistic examination.
[22]


T/Sgt. Teodoro Fornillos, who was assigned as Chief Clerk of the 
PC/PNP Crime Laboratory Service Station in Palo, Leyte, confirmed that 
he was the one who received and supervised the ballistic test fire 
examination on the .45 caliber Ithaca pistol with Serial No. 1233458. He
 informed the trial court that said pistol, together with the test-fired
 bullets and the slug taken from the body of Cresencia Mirasol, were 
brought to Camp Crame for ballistic examination.
[23]


Vicente de Vera, Chief of the Ballistic Branch of the PNP Crime 
Laboratory at Camp Crame, testified that he personally received and 
conducted the ballistics examination on the subject gun and slug. Based 
on his examination he concluded that the slug marked with an initial 
âCMâ was fired from the .45 caliber Ithaca pistol with Serial No. 
1233458, the same gun that was allegedly pledged to Ruben Espelita by 
appellant and subsequently confiscated by police authorities.
[24]
 He accordingly issued Ballistic Report No. B-1-179-90
[25]
 setting out those findings.

Appellant, on the other hand, denied killing Cresencia Mirasol 
and raised an alibi as his defense. He contended that in the evening of 
February 3, 1990, he was at the Gov. Jaro Coliseum for a scheduled 
cockfight derby, hence he failed to report for duty as a market guard. 
He met Reginaldo Rosalio, who had a gamecock entry which participated 
and won in the derby, while the latter was drinking in one of the 
canteens of said coliseum. He was invited by Rosalio to join him at 
their table. They waited for the prize money until 11:00 oâclock in the 
evening and then proceeded to Rosalioâs house in Phase 5, V&G 
Subdivision for an extended celebration. He did not stay long, but went 
ahead of the group and proceeded to the so-called shed house to buy some
 fish.

He met Asterio Colipano in the shed house and requested the 
latter to bring him home. Colipano agreed to do so after he shall have 
delivered the twelve â
baÃ±eras
â of fish to the market. 
Thereafter, they proceeded from the market to Phase 4 of V&G 
Subdivision. Appellant alighted at the waiting station of the 
subdivision and then walked all the way home. Arriving at the gate of 
their house at around 2:00 oâclock in the morning of February 4, he 
noticed several persons in the house of Cresencia Mirasol. He was 
informed that Mirasol had been shot and was rushed to the hospital.
[26]


The defense also presented Reginaldo Rosalio and Asterio Colipano
 to corroborate the alibi of herein appellant. Rosalio further asserted 
that herein appellant was with their group from the time they met at the
 canteen up to 12:00 oâclock midnight of February 3, 1990 when he left 
for home.
[27]


Unimpressed by appellantâs defensive version, the trial court 
rejected appellantâs defense and accordingly found him guilty as 
charged, pronouncing on him this condemnatory judgment:



WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused, GABRIEL CIPRIANO, GUILTY 
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder as defined and penalized 
under the Revised Penal Code and is thereby sentenced to reclusion 
perpetua, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, Cresencia Mirasol, 
(in) the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.
[28]






Hence, this appeal, with appellant faulting the trial court as having
 erred in finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of 
murder. He bases his appeal mainly on the alleged insufficiency of the 
circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution to sustain his 
conviction, considering that nobody saw who actually shot Cresencia 
Mirasol.

He argues that the prosecution failed to establish his alleged 
possession or ownership over the .45 caliber pistol used in the killing 
of the victim as no documentary evidence was presented to prove that he 
pledged that gun to Espelita.

He likewise assails the trustworthiness and credibility of the 
prosecution witnesses by ascribing ulterior motives to them. He 
particularly rails against Pat. Alberto Modesto whom he claims testified
 as he did in order to protect his relative, Ruben Espelita, from whom 
the pistol was seized and for which he could be held liable for its 
illegal possession; and Arnulfo Reyes whom he charges was actuated by 
ill motives to falsely testify against him because of previous incidents
 between them,
[29]
 as earlier narrated.

Appellantâs appeal is without merit. Ergo, we affirm.

It is a settled rule that direct evidence of the commission of a 
crime is not the only matrix wherefrom a trial court may draw its 
conclusion and finding of guilt.
[30]

 Trial courts are allowed to rule on the bases of circumstantial 
evidence, and judgments of conviction based on such species of evidence 
can be upheld if (1) there are more than one circumstance; (2) the facts
 from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (3) the 
combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction 
beyond reasonable doubt.
[31]


In the case at bar, several items of circumstantial evidence were
 presented, and all of which conduced to the identification of the 
culprit, to wit:



(1) There had been previous altercations or unpleasant incidents between the victim and herein appellant;
  


(2) Witness Emma Balo, who was with the victim at the time of the incident, saw that the assailant was wearing a black jacket;
  


(3) Appellant was seen by witness Arnulfo Reyes as he came out from
 Texas Street wearing a black jacket and tucking a gun in his waist, 
just after Reyes heard a gunshot coming from said street where the 
victimâs house is located; 


(4) Appellant shot witness Arnulfo Reyes because the latter 
thereafter executed a sworn statement of what he saw and implicating 
appellant therein as the assailant of victim Mirasol;
  


(5) Appellant was the one who possessed and later pledged his .45 
caliber pistol to Ruben Espelita, which pistol was positively and 
scientifically identified as having fired the slug extracted from the 
body of the deceased; and
  


(6) The getaway bicycle and the black jacket worn by the assailant 
at the time of the incident were recovered from the house of appellant.
  




This catenation of circumstances, taken together with and drawn from 
appellantâs antecedent possession of the gun which was the instrument of
 the crime, form an unbroken chain which inevitably leads to a logical 
conclusion that herein appellant is guilty of killing Cresencia Mirasol.

Appellantâs strained argument based on the absence of any 
documentary evidence on the pledge of said gun does not negate the fact 
that he owned or was in effective control of it, as clearly and 
satisfactorily explained by Espelita in his testimony,
[32]
 Also, as ratiocinated by the Solicitor General:



Besides, the absence of such documentary proof does not necessarily
 mean that no such transaction ever took place between accused-appellant
 and Espelita, for it is of common knowledge that some people enter into
 such transaction(s) verbally or without the benefit of any document.
  


At any rate, given the trial courtâs finding that accused-appellant
 ânever denied possession or ownership of said pistolâ (p. 3, Decision),
 it is too late in the day for accused-appellant to refute (the) 
prosecutionâs theory of pledge in his desperate bid to deny ownership of
 the subject firearm, the use of which in the killing of the victim, 
accused-appellant admits, has been established by the prosecution.
[33]






The incriminating collage of facts against appellant, it should be 
noted, was created by circumstantial evidence anchored on the credible 
and unbiased testimony of the prosecutionâs witnesses. Consequently, 
this Court will not disturb but shall accord the highest respect to the 
trial courtâs findings on the issue of credibility of the witnesses and 
their testimonies, it having had the opportunity to observe their 
deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.
[34]


The attempt of herein appellant to discredit the testimony of the
 prosecution witnesses is unavailing. In fact, appellant himself 
admitted that he had no quarrel or differences with Pat. Alberto 
Modesto, and that witness Arnulfo Reyes is even his relative.
[35]

 There is no showing whatsoever that these prosecution witnesses were 
actuated by any improper motive to perjuriously impute to him such a 
serious charge. Thus, their forthright testimonies, are jointly and 
altogether, worthy of full faith and credit.
[36]


Appellantâs ascription of existing bad blood between him and 
Arnulfo Reyes, which supposedly impelled the latter to falsely testify 
against him, is both tenuous and untenable. It is noteworthy that Reyes 
had already executed a sworn statement and implicated him as the 
assailant of Cresencia Mirasol even before his aborted assault against 
Reyes in the February 11, 1990 shooting incident. Moreover, herein 
appellantâs attempt to kill Reyes was an obvious act of desperation on 
his part to prevent the latter from testifying against him. As held in 
People vs. Cabel
,
[37]

 the prior, contemporaneous and subsequent acts or conduct of the 
accused indicative of his guilt or tending to show that he committed the
 crime charged may be received as evidence against him.

Appellantâs defense of alibi must necessarily be rejected. He 
failed to prove that he was at some other place such that it was 
physically impossible for him to be at the 
locus criminis
 at the time of the alleged crime.
[38]

 Instead, the prosecution established that the house of the victim, 
Cresencia Mirasol, and appellants alleged whereabouts at the time she 
was killed, were both in the same locality in Tacloban City; and the 
houses of defense witness Reginaldo Rosalio and the victim were both 
located at V&G Subdivision, more or less one kilometer distant from 
each other. Evidently, it was physically possible for appellant to have 
been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission. His alibi 
becomes further implausible since it was attested to mainly by appellant
 and the aforesaid Reginaldo Rosalio, who is his relative and principal 
witness, thereby revealing its inherent unreliability and the facility 
of its concoction.
[39]


There is no need to belabor the conclusion that, from the facts 
of this case as hereinbefore discussed, the crime committed was murder 
qualified by treachery. There was insufficient evidence, however, of the
 aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation alleged in the 
indictment. Neither was this case attended by any other modifying 
circumstance which would further affect appellantâs criminal liability.

WHEREFORE
, the appealed judgment of the Regional
 Trial Court, Branch 6-A, of Palo, Leyte is hereby AFFIRMED in toto, 
with costs against accused-appellant Gabriel Cipriano.

SO ORDERED.
