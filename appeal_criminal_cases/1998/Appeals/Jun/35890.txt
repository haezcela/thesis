ARISTON A. ABAD, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.

ROMERO, J.:


Death struck like the proverbial thief in the night, but was the accused-appellant the perpetrator thereof?

In the early morning of October 28, 1986, Ana Paulin was in bed 
at her house in San Vicente, San Pedro, Laguna, when she was suddenly 
awakened by the cries of â
Inay, inay, inay
.â Startled, she 
bolted up, looked out of the window and saw a man alighting from the 
jeep parked in front of her house. She yelled at the man who looked up 
at her then ran away. When she opened the front door downstairs, she 
found her son, Roberto Pineda, sprawled on the doorstep. He had been 
repeatedly stabbed in the chest and back.

With the help of neighbors, she rushed Roberto to the Midtown 
General Hospital in San Pedro but was refused admittance due to the lack
 of medical facilities therein. Her son expired on the way to another 
hospital. At about 3:30 a.m., she reported the incident to the San Pedro
 police. It was only before noon of that same day, however, when she 
submitted a â
Salaysay
â identifying accused-appellant Ariston A.
 Abad as the man she had seen running away from her house moments before
 she discovered her sonâs bloody condition. She further stated that 
accused-appellant and Roberto had been enemies ever since her 
daughter-in-law, Susan, left the latter for accused-appellant, who was 
then married to a certain Evelyn Tagle. On the other hand, at the time 
of the incident, Roberto was cohabiting with a certain Mary Grace 
Pineda.

On that very day, accused-appellant was invited by their barangay
 captain to shed light on the incident and was subsequently detained, as
 a complaint against him had been filed.

On June 28, 1987, accused-appellant was formally charged in an information, reading as follows:



âThat on or about October 28, 1986, in the Municipality of San 
Pedro, Province of Laguna, Republic of the Philippines and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused ARISTON A. ABAD, with 
intent to kill, with evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength 
and treachery, being then conveniently armed with a deadly bladed 
weapon, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, 
assault and stab therewith one ROBERTO PINEDA Y PAULIN, who as a result 
thereof, sustained stab wounds on vital parts of his body which directly
 caused his death, to the damage and prejudice of his surviving heirs. 


That the crime was committed with the generic aggravating 
circumstance of evident premeditation and the qualifying circumstance of
 abuse of superior strength and treachery.
  


CONTRARY TO LAW.â
[1]






The case was assigned to Branch 22 of the Regional Trial Court of San
 Pedro, Laguna. Upon his arraignment on September 8, 1987, 
accused-appellant entered a plea of ânot guilty.â At the trial, the 
prosecution presented three witnesses, namely, Dr. Jose Lopez, Jr., Mary
 Grace Pineda, and Ana Paulin; the defense presented the 
accused-appellant and Evelyn Tagle.

Dr. Jose Lopez, Jr., the medico-legal officer who autopsied the 
body of the victim, testified that the deceased suffered fifteen stab 
wounds and seven multiple wounds, consequently dying of shock due to 
severe intra-thoracic hemorrhage secondary to multiple stab wounds at 
the chest and back.

Mary Grace Pineda testified that three days before the incident, 
accused-appellant had an altercation with Roberto over the child of the 
latter with Susan Paulin. The victim allegedly wanted to recover his 
child from Susan, which accused-appellant opposed. The two even came to 
blows over the matter, with mutual threats to kill each other.

On the other hand, accused-appellant denied the truth of Ana 
Paulinâs narrative, saying that on the evening of October 27, 1986, 
after selling sampaguita flowers at Pasay City, he went home to San 
Pedro at around 12:00 midnight, and that, he was already sleeping at the
 time the alleged stabbing incident occurred. His alibi was corroborated
 by his wife, Evelyn.

In its judgment rendered on November 27, 1991, the San Pedro RTC 
found accused-appellant guilty of homicide. The dispositive portion of 
the judgment reads as follows:



âWHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of the crime of HOMICIDE as defined and penalized under Article 
249 of the Revised Penal Code and taking into consideration the 
provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence law, there being no aggravating
 or mitigating circumstance to offset each other, he is hereby sentenced
 to suffer imprisonment of 8 years 1 day of prision mayor, as minimum, 
to 14 years 8 months and 1 day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, 
together with all the accessory penalties provided by law, and to 
indemnify the heirs of Roberto Pineda in the sum of P50,000.00 as 
damages. No costs. 


SO ORDERED.â
[2]






On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the lower court, hence the present recourse.

Accused-appellant assails his conviction by the lower court, 
maintaining that he could not be considered guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt and that the testimonial evidence of the prosecution lacked proof 
and facts to sustain his conviction.

We find accused-appellantâs arguments worthy of merit.

The most glaring feature of the present case is the lack of an 
eyewitness to the actual killing. No one saw accused-appellant stab the 
victim, nor was the murder weapon ever found. The only thing that links 
accused-appellant to the crime is his presence at the scene of the 
incident, thus, the reliance of the trial court on circumstantial 
evidence to convict accused-appellant.

For circumstantial evidence to be sufficient to support a 
conviction, all the circumstances must be consistent with the hypothesis
 that the accused is guilty and at the same time inconsistent with the 
hypothesis that he is innocent, and with every other rational hypothesis
 except that of guilt.
[3]
 
Thus, for circumstantial evidence to suffice for conviction, the 
following requisites must concur: (i) there must be more than one 
circumstance to convict; (ii) facts on which the inference of guilt is 
based must be proved; and (iii) the combination of all the circumstances
 is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. The 
circumstances established must constitute an unbroken chain leading to 
one fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused as the guilty
 person, to the exclusion of all others. In the present case, the Court 
is of the view that the circumstantial evidence proffered by the 
prosecution do not show beyond reasonable doubt that the accused 
perpetrated the crime for which he stands charged.

From a careful perusal of the records, it becomes clear that the 
court a quo affirmed accused-appellantâs conviction on the basis of the 
following pieces of circumstantial evidence:

First. Accused-appellant was seen at the scene of the crime from which he later hastily fled.

Second. Accused-appellant had a motive to kill the victim, having had an altercation with the latter three days before.

The above circumstances, in the absence of other corroborative 
evidence, do not point with moral certainty to the guilt of 
accused-appellant.

We have consistently held that the mere presence of accused-appellant at the 
locus criminis
 cannot be solely interpreted to mean that he committed the killing.
[4]

 The mere presence of accused-appellant at the crime scene, without 
more, is inadequate to support the conclusion that, indeed, he committed
 the crime. In fact, the only certain conclusion that can be drawn from 
the testimony of prosecution witness Ana Paulin is the fact that 
accused-appellant alighted from a parked jeep in front of her house and 
not that he killed the victim. This is clear from her testimony:



Q.    Now, after you hear the word âInayâ about three times, what did you do next if any? 


A.     I stood up âbumalikwas,â sir. 


Q.    Why did you stand up, why did you âbumalikwasâ? 


A.     I was surprised, startled, sir.
  


Q.    After standing up what did you do next?
  


A.     I look(ed) out through the window, sir.
  


Q.    What window is that?
  


A.     The window in front of our house, sir.
  


Q.    Why did you look out through that window in front of your house?
  


A.    Because I heard the shout came from that direction, sir.
  


         xxx     xxx     xxx     
  


Q.    Did you see anything unusual when you look(ed) out the window?
  


A.     Yes, sir.
  


Q.    Will you please tell the Court              what is that unusual thing that you saw?
  


A.     I saw a person alighted (sic) from the jeep, sir.
  


Q.    But where is that jeep that you have just mentioned?
  


A.     In front of our window, sir.
  


Q.    And when you said you saw a person came down the jeep, what did you do next?
  


A.     I shouted at him, sir.
  


Q.    What did you shout at him?
  


A.     I said âHoyâ and asked âAno yan,â sir. 


Q.    When you said that, what did that man do?
  


A.     He look(ed) at me and run (sic) away, sir.
  


xxx      xxx     xxx
  


Q.    Now, you said that after looking up to you and suddenly he run away, what did you do next?
  


A.     I go (sic) downstairs, sir.
  


Q.    Where downstairs did you go, what portion?
  


A.     Outside our door, sir.
  


Q.    After going outside your door, what did you see, if any?
  


A.    I saw my son lying (sic) prostrate outside our door, sir.
[5]






On cross-examination, Ana Paulinâs testimony reveals:



Q.    Mrs. Witness, you did not actually saw (sic) the stabbing?
  


A.    No, sir.
[6]






Furthermore, Ana Paulinâs testimony fails to state whether the man 
she saw was carrying a weapon, or whether he was bloodied or not. 
Indeed, there is an absence of positive proof that accused-appellant 
assaulted the victim. 

Likewise, Dr. Jose Lopez, Jr., the medico-legal officer who performed the autopsy, testified:



Q.    Doctor, you said that the wounds found on the body of the 
victim Roberto Pineda are (sic) cause(d) by a sharp bladed instrument?
  


A.     Yes, sir.
  


Q.    But it is also possible that the wounds could have been caused by more than one sharp bladed instrument?
  


A.     Yes, sir.
  


Q.    So, it is also possible that there were (sic) more than one assailant?
  


Atty. Paler. Incompetent, your honor.
  


Court.                          The doctor said that it could be 
possible that the wounds could have been also caused by more than one 
instrument.
  


Atty. Agosila.           Yes, your Honor, and my next question is 
whether it is also possible that there were (sic) more than one 
assailant?
  


Court.                          Witness may answer.
  


A.    Yes, sir.
[7]






This admission raises serious doubts as to the credibility of the 
prosecutionâs theory that accused-appellant was the victimâs sole 
assailant.

As to accused-appellantâs motive, it is true that the latter did 
have a motive to kill Roberto Pineda. Yet, in order to support a 
conviction, motive must be coupled with evidence from which it may be 
reasonably deduced that the accused-appellant was the malefactor.
[8]

 Given the paucity of evidence in the instant case, to conclude that the
 killing arose from the previous altercation between accused-appellant 
and the victim would be more speculative than factual. The court cannot 
rely on mere presumptions and conjectures to convict the 
accused-appellant. While his alibi is rather weak, this is no reason for
 us to sustain his conviction, as the burden of proof still lies with 
the prosecution to establish that accused-appellant killed the victim. 
Thus, this Court, in 
Peo. vs. Manansala
[9]
 held that:



âTrial courts must keep in mind that the prosecution must be able 
to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence beyond a 
reasonable doubt to justify the conviction of the accused. The 
prosecution must stand or fall on its own evidence; it cannot draw 
strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.â
  




In the instant case, the totality of evidence adduced by the 
prosecution cannot be considered as constituting an unbroken chain 
leading to the fair and reasonable conclusion that accused-appellant is 
guilty of the crime charged. The circumstances proffered by the 
prosecution only go so far as to create a suspicion that the accused 
probably perpetrated the crime charged. But suspicion alone is 
insufficient, the required quantum of evidence being proof beyond 
reasonable doubt. We quote, with emphasis, the saying that âThe sea of 
suspicion has no shore, and the court that embarks upon it is without 
rudder or compass.â
[10]


In sum, if a life is taken, justice demands that the wrong be 
redressed, but this justice that calls for retribution cannot be the 
same one that would convict accused-appellant at bar whose guilt has not
 been proven beyond reasonable doubt.
[11]


WHEREFORE
, the appeal is hereby GRANTED and the 
decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 12565 dated March 31, 
1995, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-appellant Ariston A. Abad is 
hereby ACQUITTED on ground of reasonable doubt. Accordingly, let the 
accused be immediately released from his place of confinement unless 
there is reason to detain him further for any other legal or valid 
cause. No pronouncement as to costs.
