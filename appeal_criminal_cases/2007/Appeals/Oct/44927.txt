Pacencia Salumayag, the neighbor of AAA, narrated what occurred on the
morning of the next day.  She stated that on the morning of 21 October
1998, at 7 oâclock, AAA went to her house; that she observed AAA to be
afraid of something; that upon further prodding, AAA asked her to
accompany the former to the house of Vivian Silvano to ask him to go
along with them to see the 
Punong Barangay
;
and that after entrusting AAA to the Punong Barangay, she went home.
 During cross-examination, the defense counsel elicited from the
witness the statement that though she and accused-appellant were also
neighbors, she actually did not like him; that when AAA went to see
her, the former was crying.  When asked on redirect examination if AAA
had identified the person who allegedly committed the rape, the witness
answered in the affirmative and proceeded to name accused-appellant as
the perpetrator of the crime.


Cesar Villacencio, the 
Punong Barangay
 of 
Barangay

XXX, Municipality of YYY, Province of ZZZ, testified that, on 21
October 1998, around 7:30 in the morning, AAA, accompanied by Pacencia
Salumayag and Vivian Silvano, reported to him the alleged rape that
occurred the previous evening.  In particular, he narrated that AAA
identified her rapist to be Conrado Baranggan 
y
 Generalao, a resident of the same 
barangay
; that he later summoned accused Baranggan to the 
Barangay

Hall in order to fully investigate the alleged crime; and that he later
turned over the suspect to the police due to the seriousness of the
matter.  On cross-examination, said witness further testified the
behavior and appearance of AAA â that she was crying and appeared to be
weak.

To further make out a case for the crime of rape, the prosecution
presented Dr. Cabrera, Municipal Health Officer and Rural Health
Physician, Rural Health Unit and Family Planning Center, WWW, ZZZ.  Dr.
Cabrera gave evidence as to the injuries sustained by AAA as a result
of her alleged rape on the night of 20 October 1998.  He testified that
on 21 October 1998, around 6 oâclock in the evening, the police brought
AAA to his clinic to be examined by him; that he performed a medical
examination on the person of AAA and thereafter,  issued a Medical
Certificate to attest to his findings.  According to his testimony, his
physical examination of AAA yielded the following findings: though the
labia majora showed no physical signs of injury, there was a whitish
mucoid discharge at its opening; on the inside of AAAâs vagina,
however, there was evidence of recent penetration by a hard and blunt
object -- the hymen displayed a laceration or tearing at the 3 oâclock
position, as well as abrasions with blood clot at the 6 oâclock
position; and that the whitish mucoid discharge was seminal fluid. Dr.
Cabrera then concluded that the injuries sustained by AAAâs private
part were the result of âsexual completion or sexual penetration.â
[16]
  On cross-examination, Dr. Cabrera testified that he found no sign of physical injury on any other part of AAAâs body.


EEE, the older sister of AAA, was presented last to establish merely the date of birth and age of the latter.

When the time came for the defense to controvert the evidence of the
prosecution, a different version was laid out.  Diametrically opposed
to the version of the prosecution, accused-appellant did not deny that
he had sexual intercourse with AAA.  He claimed, however, that his
sexual relations with the victim was consensual, they being
sweethearts.  He related that what occurred on the night of 20 October
1998 was a planned assignation between them.  Particularly, he stated
that â

It calls for opinion.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atty. Moleta: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your honor please, the accused in this case has personal knowledge why the same was not locked, your honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Court:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The witness testified that he was supposed to knock the door, there was no such agreement, there is no basis.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atty. Moleta: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We believe, your honor, that this witness may have personal knowledge as to why the door was not locked.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Court: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no testimony to that effect previously. As matter of fact he said that when nobody opened the door, he just pushed it.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atty. Moleta: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We will reform the question.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
Mr. Baranggan, do you have any personal knowledge why the door of the house of the private complainant is not locked when you have gone to the house of the private complainant in the evening of October 20, 1998?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pros. Villaces: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Already submitted, your honor.

A:         
 
At about 9:30 oâclock more or less.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
And when you opened the door, we may know who was the persons present inside?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
Only the two of them.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:

A:         
 
They were asleep.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
We may know how did they position while they were sleeping?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
There were sleeping with their arms across their chest.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
Were they sleeping together or lying together?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
They were lying together side by side.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
We may know how far were they from each other?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
Very near, sir, about one foot distance.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
Were they using a mat?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
Yes, sir, singular size.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
How big is this single size mat?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
More than a meter wide and the distance from each other is less than a meter.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
When you opened the door of the house of the private complainant, we may know what happened next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
I touched her leg in order to awaken her?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
We may know if she got awake?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She stood up.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Court: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(to the witness)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
Who stood up?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
AAA, your honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atty. Moleta:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
We may know what did she say when she stood up?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She said, âyou are here?â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
What was your answer?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
I said, âI have not forgotten our agreement thatâs why Iâm here.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
We may know what happened next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
I asked her âwhat about my request?â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
We may know what was her response?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She said âyou really abided with our agreement.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
And we may know what happened next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
I placed my arms around her shoulder.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
We may know what was her position when you placed your arm around in her shoulder?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
We were facing each other seated and placed my arm around her shoulder.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
And we may know what happened next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
So I kissed her because at that time I was already craving for sex.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
Before you kissed the private complainant in this case, we may know if you have a conversation with her?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
A little conversation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
What was you conversation about?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
Regarding the life of the widower and I told her that I wanted a companion.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
After you kissed the private complainant in this case, we may know what happened next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
After kissing her on her face including her neck, I placed a kissed mark on her neck, and she said, âdonât do it in my neck because it is noticeable.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
When you kissed the private complainant in this case, we may know what was her reaction?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She had no reaction. She just let me kissed her and she even stretched her neck.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
After that what happened next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
Since she does not want that a kissed mark be placed on her neck then I asked her, âwhere will I place the kissed mark.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
And what was her answer?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She said âin the hidden part.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
And then we may know what happened next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
And so I placed the kissed mark on her left breast.  She even opened her blouse so I placed a kissed mark.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
After kissing the private complainant in this case and after she opened her blouse, we may know where was her sister at that time?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She was there sleeping.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
How come that while you were kissing with the private complainant in this case, her sister BBB was not able to awaken?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pros. Villaces: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It calls for opinion, your honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Court: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sustained.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atty. Moleta:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
Mr. Baranggan, you are aware of the presence of BBB, the sister of the private complainant, when you kissed the private complainant?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pros. Villaces: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Leading, your honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atty. Moleta:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
How did you kiss the private complainant that was not awakened the sister, BBB?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pros. Villaces: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We object, your honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Court: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The witness may answer.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
Very silent.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atty. Moleta:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
And after the private complainant in this case opened her blouse, we may know what happened next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
When she opened her blouse, I embraced her and then I romanced with her on her breast and on her body/
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
Then after that what happened?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
Then we laid down side by side. I requested her that I be allowed to perform the private act.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
And what was her response to your request, if there was any?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
And she said, âyou want to use me when I still have my underwear.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
Whose underwear the private complainant are you referring to?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
Her underwear.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
So, what did you do?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
After removing her underwear, I romanced with her, I kissed her private parts.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
We may know who took her panty?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She was the one who removed her underwear.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
What have you observed with her companion BBB?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She was not yet awakened at that time.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
After that we may know what happened?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
After romancing her breast and her private parts, she held my head and then I kissed again her face.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
After that what happened?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
After that we had sexual intercourse.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
While you were already having sexual act with the private complainant, we may know what have you observed from her?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
Since I am a man, I asked her âwhy are you not a virgin anymore as if you have already delivered a child.â  That was really I asked her.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Court: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(to the witness)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
What did she answer?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She said âyou have nothing to do with that.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atty. Moleta:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
We may know what have you observed from her bodily reaction when you had a sexual intercourse with her?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
That she was not a virgin.  After a while she wrapped her legs around my waist and that was the time that BBB was able to wake up.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
Can you point to BBB if she is present in this courtroom?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
BBB is not here.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
Was there a noise created when the private complainantâ¦ I will reform the question, you honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Why did you say that BBB was able to wake up?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She was already woke up because she asked â
Ate
, who is your companion?â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
When BBB said 
ate
 to whom was she referring to?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
Ate
 AAA.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:        
 
We may know what was the answer or reaction of AAA?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:         
 
She said âkeep quiet just go to sleep.â  She even covered her face with a blanket.
[17]
 
 
 
BBB was presented as a hostile witness considering that she is the
younger sister of AAA.  During her testimony, BBB stated that on the
date and time of the incident in question, she was inside their home â
a one-room nipa structure â and was asleep on top of a mat on the
floor; that she slept beside her â
ate
â;
that they each had their own blanket; that during the night of the date
in question, she woke up, as she had the urge to urinate, and she
called out to her â
ate
â but
the latter told her to keep quiet; that she fell asleep again without
going to the bathroom; and that the following morning, her â
ate
â told her that during the night, the former was raped by accused-appellant.

Joseph Baranggan, son of accused-appellant, was the third and last
witness presented by the defense.  During his direct examination, the
witness testified that he knew the sisters AAA and BBB, for they were
his neighbors; considering the proximity of their houses, the witness
knew for a fact that the sisters were used to going out and returning
well into the night; and that AAA was fond of male company and was
actually the talk of the town.


After trial, on 25 March 2002, the RTC promulgated its Judgment, the dispositive portion of which states:


Wherefore, premises considered, the Court finds the
accused, Conrado Generalao Baranggan, guilty beyond reasonable doubt as
a principal of the crime of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph (1),
(a), of the Revised Penal Code, with the aggravating circumstance of
dwelling, and hereby sentences him to reclusion perpetua and its
accessory penalties; and to pay the costs.


The accused is ordered to pay to the victim, AAA, the sum of 
P
50,000.00 as civil indemnity and the further sum of 
P
50,000.00 as moral damages.
[18]



In adjudging accused-appellant guilty of the crime charged, the RTC
gave credence to the evidence of the prosecution and declared that:

Since it was admitted that the accused engaged in sexual
intercourse with the complainant, the burden lay upon him to prove by
clear and convincing proof that it was with her consent. This (sic) the
accused failed to do to the satisfaction of the court.


x x x x

[E]ven assuming arguendo that the complainant had lovers and was no
longer a virgin, this gave no license to the accused to force himself
on a defenseless girl. The victim who was only fifteen years old was
not shown to possess the shrewdness and callousness to concoct a story
of rape. AAA appeared to be a simple country girl who would not endure
physical examination and public trial if her story were untrue. She had
absolutely no motive to testify falsely against the accused. Her
testimony is entitled to full faith and credence (citation omitted).
[19]



And in the end concluded that:


It was satisfactorily established that the accused had
carnal knowledge of his victim by means of force and intimidation and
without the latterâs consent.
[20]


On 2 May 2002, accused-appellant seasonably filed a Notice of Appeal
[21]
 before the RTC. Conformably with 
People v. Mateo
,
[22]
 however, in a Resolution dated 20 September 2004,
[23]
 we directed the transfer of this case to the Court of Appeals for intermediate review.


Affirming 
in toto

the judgment of the RTC, the Court of Appeals confirmed
accused-appellantâs conviction in a Decision dated 30 June 2006, in
CA-G.R. CR. HC. No. 00198-MIN.  The 
fallo
 of the Court of Appeals decision reads:


WHEREFORE, all the foregoing considered, the appeal is
hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit and the assailed Decision is hereby
AFFIRMED 
in toto
.
[24]


The present case is again before us for our final disposition.

Accused-appellant is still seeking the reversal of the decision of the
RTC, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, finding him guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of rape on the lone assignment of error
stating:

THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE.
[25]
Essentially,
it is his contention that the evidence presented by the prosecution was
not sufficient to establish the existence of the crime of rape.  In his
Brief, he avers that AAAâs accusation of rape, 
vis-Ã -vis

her lack of physical injuries and her reputation, do not establish
occurrence of the crime of rape.  Accused-appellant maintains the
defense that the sexual intercourse that occurred on the date and time
in question was a tryst between sweethearts.  It is then his conclusion
that the absence of external evidence of physical injuries on AAAâs
person, the latterâs loose morals or naughty reputation, in addition to
the fact that they had a thing going between them, all point to
reasonable doubt respecting his legal culpability of the crime charged.
 And there being reasonable doubt, his constitutionally guaranteed
right to be presumed innocent was not overcome.


On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), for the 
People of the Philippines
,
asserts that accused-appellantâs claim of the âsweetheart defenseâ is
tenuous at best.  Having failed to present corroborating evidence to
support such assertion, the claim was self-serving and merely an
afterthought or a âdesperate attempt to extricate himself from the bind
brought about by his unmitigated lust towards an innocent and
practically orphaned child.â
[26]

 Respecting the claim of lack of external signs of physical injuries,
the OSG avers that â[w]hether the victim suffered external injuries
other than the violation done to her private parts is immaterial where
the medical report proves that she sustained the injury which under the
law qualifies as rape.â
[27]

 Moreover, it argues that even though BBB was also in the room when the
rape occurred, AAA could not call out to her for help, because
accused-appellant threatened to kill both AAA and BBB if she (AAA)
brought attention to what was going on.


We find no merit in the petition.


Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, defines and punishes the crime of rape, 
viz
:


Art. 266-A. 
Rape; When and How Committed.
 â Rape is committed: â


1) By a man who have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: 
a) Through force, threat or intimidation; 
b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; 
c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and
d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is
demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be
present.

The crime of rape is penalized by a sentence of 
reclusion perpetua
 under the terms of Article 266-B of the same law:


Art. 266-B. 
Penalties
. â Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.

In the case at bar, having weighed the evidence for the contending
parties, we find no cogent reason to reverse the findings and
conclusion of the RTC, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  From a
painstaking and meticulous review of the records, we find, and so hold,
that the crime of rape was committed on the person of AAA, and that
accused-appellant was the perpetrator of the crime that he had been
charged with and convicted of.

From the quoted provisions of Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised
Penal Code, for conviction in the crime of rape, the following elements
must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: 1) that the accused had carnal
knowledge of the victim; and 2) that said act was accomplished (a)
through the use of force or intimidation, or (b) when the victim is
deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or (c) when the victim is
twelve years of age or is demented.


Basic is the principle in criminal law that the evidence presented must be sufficient to prove the 
corpus delicti
 â the body or substance of the crime; and, in its primary sense, refers to the fact that a crime has been actually committed.
[28]
  The 
corpus delicti
 is a compound fact composed of two things: 1) the existence of a certain act or 
result
 forming the basis of the criminal charge; and 2) the existence of a criminal agency as the cause of this act or result.
[29]

 In all criminal prosecutions, the burden is on the prosecution to
prove the body or substance of the crime.  In the case at bar,
accused-appellant himself does not deny that he had sexual intercourse
with AAA.  His contention, however, is that his carnal knowledge of the
victim on the date and time in question did not amount to the crime of
rape because such coitus was consensual.  The foregoing being an
affirmative defense, accused-appellant now has the burden of proving
the claim of consent to the sexual act.

The evidence presented by the prosecution â the testimony of AAA that
accused-appellant raped her, coupled with the testimony of Dr. Cabrera
narrating that the medical examination he conducted on AAA and the
result of such examination attesting to her injuries were consistent
with the penetration of the vagina by a hard object â added to the
admission by accused-appellant that he had sexual intercourse with AAA,
fully buttresses the existence of the crime of rape.  The burden of
proof having shifted to accused-appellant, was he able to prove the
non-existence of the two components of the 
corpus delicti
?

In his defense, accused-appellant advances the so-called âsweetheart
theory.â He admits the sexual encounter, but avers that it was
consensual because of his alleged relationship with the victim.  He
bolsters his claim of consent by pointing to AAAâs lack of external
physical injuries along with her loose morals or naughty reputation.

The âsweetheart theoryâ or âsweetheart defenseâ is an oft abused
justification that rashly derides the intelligence of this Court and
sorely tests our patience.
[30]

 By asserting the existence of such a relationship, accused-appellant
seeks to prove that AAA willingly participated in the sexual act. But
she did not.  Accused-appellant is but a neighbor.  From the testimony
of AAA, he was nothing more than an acquaintance.  Therefore, contrary
to his claim that such familiarity explains the mutual attraction that
was spawned in a dayâs time, this Courtâs estimation is that if at all
there was attraction, it was merely one-sided â from his end.  Absent
any other tangible and concrete evidence of a relationship beyond
acquaintanceship or neighborly relations, we cannot give credence to
accused-appellantâs self-serving claim of intimate association between
him and AAA that would validate the sexual intercourse that occurred on
the date and time in question.

And even if it were true that they were sweethearts, a love affair does
not justify rape, for the beloved cannot be sexually violated against
her will.
[31]
  A man does not have an unbridled license to subject his beloved to his carnal desires.
[32]


In his Brief, accused-appellant wants us to open our minds to the 
possibility

of a one-day courtship that led to an irrepressible attraction and
culminated in a late night tryst.  Other than surmise and conjecture,
nothing substantial or corporeal has been put forward by him.  Lest it
be forgotten, surmises and conjectures have no place in a judicial
inquiry and are especially anathema in a criminal prosecution.
[33]

 In a criminal prosecution, a reasonable doubt can be created by many
things; but to be sufficient to prevent conviction, it must arise from
the evidence adduced or from the lack of evidence, and can arise from
no other legitimate source.
[34]
 Absolute certainty is not demanded by law to convict an accused of any
criminal charge; but quite surely, mere possibility is not the type of
evidence that will amount to a speck of reasonable doubt that will
engender an acquittal. In the instant case, accused-appellantâs
assertion that due to the long standing familiarity between him and
AAA, the one-day courtship during their chance encounter at the spring
was possible.  But that was just it â only a possibility.

Anent accused-appellantâs argument concerning the absence of external
physical injuries on the person of AAA, suffice it to say that the
absence of physical injuries on AAAâs body does not, of itself, negate
the latterâs testimony of rape, nor does it make her a willing partner
in the sexual act in the case at bar.  This Court is satisfied that the
evidence elicited from Dr. Cabrera 
apropos
 the laceration and abrasion sustained by AAA on her hymen is consistent with a very recent sexual intercourse.


The force used in the commission of rape need not be overpowering or absolutely irresistible.
[35]
  What is essential is simply that the force employed was sufficient to
enable the offender to consummate the lewd purpose which the offender
had in mind. In this case, there is no question that accused-appellant
succeeded in his brutish objective.  The threat made on the life of AAA
and her sister BBB, coupled with accused-appellantâs strength, was more
than enough to facilitate his bestial intentions.

Worth noting further is the fact that accused-appellant has not shown
any motive on the part of AAA, to accuse him falsely of the crime of
rape.  If accused-appellantâs defense was real â that AAA willingly
submitted to his embraces and voluntarily engaged in sexual intercourse
with him â it is very difficult for us to understand why AAA should,
without much ado or prevarication, rush to her neighbor to ask to be
accompanied to the 
Punong Barangay
,
crying that accused-appellant violated her.  We agree with the RTC that
it is quite unreal to suppose that AAA, a young country lass, with no
apparent reason to bear false witness against accused-appellant, would
tell such a nauseating story, seek police assistance, endure the
humiliation of having someone examine her privates, and go through the
rigors of a public trial, if indeed she had not been raped.


As to accused-appellantâs civil liability, the RTC correctly awarded to AAA 
P
50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and 
P
50,000.00
as moral damages, but failed to award exemplary damages.  Given the
presence of the aggravating circumstance of dwelling, and in line with
current jurisprudence, the additional award of 
P
25,000.00 to AAA as exemplary damages is appropriate.

In fine, the above-quoted excerpts from AAAâs account of the rape that
occurred on the night of 20 October 1998 is plain and forthright.  The
RTC, which had the exclusive opportunity to assess the truthfulness of
her narration, was thoroughly convinced of her credibility.  Let it be
stated again that we have consistently deferred to the findings and
conclusions made by a trial judge, principally because it is the latter
who gets the opportunity to directly and intimately observe the
witnesses and to determine, by their demeanor on the witness stand, the
probative strength or weakness of what they declared.  It must be
stressed further that this case has previously undergone intermediate
review by the Court of Appeals, which reached the same conclusion as
the RTC. Our own thorough examination of the records necessitates us to
concur.
