ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.
[3]
When arraigned for both counts on 17 August 1999, appellant, with the assistance of his counsel, pleaded not guilty.
[4]
The prosecution and the defense admitted the following in the joint pre-trial:
 Identity of the accused in both cases is admitted;
 That accused Juan CariÃ±aga is the legal husband of 
Vetelina Bataller
;
[5]
 That the accused Juan CariÃ±aga is the legitimate father of the victim, AAA;
 That AAA, the victim[,] was born on November 23, 1987 as appearing in the birth certificate.
[6]
Thereafter, trial commenced. The prosecution presented four witnesses: (1) the victim AAA; (2) AAA's younger sister and appellant's daughter, 
Belinda CariÃ±aga
; (3) AAA's mother and appellant's wife, 
Vetelina CariÃ±aga
; and (4) Dr. Lea Remonte, municipal health officer of Ligao, Albay, who conducted the medical examination on AAA.
In its Consolidated Decision, the trial court summarized the prosecution's version of the incident as follows:
AAA, 12 years old, a Grade VI pupil and a resident of 
Bonga, Ligao, Albay
, testified she was born on November 23, 1987. Her father is Juan CariÃ±aga, the accused, and her mother is 
Vetelina CariÃ±aga
. They are five (5)
 
in the family. She is the eldest, next is 
Belinda
, then 
Nelson
, 
Raymart
, and 
Joanne
, the youngest. On November 23, 1998 at about 4:00 o'clock in the morning, her mother and father left for the Poblacion of Ligao, Albay to go to the market. After her parents left, she slept again. While she was already sleeping at about 5:00 o'clock her father came back and opened the main door. Their house has no room and at that time she was sleeping on one side of the house. After opening the door, her father put out the fluorescent lamp and pulled down her shorts and panty. Her father also removed his shorts and his brief[s] then laid on top of her. He opened her thighs and applied saliva on her vagina. He attempted to insert his penis inside her vagina but was able to put only the half of it inside. When her father tried to insert his penis she felt pain and pushed him away. Later she felt something slimy and noticed sticky substance on her thighs and vagina. Her father then removed his shirt and wiped her vagina with it and told her not to tell her mother or he will kill them all. After that her father left. Her mother returned home that day but she did not tell her or anybody of what happened because of fear.
On December 15
, 
1998 at about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon she was outside their house playing with 
Belinda
 together with her other siblings. The nearest house to their house is about 9 to 10 meters [away]. Then her father who was inside their house called her. She and her youngest sister who was then 2 years old went inside the house leaving the others behind outside. Her youngest sister was already walking then. Inside the house her father told her to lie down but she told him she will move her bowel but her father did not let her go. Then her father removed her shorts and panty and he also removed his shorts and brief[s] and then laid on top of her. Again he tried to insert his penis inside her vagina but half of his penis entered. After inserting his penis his [sic] father tried to press it down while his body was moving up and down. Her father remained on top for sometime. After that her father used his white shirt and wiped her vagina. At that time her mother was in the Poblacion of Ligao, selling vegetables in the market stall. Her mother that December 15
, 
1998 [sic], arrived already in the evening but she did not tell her again what happened to her. Her sister, 
Belinda
, told her mother, that she was raped. And when her mother asked her if she was raped she answered she was. Then her mother brought her to the Poblacion at the Police Station to report the incident. When both incidents happened she was in Grade Five.
On cross-examination, AAA describing their sleeping arrangement in their house testified that on her right was the wall and [to] her left was 
Belinda
, next, to 
Belinda
 was 
Nelson
, 
Raymart
, 
Joanne
 and next to 
Joanne
 was her mother. All sleep on the floor. When her father came back her father slept near 
Joanne
 and when she woke up her father was still sleeping beside 
Joanne
. After waking up at 5:30 she cooked then their youngest brother also woke up. She admitted she had a peaceful sleep.
Cross-examined on the December 15, 1998 incident AAA testified that in the afternoon at about 5:00 o'clock she was at their neighbor's place playing with Roda. Roda is 13 years old and is the daughter of her mother's brother. Noise in their house can be heard at Roda's parents' house and at that time Roda's parents were in their house. She went home with 
Joanne
 at 4:00 p.m. and her father was in the house sleeping. Inside the house she cooked and after she was finished cooking her father called her. Her other brother and sister were still outside then. After she went near her father, the latter told her to get inside the place they are sleeping and as told she went inside. Their house has a bedroom and a sala. Inside the bedroom her father told her to remove her shorts. She did not remove her shorts because she expected something again to happen. So, her father held her hand and pulled her. She did not shout because her siblings were outside and her father threatened her. Her brothers and sisters came home later and by 6:00 o'clock in the evening together with their father they ate their supper. Her mother arrived home at about 7:00 o'clock in the evening.
Giving a clearer account on redirect of the November 23, 1998 incident, AAA declared her father was to accompany her mother only up to her Aunt's (mother's sister) store which is far from their house. Her mother was the one to proceed to the market. When her father arrived she did not cook yet because it was still dark. What her father did upon arrival and entering the house was to put off the light and then moved her sibling next to her then removed her shorts and panty and laid on top of her. And then while on top [he] applied saliva on the vagina.
She can remember well what her father did on November 23, 1998 because that was her birthday. That time 
Nelson
 was about 9 years old and 
Raymart
 was 
5
years old. She did not shout because her sister was asleep. She cried when her father raped her but she was not able to cry out loud.
BELINDA CARIÃAGA
, 10 years old and Grade III pupil when she took the witness stand testified that the accused is her father. On November 23, 1998 at about 5:00 o'clock in the morning she was in their house at 
Bonga, Ligao, Albay
 cooking. Her Papa undressed and removed the shorts and panty of her Ate then parted her knees and laid on top of her. Her father held his penis and inserted it to her Ate's vagina. At that time their mother was in Oas, Albay selling. When she returned she told her mother what her father did and her mother cried.
On cross-examination, 
Belinda
 said she was in the kitchen cooking rice when her sister was raped by their father. Their bedroom to their kitchen is near. Ate pushed her father but did not shout. She (
Belinda
) also did not shout for help. Her mother came home about 5:00 in the afternoon while her father was gathering gourds. She reported to her mother that same day. After learning about it her mother went to the doctor. She did not confront her father about it. There are five 
(5) 
siblings in their family, three (3) girls and two (2) boys. The eldest is her ate. And in their house there is only one (1) room where all in the family sleep. 
Belinda
 declared she can recall that her Ate was raped by their father three (3) times. The second time she cannot recall but it was noon time. The third time she remembers was on December 
15, 
1998 at 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon. The second and third time her Ate was raped her siblings were with their grandmother.
VETELINA CARIÃAGA
, 32, married, housewife[,] of 
Bonga, Ligao, Albay
, testified she and the accused Juan CariÃ±aga are legally married (Exh. "A"). AAA, the eldest in the family is their daughter (Exh. "B"). Her daughter 
Belinda
 told her on a Friday, January 22, 1999 that her husband raped AAA. 
Belinda
 was crying when she told her about it. When she learned about it she felt she lost all her senses and [became] confused. The next thing she did was to dress AAA and brought her to Dr. Prelligera. The latter, however, suggested to bring AAA to the Municipal Health Office. Following Prelligera's advice she brought AAA to the Municipal Health Office where she was examined and after her examination she went to the police where she executed an affidavit and complaint.
On cross-examination, 
Vetelina
 admitted that prior to November 23, 1998 she and her husband had already a misunderstanding because the latter made "passes" at her sister 
Jeannie Bataller
.
DR. LEA REMONTE, Municipal Health Officer of Ligao, Albay testified that as a member of the municipality's Child Crises Management Unit which takes care of victims of rape and battered housewife, the PNP and DSWD made a request for her to conduct an examination on AAA. The latter was brought to her by the DSWD accompanied by the mother and an aunt. She found out during that examination that the offender was the patient's father, Juan CariÃ±aga. Her medical findings are contained in the medical certificate she issued (Exh. "C") to wit:
"External Examination:
-
Breast: flat, not yet developed, no signs of abrasions nor hematoma noted
-
Abdomen: flat, soft, no organomegaly, no signs ofabrasion nor hematomas noted.
-
Genitalia: Normal external genitalia, nulliparous introitus, absence of pubic hair over mons pubis
 
 
"Internal Examination:
-
labia minora slightly protruding beyond labia majora
-
prominent clitoris noted
-
 hymen not intact
-
absence of lacerations noted
-
 vagina admits small finger with ease and one half of the length of the forefinger
-
no discharge nor blood upon withdrawal of the examining fingers"
Explaining what could cause the conditions she noted on internal examination of the genitalia, Dr. Remonte mentioned several factors, namely, external manipulation or excessive physical exertion such as running or jumping, or falling on a hard object[,] and sexual intercourse.
[7]
The defense's sole witness was appellant Juan CariÃ±aga.
The Public Attorney summarized the defense's version as follows:
Accused 
Juan CariÃ±aga
 branded the charges that he raped her [sic] daughter AAA on November 23, 1998 and December 15, 1998 as pure fabrications. On November 23, 1998, he woke up early, around 3:00 to 4:00 o `clock in the morning, to accompany his wife to Centro, Poblacion, Ligao, Albay. On his way home, he fetched water for use at the house, then proceeded to tend to the plants. He went home only at around 11:00 in the morning.
On December 15, he was at Pandan, Ligao, Albay, together with his daughter AAA, at the invitation of his "compadre," the godfather of' AAA, Boy Gacad. They proceeded to the place after lunch and only returned home at past 8:00 o'clock p.m.
The accused surmised that the baseless fabrications may have been brought about by his wife's desire to get rid of him. Accordingly, 
Vitelina
 is having an affair with one Ariel Modestano and the two (2) were [sic] now living together at their residence.
The accused likewise branded the testimonies of his daughter[s], AAA and 
Benilda
, as tutored, they being instructed of what to say or declare in court.
[8]
On rebuttal, 
Vetelina CariÃ±aga
 testified that it was on the 25th and not on the 15th of December 1998 that appellant went with AAA to Boy Gacad's house. She also denied the existence of her alleged illicit relationship with Ariel Modestano.
[9]
 
Bonga
's Barangay Captain Edmundo Gomez, a sponsor during 
Vetelina
 and appellant's wedding, and 
Vetelina's
 employer Rosalie Cha, both testified that 
Vetelina
 is employed as a stay-in housemaid at Layon, Ligao, Albay.
[10]
The trial court rendered a judgment of conviction on 14 September 2000. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in both Criminal Cases Nos. 3836 & 3837 finding the accused Juan CariÃ±aga guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of rape committed against his 11-year old daughter AAA and accordingly hereby sentences him to suffer twice (2x) the penalty of death and to indemnify the offended party the total amount of P150,000.00 and to pay another amount of P100,000.00 by way of moral damages and to pay the costs.
Let the records of these cases together with all the exhibits and transcript of stenographic notes be immediately elevated to the Supreme Court for automatic review.
SO ORDERED.
[11]
In this automatic review, appellant makes a lone assignment of error:
THE COURT 
A QUO 
GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE DESPITE THE CLEAR INCONSISTENCIES IN THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PRINCIPAL WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION.
The appeal has no merit. We agree with the trial court that the prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt that appellant is guilty of the crime of rape.
First. 
The trial court found the testimony of the prosecution witnesses credible and straightforward. Appellant, on the other hand, cites the following circumstances to support his assertion that the trial court erred in giving credence to the prosecution evidence:
(a)
Belinda CariÃ±aga
, younger sister of AAA, could not have vividly seen the incident on 23 November 1998. 
Belinda
 testified that appellant first put out the fluorescent lamp in the room before having sexual intercourse with AAA;
 
(b)
Appellant could not have been so brazen in sexually abusing AAA while 
Belinda
 was cooking rice in another corner of the house;
 
(c)
Belinda
 testified that she informed her mother 
Vetelina
 about the rape incidents on the same days that they occurred, or on 23 November 1998 and 15 December 1998, respectively. However, 
Vetelina
 testified that she was informed of the incidents by 
Belinda
 on 22 January 1999; and
 
(d)
The physical evidence failed to show with moral certainty that appellant sexually abused AAA.
[12]
Appellant quibbles on impertinent matters. What is material is that the commission of rape by appellant against AAA is proven beyond any doubt. Discrepancies should refer to significant facts that are crucial to the guilt or innocence of an accused. Inconsistencies and discrepancies in details, which are irrelevant to the elements of the crime, are not grounds for acquittal.
[13]
 Nevertheless, we shall still discuss the matters appellant has raised.
It is not hard to believe that 
Belinda
, who was cooking rice in the kitchen, saw the rape incident at 5:00 in the early morning even if appellant put out the light in the room. This is just about the time when day breaks and darkness slowly fades to give way to light.
Belinda's
 testimony that there is also a kitchen in the house does not contradict AAA's testimony that their house has only one room. It appears that only a partition separates the kitchen from the main room where the family slept. It is not really another room which has a door or is enclosed.
[14]
 Thus, the circumstances of time and place do not affect the credibility of 
Belinda's
 eyewitness account. Rather, it corroborates AAA's account.
Appellant asserts that he could not have raped AAA in the presence of his other children. The presence of people has never deterred the commission of rape.
[15]
 Rape is not a respecter of people, time or place.
[16]
 Rape has been committed in places where people congregate, in parks, along roadsides, in school premises, in a house where there are other occupants, and even in places which to many would appear unlikely and high-risk venues for its commission. In any case, there is no rule that rape can be committed only in seclusion.
[17]
During the first incident, appellant timed his criminal act when it was still early morning. His wife had left the house and his brood of young children was still asleep, with the exception of 
Belinda
 whom he probably did not know was already awake.
The alleged contradiction between the testimonies of 
Belinda
 and her mother, as to when the former disclosed to the latter the rape incidents appellant committed against AAA, is more apparent than real. Allowance must be given to some minor lapses or ambiguity in 
Belinda's
 testimony on the matter, as she was only ten years old when she testified in court. A reading of her entire testimony would show that immediately after 
Belinda
 told her mother about the rape incidents, her mother brought AAA to the doctor.
[18]
 Her mother stated that 
Belinda
 made the disclosure on 22 January 1999. After hearing 
Belinda's
 disclosure, her mother brought AAA to the doctor. Then her mother brought AAA to the police station to file a complaint against appellant.
[19]
In any case, the alleged contradiction refers only to a minor matter that does not overrule the commission by appellant of the crime charged. 
Belinda's
 testimony is merely corroborative. AAA's own testimony by itself is strong, convincing and credible, and thus suffices to sustain appellant's conviction.
Finally, appellant argues that the medical findings showing AAA's hymen is no longer intact does not conclusively establish that it was due to sexual intercourse. He cites Dr. Lea Remonte's testimony that the rupture of the hymen could be caused by external manipulation, excessive physical exertion, running, or jumping, aside from sexual intercourse.
[20]
The other factors mentioned by the doctor do not exclude AAA's ruptured hymen as physical evidence of the sexual assault on her.
[21]
 When the victim's testimony of her sexual violation is corroborated by the physician's findings of penetration, i.e. a ruptured hymen, there is sufficient basis to conclude the existence of the essential requisite of carnal knowledge.
[22]
The trial court's evaluation of the testimony of a witness is accorded highest respect because the trial court had the direct and singular opportunity to observe the facial expression, gesture, and tone of voice of a witness while testifying. The trial court is uniquely positioned to determine whether a witness is telling the truth. We find no basis to deviate from the settled rule that the testimony of a rape victim of tender or immature age deserves full credit, as in this case where the facts establish the sexual assault on her.
[23]
 The testimony given was simple and straightforward, unshaken by a rigid cross-examination and unflawed by any inconsistency or contradiction. The same must be given full faith and credit.
[24]
 AAA testified thus:

My vagina.
 
 
Q
Now, after, where was your mother at that time when your father, according to you, raped you last December 15,
 
1998? At more or less, 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon?
A
She was in the store.
 
 
 
xxx
 
 
Q
x x x Did you not tell your mother what your father did to you at 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day?
A
No, sir because I was afraid.
 
 
 
xxx
 
 
COURT
 
Why did you in particular remember the first time your father abused you on November 23?
A
I cannot forget that date.
 
 
Q
Aside from the fact that it was the day you were first sexually abused why do you remember that it was November 23 and not on some other dates in November?
A
Because, it was my birthday.
[25]
AAA's claim that she was raped is corroborated by the medical findings of Dr. Lea Remonte, the physician who examined her. Dr. Remonte testified:
Q
Then, Genitalia: normal external genitalia, nulliparous, introitus, absence of pubic hair over mons pubis. What do you mean by this?
A
It means that externally there are no abnormalities. Normal external genitalia. The mons pubis or mons veneris is another term for that. Nulliparous introitus, meaning, that particular genitalia has not given birth yet. Absence of pubic hair, no pubic hair.
 
 
Q
In your Internal Examination, there is stated here: labia minora slightly protruding beyond labia majora. What do you mean by this?
A
Normally, the labia minora is covered by the labia majora. Labia majora in layman's term [are] the outer lip[s] and the labia minora [are] the inner lip[s]. Normal in virgin or those who have not given birth yet, they are in close position. Meaning, the labia minora is covered by the labia majora.
 
 
Q
With this [sic] findings considering that you stated labia minora is slightly protruding, what could have been the cause of that?
A
There are several causes. One of these is external manipulation, or excessive physical exertion, running or jumping, falling [on] a hard object, that could also rupture the hymen.
 
 
Q
How about sexual intercourse?
A
That could also be.
 
 
Q
Prominent clitoris noted. What do you mean by this?
A
Normally, it is covered by both labia but in this case, it is slightly prominent. Meaning, it is exposed.
 
 
Q
Now, there is a finding here, hymen not intact. What do you mean by this?
A
Meaning, the thin covering of the vaginal orifice has already been removed. Absolutely removed.
 
 
Q
Do you mean the covering itself was already removed? What could have been the cause for the removal of that?
A
Sexual intercourse is one and then the previous factors that I have mentioned a while ago.
 
 
Q
How about this absence of lacerations noted? What do you mean by this?
A
Although hymen is not intact, yet I was not able to see or to locate any laceration in the vaginal orifice.
 
 
Q
Do you mean, no hymenal laceration?
A
No.
 
 
Q
Now, ordinarily when the hymen is penetrated by, let us say penis, it is usually lacerated or ruptured, something like that. Now, in your findings, labia minora is slightly protruding, you gave us the opinion that sexual intercourse is a possible factor, is it not?
A
Yes, sir.
 
 
Q
Now, if there is no hymenal laceration, it would not necessarily mean that there is no penetration in the hymen of any matter?
A
Even if there is sexual intercourse, yet there is no laceration or there is no rupture of the hymen, it is because not all hymens are delicate. There are hymens which are elastic or extensible [sic] that even after several child bearing episodes, yet the hymen is still intact.
 
 
Q
Now, vagina admits small finger with ease and one-half of the length of the forefinger. What do you mean by this?
A
Meaning, the usual examining fingers are the forefinger and the middle finger. But since this is a child, I started with the small finger. But when I examined the child, this finger was able to penetrate. Now, I again tried the forefinger and this went in. One-half of this length went it.
 
 
Q
No discharge or blood upon withdrawal of the examining fingers. What do you mean by this?
A
In terms of, there are traumatic penetration wherein, like for example, instrumentation that will cause the bleeding inside the vagina. But in this case, there was no discharge nor bleeding noted upon withdrawal of the examining finger.
[26]
Appellant's trite defenses of alibi and denial cannot prevail over the positive and categorical statements of AAA. Alibi is often viewed with suspicion and received with caution not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but also because it is easy to fabricate. For the defense of alibi to prosper, it must be convincing to preclude any doubt on the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the 
locus criminis 
at the time of the incident.
[27]
 Other than his self-serving testimony, appellant did not present evidence to corroborate his alibi and denial. Self-serving declarations are inadmissible as evidence of the facts asserted.
[28]
Appellant's desperation to save himself is highlighted by his explanation as to why his wife caused the rape charges to be filed against him. Appellant alleged that his wife was having an extramarital affair. Even if it was not necessary, 
Vetelina
 chose to present witnesses to proved that appellant's allegations were untrue. Not a few persons convicted of rape have attributed the charges against them to family feuds, resentment, or revenge. However, such alleged motives have never swayed us from lending full credence to the testimony of a complainant who remained steadfast throughout her direct and cross-examination.
[29]
 It is unnatural for a parent to use her offspring as an instrument of malice, especially if it will subject them to embarrassment and even stigma.
[30]
 No mother in her right mind would expose her daughter to the disgrace and trauma resulting from a prosecution for rape if she was not genuinely motivated by a desire to incarcerate the person responsible for her daughter's defilement.
[31]
Second. 
The qualified rape of an underage relative for which appellant was charged is classified as a heinous crime and penalized under ArticIes 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353,
[32]
 as follows:
Article 266-A. 
Rape. When and How Committed. 
-Rape is committed -
1)
By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
 
 
 
a) Through force, threat or intimidation;
 
 
 
xxx
 
 
 
d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age x x x.
 
 
 
Article 266-B. 
Penalties. 
- Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua.
 
 
 
xxx
 
 
 
The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:
 
 
 
1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim;
 
 
 
x x x.
For simple rape under Article 266-A(l)(a), the prosecution must allege and prove appellant's carnal knowledge of a woman by force, threat, or intimidation. To qualify rape so as to warrant the death penalty, it must also be alleged and proved that the victim was under 18 years of age at the time of the rape and that the offender is a parent of the victim. All these elements are undisputedly present in this case.
Carnal knowledge is consummated by the mere touching of the woman's labia of the pudendum by the male sex organ.
[33]
 It is proven by two details: pain in the victim's genitalia and the findings of the medico-legal officer.
[34]
 The pain in the victim's private part could only be caused by the penetration, albeit slight, of the male organ into its opening.
[35]
 In this case, AAA's testimony of her sexual violation was corroborated by the physician's findings of penetration. Thus, there is sufficient basis to conclude the existence of the essential requisite of carnal knowledge.
[36]
In the present case, the testimony of AAA shows that appellant employed force and intimidation on her. Indeed, in the first incident of rape, there was a physical struggle as AAA "was pushing appellant away"
[37]
 as appellant was trying to insert his penis into her vagina. Appellant even warned AAA not to tell her mother, or else he would "kill them all."
[38]
 In the second incident of rape, AAA tried to escape from her father's clutches by putting up the excuse that she had to move her bowels,
[39]
 but to no avail.
AAA's correct age has been overlooked in the preparation of the Information. Both Informations stated that AAA was 12 years old at the time of the two rape incidents. However, the prosecution and the defense agreed during the pre-trial,
[40]
 and it was later proven during the trial,
[41]
 that AAA's date of birth is 23 November 1987. The obvious conclusion is that AAA was only 11 years old when she was rape on 23 November 1998 and 15 December 1998. Nevertheless, the prosecution proved that AAA was under 18 years of age at the time of the rape and that the offender is her legitimate father.
Since the facts alleged in the Information and the fact proven in court establish the qualifying circumstance of minority and relationship we hold appellant liable for qualified rape. Hence, death is the proper imposable penalty.
[42]
Third. 
In accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, we modify the award of damages by the trial court. For each count of rape, the following amounts are awarded to AAA:
a)
P75,000 as civil indemnity;
[43]
b)
P50,000 as moral damages;
[44]
 and
c)
P25,000 as exemplary damages.
[45]
