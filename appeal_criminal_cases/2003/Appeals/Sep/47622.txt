PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. JOSE PILLAS Y AMORIN ALIAS "CHE-AN," APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


"
How could you do that to me?  You are my father."
 AAA spoke with a lost heart when appellant subjected her to bestial abuse.  With the sheer perversity of her father, AAA was unjustly exposed to his libidinous indulgence.  Instead of providing protection to his daughter, he stripped her of the only thing she held dear.  He, like any father who subjects his child to shameless lechery, deserves not only condemnation but also loss of respect due him as a human being.
For automatic review is the Decision
[1]
 dated April 19, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 16, Zamboanga City, in Criminal Cases Nos. 15199, 15200, 15201 and 15202 convicting appellant Jose Pillas y Amorin of four counts of rape against his own daughter and imposing upon him the supreme penalty of death.
The four Informations filed against appellant are similarly worded, except as to the dates of commission of the crimes, thus:
 "That on or about July 16, 1998, in the City of Zamboanga, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of AAA, against her will; furthermore, there being present an aggravating circumstance in that the accused is the father of said AAA, who is only 16 years of age."
[2]
Upon arraignment, appellant, with the assistance of his counsel, pleaded not guilty.  A joint trial of the four criminal cases ensued.
The prosecution presented as its witnesses AAA, private complainant, Teresita Molina, SPO1 Judito TubaÃ±a, Dr. Jocelyn Onari and Barangay Captain Percival Toribio.
The version of the prosecution is as follows:  AAA was born on October 19, 1981 at Limaong Island, Zamboanga City.  She is the only child of appellant and 
Carmelita Quiamco
 who separated when she was about one month old.  They left her under the care of her paternal grandparents.
In 1993, when AAA was 11 years old, appellant took her into his custody in Sitio 
Anahaw, Dabuy, Upper Vitali
, Zamboanga City.  He was then living with his common-law wife, Teresita Molina, and her son (who left for Malaysia in 1995).
In January 1996, appellant ordered AAA to discontinue her studies because she stole rice from their house and sold it.  From 1996 to 1998, she stayed home and helped her parents in the domestic chores.
On July 16, 1998, at past 8 o'clock in the morning, while AAA was washing the dishes, her father asked about Teresita's whereabouts.  She informed him that Teresita was at the river washing their clothes.  Appellant said, 
"You know 
Lyn
, although you are my daughter, I like you."
  Taken aback by his perverted words, she responded, 
"Why were you able to say that?  I am your daughter."
  He then said, 
"I really like you and you are already a woman." AAA
 retorted
, "How could you tell that to your own daughter?"
 He replied that he does not know. Then he kissed her on the lips and held her breasts.  AAA struggled and tried to ward off his face.  She exclaimed, "
How could you do that to me?  You are my father."
 Without saying another word, appellant pulled her left hand. AAA tried to resist by holding on a piece of wood attached to the lavatory.  But her grip was not strong enough.  He dragged her to the living room and continued to kiss her and hold her breasts.  In spite of her struggle, he was able to undress and pin her down.  Again AAA asked why he was doing that to her.  He answered that it was because her stepmother is already old. Then he unzipped his short pants and pulled out his penis and inserted it into her vagina.  AAA felt pain.  While he was doing the pumping motion, he threatened to kill her if she would shout.  Before he rose, he kissed her on her mouth and nipples.  AAA saw her vagina bleeding.  She also saw blood and "something white" on his penis.  He wiped off the traces of blood on his penis and on her vagina so that Teresita would not be able to notice what happened.
[3]
 Before he went out, he reiterated his threat to kill AAA and Teresita should she report the matter to anybody.
On July 26, 1998 at around 10 o'clock in the morning, appellant's animal greed again possessed him.  At that time, he was playing guitar at the porch while Teresita was away washing clothes.  When AAA was preparing food for lunch, he suddenly kissed and carried her from the kitchen to the living room.  She tried hard to resist, but he was too strong for her petite physique.
[4]
 After undressing her, he placed himself on top of her.   He kissed her and inserted his penis into her vagina, telling her that since he reared and took care of her, 
"he should be the first one to take advantage or be benefited."
 According to AAA, she felt pain.
On July 30, 1998, at around 8 o'clock in the morning, appellant once more gave in to his lust.  AAA was inside her room fixing her clothes when he hastily pulled and dragged her to the living room.  For the third time, he sexually abused her by force and intimidation.
On August 11, 1998, at around 11 o'clock in the morning, while washing clothes at the river, AAA at last found the courage to inform Teresita what transpired.  They both cried.  Teresita then approached Percival Toribio, barangay chairman, who stated that appellant should be immediately arrested.
[5]
 Teresita, however, did not take any action as she was afraid of him.
[6]
Meanwhile, AAA's nightmare was not yet over.  On August 25, 1998, for the fourth time, appellant molested her sexually, again by means of force and threat.  After the incident, she told Teresita about it.  It was only after appellant left for Zamboanga City to sell his farm products that they decided to report the matter to the police.  On August 27, 1998, SPO1 Judito P. TubaÃ±a took AAA's statement and instructed her to undergo physical examination by a physician.
On August 28, 1998, Dr. Jocelyn Onari of the Zamboanga Medical Center examined AAA.  Dr. Onari issued a Medico-Legal Certificate
[7]
 stating that AAA has incomplete hymenal lacerations at 1, 5, 8 and 11 o'clock positions and that her introitus admitted one finger.
Appellant was then charged with four counts of rape and detained.  When he pleaded for forgiveness, AAA said, 
"I do not pity you because you did not pity me."
[8]
 Asked if she could quantify her pain and suffering in terms of money, AAA replied that even if she will not receive any amount, it is alright with her provided her father "suffer for the things he had done."
[9]
Appellant vehemently denied having committed the crimes.  He claimed that the reason why AAA charged him was because he asked her to quit school. She resented his command since she did not want to do the household chores and work in the farm.  With respect to Teresita, she was angry with him because he could not make love to her even once a month because he was suffering from hernia.
He denied having asked for forgiveness from AAA considering that he was dizzy while in detention.
[10]
After hearing, the trial court rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
 "WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused JOSE PILLAS y AMORIN alias CHE-AN GUILTY of the crime of Rape charged in Criminal Cases Nos. 15199, 15200, 15201 and 15202, defined and penalized under Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (
Sec. 2, R.A. No. 8353 known as `The Anti-Rape Law of 1997
'), committed against his own daughter, AAA who was below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the crimes charged, and 
SENTENCES
 said accused as follows:
 
In Criminal Case No. 15199, to suffer the penalty of DEATH with its accessory penalties in the manner provided by law; to pay the offended party, AAA, the sum of P50,000.00 as indemnity, P30,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages;
In Criminal Case No. 15200, to suffer the penalty of DEATH with its accessory penalties in the manner provided by law; to pay the offended party, AAA, the sum of P50,000.00 as indemnity; P30,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages;
In Criminal Case No. 15201, to suffer the penalty of DEATH with its accessory penalties in the manner provided by law; to pay the offended party, AAA, the sum of P50,000.00 as indemnity; P30,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages;
In Criminal Case No. 15202, to suffer the penalty of DEATH with its accessory penalties in the manner provided by law; to pay the offended party, AAA, the sum of P50,000.00 as indemnity; P30,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages; and
To pay the costs in all the four (4) cases.
"Let the complete records of these cases be forwarded to the Supreme Court for automatic review and judgment as provided by law.
"SO ORDERED."
[11]
Hence, this automatic review, appellant raising the following assignments of error:
 "I
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF FOUR (4) COUNTS OF RAPE.
"II
ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT ACCUSED IS INDEED GUILTY OF THE RAPE CHARGES, THE TRIAL COURT, NONETHELESS, ERRED IN IMPOSING THE DEATH PENALTY IN EACH OF THE FOUR (4) CASES."
Appellant contends that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  That there were lacerations in AAA's hymen does not conclusively show that she was raped.  In fact, Dr. Onari testified that those lacerations could also be caused by the insertion of a hard object, masturbation, trauma or horseback riding.
He could not have raped AAA because he loves her, being his only daughter.  She implicated him because he made her quit her studies.
Appellant assails the imposition of the penalty of death upon him in all four cases considering that the prosecution did not offer in evidence AAA's certificate of live birth.
Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 8353,
[12]
 the law governing these cases, provide:
 "Article 266-A. 
Rape; When And How Committed.
 - Rape is committed -
1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
 a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;
b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and
d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
2) By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person.
"Article 266-B. 
Penalties. 
â Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by
 reclusion perpetua.
x x x
"The death penalty shall be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:
1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim"
Thus, for appellant to be convicted of rape, it must be proven that there was physical evidence of penetration and that appellant forcibly subjected AAA to have sexual intercourse with him.
AAA testified as follows:

Well, he went on top of me and inserted his penis and he was doing the sexual intercourse motion."
[17]
 
 
AAA's testimony that her father had carnal knowledge of her four times is categorical and straightforward. Such testimony is one that could have been recounted only by a victim subjected to sexual assault.  It bears emphasis that in each occasion, he resorted to force and intimidation in order to consummate his lust.  And during each time, she struggled in order to resist his sexual attack.
Carnal knowledge is proven by two details: pain in the victim's genitalia and the findings of the medico-legal officer.
[18]
 Here, AAA was certain that appellant penetrated her genitalia because she felt pain every time he inserted his penis therein.  Moreover, Dr. Onari's medical findings of laceration and penetration reinforce our conclusion that appellant raped his daughter four times.
Besides, the trial court found AAA's testimony to be credible and straightforward.  We give great weight to the trial court's evaluation of the testimony of a witness because it had the opportunity to observe the facial expression, gesture, and tone of voice of a witness while testifying. The trial court is in a better position to determine whether a witness is lying or telling the truth.  We also find no basis to deviate from the settled rule that testimonies of rape victims who are young and immature are credible.
[19]
Appellant could only raise the defense of denial.  Denial is an intrinsically weak defense which must be supported by strong evidence of lack of culpability.  It is a negative, self-serving evidence, which cannot be accorded greater weight than the testimony of a credible witness who testified on affirmative matters.
[20]
 Thus, appellant cannot be liberated from his predicament even on his assertion that he loves AAA, being his only child.
Appellant's excuse that AAA was motivated by hatred and contempt in filing the rape charges against him simply because she was forced to discontinue her studies is too lame to be accepted as true.  The consequences of a rape charge are so serious and far-reaching.  In the instant case, AAA was fully aware that her father could face death if convicted of the crime with which he was charged.  Yet she remained steadfast in her testimony.  Thus, the supposed motives cannot sway the Court from lending full credence to her testimony.
[21]
 A young girl would not concoct a story that would cause her father's imprisonment or death and drag her family to perennial shame, if she did not have a genuine desire to vindicate her honor.
Contrary to appellant's conjecture, the testimony of Dr. Onari that hymenal lacerations could be caused by other factors cannot by itself be taken to mean that AAA had not been sexually abused by appellant.  In fact, there can still be a finding of rape even if the medical examination shows no vaginal laceration at all.
[22]
 We have consistently held that a medical examination of the victim is not indispensable to a prosecution for rape as it is merely corroborative in character.  Appellant may be convicted even solely on the basis of her credible, natural, and convincing testimony.
[23]
In fine, we find appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape on four counts.  However, the trial court erred in imposing upon him the death penalty.  On the basis of school records and appellant's admission,
[24]
 the trial court concluded that AAA was below 18 years of age when appellant sexually ravished her.
To warrant the imposition of the death penalty under  Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, the prosecution must allege in the Information and establish beyond reasonable doubt the twin qualifying circumstances of relationship between appellant and the victim and the latter's minority.
In the instant case, the evidence for the prosecution has shown that appellant is the father of AAA, a fact that he himself has maintained.
[25]
 However, the prosecution failed to prove her minority.
In 
People vs. Pruna
,
[26]
 we set the following guidelines in appreciating age, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance, thus:
 
The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an 
original or certified true copy
 of the 
certificate of live birth
 of such party.
In the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents such as 
baptismal certificate
 and 
school records
 which show the date of birth of the victim would suffice to prove age.
If the certificate of live birth or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the 
testimony
, if clear and credible, of the 
victim's mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matter respecting pedigree
 such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:
 
If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;
If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years old and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 12 years old;
If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years old and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 18 years old.
In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victim's mother or relatives concerning the victim's age, the 
complainant's testimony
 will suffice provided that it is 
expressly
 and 
clearly admitted
 by the accused.
It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against him.
The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim."
The prosecution failed to provide the required evidence to prove AAA's age.
First
, the original or certified true copy of AAA's certificate of live birth was never presented.
Second
, AAA's school records
[27]
 indicating she was born on October 19, 1981 were not duly certified and authenticated.  Although the baptismal certificate was presented to the trial court,
[28]
 it was not marked and formally offered in evidence.
Third
, while AAA testified that she was born on October 19, 1981,
[29]
 hence, was merely 16 years when she was raped, such testimony was 
not expressly and clearly admitted
 by appellant.   Besides, when the alleged age of the victim at the time of the sexual assault is between 13-18 years, her bare testimony would not suffice to prove her age and consequently qualify the crime to justify the imposition of the death penalty.
[30]
Fourth
, the absence of a contrary assertion, or appellant's silence on this matter, cannot exempt the prosecution from proving with certainty the victim's age.   The trial court cannot conclude that AAA was below 18 years of age when she was raped simply because appellant neither disputed nor contradicted her testimony.
Since there is no acceptable proof as to AAA's exact age, appellant must be held guilty only of simple, not qualified, rape.  Simple rape is punishable by reclusion perpetua, a single indivisible penalty.  Under Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, a single indivisible penalty shall be applied by the courts regardless of any attendant mitigating or aggravating circumstance.
Anent the award of damages, prevailing jurisprudence requires that moral damages be awarded in the amount of P50,000.00
[31]
 for each count of rape, or a total of P200,000.00, without need of pleading or proof of basis therefor.
[32]
 Here, the trial court awarded only  P30,000.00 in each case.
We affirm the award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity in each case, or a total of P200,000.00. We have consistently ruled that upon a finding of the fact of rape, the award of civil indemnity is mandatory.
[33]
 We likewise affirm the award of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape, or a total of P100,000.00.  Exemplary damages is awarded in view of the presence of the aggravating circumstance of relationship, and also to deter fathers with aberrant sexual behavior.
[34]
WHEREFORE
, the decision of the trial court is 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION
 as follows:
(a) Appellant is found 
GUILTY
 beyond reasonable doubt of four counts of 
SIMPLE RAPE
 in Criminal Cases Nos. 15199, 15200, 15201 and 15202 and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 in each case; and
(b) In each case, appellant is ordered to pay AAA the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages, or a total of P200,000.00;  P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, or a total of P200,000.00; and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages, or a total of  P100,000.00.
