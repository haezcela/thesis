PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROBERTO BANIHIT ALIAS "BOBBY", ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


On November 7, 1997, the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 33,
[1]

  convicted accused-appellant of rape in Criminal Case No. 39,591-97, 
sentenced him to death and ordered him to indemnify the victim in the 
sum of P50,000.00.


The victim, Glaiza Mae Banihit, is the niece of accused-appellant. Her 
father, Napoleon Banihit, is accused-appellantâs older brother.
[2]
  At the time of the incident, she was a day short of nine years in age.
[3]



On September 7, 1997, at around 6:00 oâclock in the evening, Lucita 
Banihit, Glaizaâs mother, was in her house located at Bagong Buhay, 
Agdao, Davao City, doing the laundry. Accused-appellant arrived looking 
for Napoleon. Lucita told him that Napoleon was not home. 
Accused-appellant asked for Glaiza, who was then in their neighborâs 
house watching television. A younger sister went to fetch her, and when 
she arrived, accused-appellant told her, "We will look for your father."
[4]



Accused-appellant and Glaiza rode a motorcycle and went to a grassy lot 
in a place called Del Pilar. There, accused-appellant undressed Glaiza 
and made her lie down on a big tire. Accused-appellant took off his own 
clothes, went on top of Glaiza and had sexual intercourse with her. 
Glaiza was pinned between the big tire and accused-appellant.
[5]
  She felt pain but was afraid to cry. After that, Glaiza put on her clothes, and she and accused-appellant walked home.
[6]



Accused-appellant and Glaiza walked towards her grandmotherâs house. 
Meanwhile, Lucita, who was looking for her daughter, found her and 
accused-appellant along Dacudao Avenue. Together, they proceeded to the 
house of Glaizaâs grandmother, followed by accused-appellant. Before 
they left, accused-appellant gave Glaiza P9.00 in coins to buy her 
pencils. When they reached the house, Lucita told her mother-in-law that
 she had already found Glaiza, and thereafter they went home.
[7]



Glaiza did not tell her mother what happened. The next evening, 
September 8, 1997, Glaiza could not sleep because she felt pain in her 
vagina. She had to tell her mother what she felt.
[8]
  Lucita examined Glaizaâs vagina and saw that it was reddish and found a pus-like discharge.
[9]



Lucita grilled her daughter to tell her what happened, and Glaiza said 
she was raped by her uncle. Since Lucita had no money, she told Glaiza 
that they will just go to the hospital to have her treated the following
 week. On September 16, 1997, Lucita brought Glaiza to the Regional 
Hospital, but they were advised to go to the City Health Office. There, 
Glaiza was examined by Dr. Danilo Ledesma, Medico-Legal Officer,
[10]

  who stated in his findings that he found Glaizaâs hymen to be "swollen
 with a healing deep laceration at 3 oâclock position corresponding to 
the face of a watch, edges congested, edematous, bleeds on slight 
manipulation".
[11]
  Further, Glaiza was found positive for gonorrhea which Dr. Ledesma confided to Lucita.
[12]



From the City Health Office, Lucita and Glaiza proceeded to the Sta. Ana
 Police Station, where they were referred to the Child and Youth 
Relationship Section (CYRS). The police entered the incident in the 
blotter. Lucita wanted to keep the matter a secret from her husband, 
Napoleon, for fear that he might kill his own brother. But when they 
returned home that evening, she had to tell Napoleon that he was being 
summoned at the CYRS the following day. He asked why, and Lucita told 
him that she had Glaiza examined and they will find out what her disease
 was at the CYRS. Later that night, at around 9:00 oâclock, Napoleon 
noticed that Glaiza was crying and uneasy. He scolded Glaiza and whipped
 her with his belt because she was tossing and turning in bed. Finally, 
Glaiza told her father what her uncle had done.
[13]



Napoleon left the house in anger. He went to the house of his mother to 
look for accused-appellant, who was living there. When he saw 
accused-appellant, he beat him up. He only stopped when he was pacified 
by their eldest brother, Benjamin, and ordered to leave.
[14]



After Napoleon left, Lucita went to the house of the Barangay Captain 
and narrated the rape incident to him. The Barangay Captain asked that 
Glaiza be brought to him and she told him that she was raped by her 
uncle. All three of them went to Lucitaâs house where they found 
accused-appellant, quite drunk. The Barangay Captain brought 
accused-appellant to the CYRS and left him there. The following day, 
Lucita, Glaiza and the Barangay Captain returned to the CYRS to file a 
formal complaint for rape against accused-appellant.
[15]



An Information was filed against accused-appellant on September 18, 
1997. After he pleaded not guilty, the trial of the case ensued.


At the hearing of October 10, 1997, the prosecution moved that 
accused-appellant be medically examined to determine whether he was 
likewise afflicted with the venereal disease.
[16]

  The trial court ruled that the examination would not violate 
accused-appellantâs right against self-incrimination, and directed the 
Warden of the Davao City Jail to cause the examination of 
accused-appellant at the Davao Medical Center.
[17]



Parenthetically, it is true that the constitutional right of an accused 
against self-incrimination proscribes the use of physical or moral 
compulsion to extort communications from the accused and not the 
inclusion of his body in evidence when it may be material. Purely 
mechanical acts are not included in the prohibition as the accused does 
not thereby speak his guilt, hence the assistance and guiding hand of 
counsel is not required. The essence of the right against 
self-incrimination is testimonial compulsion, that is, the giving of 
evidence against himself through a testimonial act. Hence, it has been 
held that an accused may be compelled to submit to physical examination 
and to have a substance taken from his body for medical determination as
 to whether he was suffering from gonorrhea which was contracted by his 
victim.
[18]



Accordingly, a urethral smear was performed on accused-appellant on 
October 11, 1997, after which Dr. Oscar P. Grageda, Pathologist of the 
Davao Medical Center, diagnosed the "presence of extacellular (sic) 
gram-negative diplococci."
[19]

  Explaining the meaning of these terms, Dr. Maria Fidela Hocson 
testified that the same was suggestive of venereal disease, specifically
 gonorrhea.
[20]



The prosecution rested its case. On November 3, 1997, at the hearing 
scheduled for reception of defense evidence, defense counsel manifested 
that accused-appellant refused to testify and that he had no other 
witnesses to present. The trial court informed accused-appellant of the 
consequences if he failed to present evidence in his defense, 
specifically, in the event the prosecution is able to establish his 
guilt beyond reasonable doubt, he may be sentenced to death. Despite 
this, accused-appellant insisted that he does not intend to present 
evidence on his behalf.


On November 7, 1997, the trial court promulgated its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:




    WHEREFORE, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
 crime of RAPE, and considering that the victim is a minor, nine years 
of age, and taking into account the qualifying circumstance of 
relationship, the victim being his niece within the third degree of 
consanguinity, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the supreme penalty of 
DEATH with all the accessory penalties provided for by law, and to 
indemnify the offended party in the amount of P50,000.00.
  



    His immediate confinement to the National Penitentiary is hereby ordered.
  



    Costs de officio.
  



    SO ORDERED.
[21]







Accused-appellant appealed the Decision on the following lone assignment of error:


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING THE EXTREME PENALTY OF DEATH FOR THE 
CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THAT ACCUSED WAS NOT PROPERLY INFORMED OF THE 
NATURE AND CAUSE OF THE ACCUSATION AGAINST HIM WHICH IS IN VIOLATION OF 
HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.
[22]



At the outset, it may not be amiss to state that the trial court was 
correct in its declaration that accused-appellant validly waived his 
right to present evidence. Although the right to present evidence is 
guaranteed by no less than the Constitution itself for the protection of
 the accused, this right may be waived expressly or impliedly.
[23]

  This is in consonance with the doctrine of waiver which recognizes 
that everyone has a right to waive, and agree to waive, the advantage of
 a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the 
individual in his private capacity, if it can be dispensed with and 
relinquished without infringing on any public right, and without 
detriment to the community at large.
[24]



Going now to the assignment of error, accused-appellant contends in fine
 that the trial court erred when it imposed the death penalty on him for
 the rape of his minor niece, when the Information accused him of rape 
under Article 335, paragraph 3, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by
 R.A. 7659, which provides:




    Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
  



    xxx.............................xxx.............................xxx.
  



    3.....When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.
  



    The crime of rape shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua.
 





Thus, accused-appellant prays that the penalty imposed on him be modified from death to 
reclusion perpetua.
[25]



The Information charges accused-appellant with the following acts:




    That on or about September 7, 1997, in the City of Davao, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above-mentioned accused by means of force and intimidation, did then and
 there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with 
(sic) his niece Glaiza Mae Banihit, who is nine (9) years old.
  



    CONTRARY TO LAW.
[26]







It can readily be gleaned that the commission of rape by 
accused-appellant as described in the body of the Information was 
attended by one of the seven circumstances which qualify rape, 
enumerated in then Article 335 (now Article 266-B) of the Revised Penal 
Code. More specifically, accused-appellantâs acts fall under the first 
mode, viz:


The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:




    1.....when the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the 
offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by 
consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the 
common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
  





Contrary to accused-appellantâs contention, what is controlling in an 
Information should not be the title of the complaint, nor the 
designation of the offense charged or the particular law or part thereof
 allegedly violated, these being, by and large, mere conclusions of law 
made by the prosecutor, but the description of the crime charged and the
 particular facts therein recited.
[27]




 x x x. In the event, however, that the appellation of the crime 
charged as determined by the public prosecutor, does not exactly 
correspond to the actual crime constituted by the criminal acts 
described in the information to have been committed by the accused, what
 controls is the description of the said criminal acts and not the 
technical name of the crime supplied by the public prosecutor. As this 
Court, through Justice Morelandâs authoritative disquisition, has held: 





"x x x.............................x x x.............................x x x.





 "From a legal point of view, and in a very real sense, it is of 
no concern to the accused what is the technical name of the crime of 
which he stands charged. It in no way aids him in a defense on the 
merits. x x x That to which his attention should be directed, and in 
which he, above all things else, should be most interested, are the 
facts alleged. The real question is not did he commit a crime given in 
the law some technical and specific name, but did he perform the acts 
alleged in the body of the information in the matter therein set forth. 
If he did, it is of no consequence to him, either as a matter of 
procedure or of substantive right, how the law denominates the crime 
which those acts constitute. The designation of the crime by name in the
 caption of the information from the facts alleged in the body of that 
pleading is a conclusion of law made by the fiscal. x x x For his full 
and complete defense he need not know the name of the crime at all. It 
is of no consequence whatever for the protection of his substantial 
rights. The real and important question to him is, âDid you perform the 
acts alleged in the manner alleged?â not, âDid you commit a crime named 
murder?â If he performed the acts alleged, in the manner stated, the law
 determines what the name of the crime is and fixes the penalty 
therefor.
 It is the province of the court alone to say what the 
crime is or what it is named. If the accused performed the acts alleged 
in the manner alleged, then he ought to be punished and punished 
adequately, whatever may be the name of the crime which those acts 
constitute.
"
    




 x x x.............................x x x.............................x x x."
[28]







In other words, the real nature of the criminal charge is determined not
 from the caption or preamble of the information nor from the 
specification of the provision of the law alleged to have been violated,
 they being conclusions of law which in no way affect the legal aspects 
of the information, but from the actual recital of facts as alleged in 
the body of the information.
[29]



Indeed, it is not the designation of the offense in the Information that
 is controlling but the allegations therein which directly apprise the 
accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.
[30]

  Therefore, accused-appellantâs constitutional right to be informed of 
the nature and cause of the accusation against him was not violated, 
notwithstanding that the preamble of the Information stated that he was 
being charged with the rape of a woman who was under twelve years of age
 or who was demented. As stated above, this was a mere conclusion of law
 made by the prosecutor who prepared the Information. It must be 
stressed that the acts described in the body of the Information clearly 
accused him of raping his niece, a relative by consanguinity within the 
third civil degree, who was a minor. That was sufficient to apprise him 
of the specific charge against him and to enable him to prepare his 
defense.


However, we find that accused-appellantâs relationship to the victim 
within the third civil degree, while proven by competent evidence, was 
not sufficiently alleged in the Information.


We have consistently held that the seven attendant circumstances in 
Article 335 (now Article 266-B) of the Revised Penal Code, given that 
they alter the nature of the crime of rape and thus increase the degree 
of the penalty, are in the nature of qualifying circumstances. Plainly, 
these attendant circumstances added by R.A. 7659 are not ordinary 
aggravating circumstances, which merely increase the period of the 
penalty. These are special qualifying circumstances which must be 
specifically pleaded or alleged with certainty in the information; 
otherwise, the death penalty cannot be imposed.
[31]



This Court has ruled in a long line of cases that the circumstances 
under the amendatory provisions of Section 11 of Republic Act 7659, the 
attendance of any of which mandates the single indivisible penalty of 
death are in the nature of qualifying circumstances which cannot be 
proved as such unless alleged with particularity in the information 
unlike ordinary aggravating circumstances which affect only the period 
of the penalty and which may be proven even if not alleged in the 
information.
[32]



In People v. Ferolino,
[33]
  we
 held that the allegation that the victim was the accused-appellantâs 
niece is not specific enough to satisfy the special qualifying 
circumstances of relationship. If the offender is merely a relation --- 
not a parent, ascendant, step-parent, or guardian or common law spouse 
of the mother of the victim -- it must be alleged in the information 
that he is "a relative by consanguinity or affinity [as the case may be]
 within the third civil degree." Even if that relationship by 
consanguinity or affinity was alleged in the informations in that case, 
it was still necessary to further allege that such relationship was 
within the third civil degree.


As such, accused-appellant can only be held liable for simple rape and sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua.



In addition to the trial courtâs award of civil indemnity, we award to 
the victim, Glaiza Mae Banihit, moral damages in the amount of 
P50,000.00, without need for pleading or proof of the basis thereof. The
 fact that the complainant in rape has suffered the trauma of mental, 
physical and psychological sufferings which constitute the basis for 
moral damages are too obvious to still require recital thereof at the 
trial by the victim since we assume and acknowledge such agony on her 
part as a gauge of her credibility.
[34]




WHEREFORE,
 accused-appellant is found GUILTY beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of simple rape and is sentenced to suffer 
the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua.
 Accused-appellant is also 
ordered to pay the victim, Glaiza Mae Banihit, civil indemnity in the 
amount of P50,000.00 and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00.
