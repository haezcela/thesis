CARPIO MORALES, J.:


On review is the Court of Appeals Decision
[1]
 dated October 18, 2001 affirming with modification the consolidated judgment of Branch 52 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Puerto Princesa convicting accused-appellant of three offenses in Criminal Case Nos. 10104, 10314, and 10315.
On April 9, 1992 at around 10:00 o'clock in the evening, a grenade exploded near the Northern Operators and Drivers Association (NODA) terminal at Malvar Street, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, killing Elias Laurente (Elias) who was at the second floor of his 2-storey house nearby, and slightly injuring two children and an elderly lady in the vicinity.
The following day, April 10, 1992, at close to midnight, Elpedio Presto (Presto) of Barangay Matahimik, Puerto Princesa City gave a sworn statement
[2]
 before the Puerto Princesa police alleging that the night before, while he was watching television at his house, he was fetched by his wife's cousin to extend help to one Ome Pareja, who was being awaited at the terminal by some persons;  and as soon as Ome emerged from the terminal, he (Ome) and the persons waiting for him including accused-appellant Florante Padrones (appellant) had an altercation and as he (Presto) attempted to pacify the parties, appellant at once pulled the pin of a grenade and 
threw it at his adversaries.
At the same time and day, April 10, 1992, Anastacio Lastrella and Domingo Lastrella (the Lastrellas) also gave a 
joint
 sworn statement before the police alleging that the night before, while they were standing by the NODA terminal, "
may dalawang taong lasing na sina
 ANGGAY PADRONES 
at
 ROMEO PAREJA 'ALIAS OME' 
na may dalang granada at si
 [appellant] ANGGAY PADRONES 
ang may hawak ng nasabing granada
;"  that appellant warned "
na huwag kang (sic) lalapit sa akin at ikaw (sic) ay madadamay lang dito sa gulong ito;
"  and that appellant threw the grenade 
towards
 a 
carinderia
 which landed and exploded on the ground, following which he immediately fled, and while they chased him, they failed.
More than two months after Presto and the Lastrellas gave their sworn statements or on June 17, 1992, they executed their respective 
Pagbabawi ng Salaysay
.
In their 
Pagbabawi ng Pinagsamang Salaysay
, the Lastrellas alleged that, 
inter alia
, they did not "
gaanong naintindihan"
 what were incorporated in their earlier joint statement as they were drunk during the incident and had a hang-over at the time it was taken, and they were not certain that appellant was the one who threw the grenade as "
may kadiliman
" at the spot where the person threw the grenade.

Na kami ay nagsagawa ng isang Pinagsamang Salaysay noong ika-10 ng Abril, 1992 tungkol sa isang insidente na nagyari noong ika-9 ng gabi ng Abril, 1992 sa Malvar Street, Puerto Princesa City;
  Na ang nga nakasaad sa nasabing salaysay ay 
hindi namin gaanong naunawaan dahil kami ay naka-inom noong gabi at may hang-over noong ginawa ang nasabing salaysay;
   Na 
hindi namin sigurado na si Anggay Padrones nga ang taong nagtapon ng granada dahil noong mangyari and insidente ay medyo may kadiliman sa bahaging kinaroroonan ng taong naghagis at hindi namin gaanong maaninag kung sino ang nagtapon ng granada;
 Na ang sinsabi naming Anggay Padrones na nagtapon ng granada ay 
ayon lamang sa aming mga narinig na usap-usapan ngunit ito ay hindi naming tiyak;
Na kami ay nagkasundo na hindi na magtitistigo laban kay Florante "Anggay" Padrones at aming  
pinawalang saysay ang aming naunang ginawang Pinagsanib na salaysay
 sapagkat talagang hindi namin sigurado na si Anggay Padrones nga ang naghagis ng granada.

 Na 
ang mga nakasaad sa nasabing salaysay ay hindi ko gaanong naunawaan dahil sa bilis ng pangyayari at agarang pagbibigay ko ng aking malayang salaysay;
Na noong pagbigay ko ng aking Malayang Salaysay sa himpilan ng Pulisya ay 
hindi ko pa gaanong naunawaan ang puno at dulo ng pangyayari at ang pangalang Anggay Padrones ay narinig ko lamang
 sa mga taong nag-uusap-usap na yon daw ang pangalan ng naghagis ng granada;
 
Na matapos kong makita ang sinasabi nilang Anggay Padrones ay natitiyak kong hindi siya ang taong nakita ko na naghagis ng granada
, at maaaring napagkamalan  lamang siya ng ibang tao at ang pangalan niya ang sinasabi na naghagis ng granada;
Na ako ay kusang loob na nagsagawa ng salaysay na ito upang ipaliwanag saysay ang aking naunang ginawang salaysay at hindi na ako magtetistigo laban sa pagkatao ni Ginoong Florante "Anggay" Padrones.

 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)  
Listed in each of the three informations were the following five common witnesses, Presto and the Lastrellas (the three who had previously executed sworn statements dated April 10, 1992 pointing to appellant as the person they saw hurling the grenade but who subsequently executed affidavits of June 17, 1992 
recanting
 said sworn statements), the victim's brother Ruben T. Laurente, and one Abet ValeÃ±a. 
Upon arraignment, appellant entered a plea of not guilty.
[10]
On the scheduled hearing of the cases on June 8, 
1993
, the prosecution manifested that three (Presto and the two Lastrellas) of the five witnesses listed in the informations had executed (on June 17, 
1992
) "affidavits of desistance" before the NBI.  The prosecution thereupon called to the witness stand, without offering the purpose of his testimony,
[11]
 Nathan Hermosura (Hermosura), a resident of 20-B Malvar St., Puerto Princesa City.  No objection to the admission of Hermosura's testimony was, however, raised by the defense.
Hermosura, a tricycle driver, 
for the first time since the incident occurred more than a year earlier
, gave an account of what he claimed to have witnessed, as follows:
About 10:00 o'clock in the evening of April 9, 1992, while he was resting by the roadside fronting the NODA terminal at Malvar Street,
[12]
 he, at a distance of ten meters, saw appellant, also known in the place as "Anggay Padrones," arrive on a tricycle with a companion.  On stepping down from the tricycle, appellant "suddenly approached his 
companion
 while some w[ere] trying to pacify them."
[13]
  An altercation ensued following which appellant, holding a hand grenade with his left hand and the safety pin thereof with his right,
[14]
 threatened to throw it to the 
persons
 with whom he was quarrelling.  Appellant, who was at the middle of the road, soon pulled the safety pin of the greande and 
threw it to his enemies
[15]
 who were more or less two to three meters away.
[16]
Hermosura went on to declare as follows:
Before the grenade could explode, appellant fled, and the intended victims chased him.  Roughly ten seconds after the grenade was thrown, it exploded at which time appellant and the intended victims were already far, hence, none of them was injured by the blast.
[17]
The prosecution also presented the doctor who attended to the fatality Elias at the hospital, as well as Elias' brother Ruben Laurente who testified on the civil aspect of the case consisting of claims for actual damages in the amount of P20,000.00 to P25,000.00
[18]
 representing expenses for interment, and moral damages in the amount of P200,000.00 on account of his brother's death.
[19]
 
The prosecution furthermore presented SPO1 Rolando Amorao of the Firearm and Explosive Unit of the Philippine National Police (PNP) who declared that appellant was not duly licensed or authorized to possess any firearm or explosive, as borne out by the certification issued by the Provincial Director of PNP of Palawan.
[20]
This Court notes that the fifth listed witness in the informations, Abet ValeÃ±a, was not subpoenaed to testify.  Nor was he presented by the prosecution. 
Appellant, who gave his occupation as cockpit referee, a resident of Libis, San Pedro, Puerto Princesa City, denied the accusations.  Admitting that he was at the NODA terminal at Malvar Street on April 9, 1992 at around 10:00 o'clock in the evening, he gave his version of the incident as follows: 
While he was at the NODA terminal about to board a vehicle bound for Roxas, three strangers who were drunk approached him, asking him where he was going, to which he replied that he was going to Roxas.  Without any provocation, the strangers uttered invectives at him and they "quarreled," drawing him to retreat.  As he was retreating, he noticed that something was thrown at him by one of the three.  He thus "ran and that thing exploded."  He then decided to go home.
[21]
The following day he was apprehended by the police who told him that he was pointed to as the suspect by witnesses Presto and the Lastrellas.
[22]
  When he confronted the three, however, they told him that they just heard his name mentioned by the police and that they were even drunk when they made their statements.  That explains why the three repaired to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to withdraw their statements implicating him.
[23]
The defense also presented Romeo Pareja
[24]
 (Pareja), the father of the two girls, Annalyn and Genelyn, who were slightly injured by the explosion. 
At the witness stand, Pareja declared as follows: 
On the date and time of the incident, he, together with his wife and his two daughters were walking on their way home from Mendoza Park.
[25]
  As they were passing through Malvar Street, he noticed that appellant was engaged in a conversation with three persons.  He soon heard an explosion
[26]
 but he did not see who was responsible therefor.  While he later came to know that appellant was accused for the incident, he did not lodge any complaint against him as the injuries of his children were only slight.
[27]
By the assailed consolidated judgment, the trial court convicted appellant of the three charges. The decretal text of the trial court's decision reads:
"WHEREFORE, premises considered, a consolidated judgment is hereby rendered declaring that in:
CRIMINAL CASE NO. 10,104, the accused FLORANTE PADRONES is found and pronounced 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of 
homicide
 and there being no modifying circumstances appreciated, and applying the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, he is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty ranging from a minimum of EIGHT (8) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor in its medium period, to a maximum of FOURTEEN (14) YEARS and TEN (10) MONTHS of reclusion temporal in its medium period; to pay the heirs of Elias Laurente;
a)   Actual and compensatory damages
      for funeral and interment expenses -------------P25,000.00;
      and
b)   Civil indemnity for the     death of the
      victim, Elias Laurente ----------------------------P50,000.00.
CRIMINAL CASE NO.10,314, the accused Florante Padrones is found and pronounced 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Violation of COMELEC RESOLUTION NO. 2323
, and there being no modifying circumstances appreciated, and being entitled to the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, he is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty ranging from a minimum of ONE (1) YEAR and ONE (1) DAY to a maximum of FOUR (4) YEARS, and shall not be qualified for probation nor from holding public office and from the right to suffrage.
CRIMINAL CASE NO. 10,315, the accused FLORANTE PADRONES is found and pronounced 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
illegal possession of explosives in violation
 of Sec. 3, Presidential Decree 1866, and there being no modifying circumstances appreciated, he is hereby sentenced to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of reclusion temporal in its maximum period, to twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal also in its maximum period; and to pay the costs in each of the three cases.
SO ORDERED."
[28]
  (Emphasis an underscoring supplied)
On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification the consolidated judgment of the trial court, the dispositive portion of which reads:
"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the consolidated judgment dated November 20, 1995 is hereby 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
. The appellant is hereby convicted of the crime of 
murder
 penalized under Article 248, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code, 
but the conviction of the appellant under Presidential Decree No. 1866 is hereby disregarded in view of the promulgation of Republic Act No. 8294.
[29]
However, consonant with the findings of this Court increasing the penalty imposable upon the appellant from 
reclusion perpetua
 to death, and in relation to Section 13, 2
nd
 paragraph, Rule 124 of the Revised Penal Code, We hereby certify and elevate the entire records of this case to the Supreme Court for further review.
SO ORDERED."
[30]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
The appellate court before which the defense challenged the credibility of prosecution alleged eyewitness Hermosura held that his positive testimony, which reflected a straightforward recollection of what he witnessed at the time of the incident and was not rebutted by appellant's mere denial,
[31]
 proved appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
Brushing aside appellant's claim that one of the three strangers with whom he had altercation before the explosion occurred was the one who threw the grenade, the appellate court held, 
quoted 
verbatim
:
The appellant postulated the authorship of the bombing to one of the three male individuals whom he had altercation minutes before the explosion.  To our bewilderment, it is inconceivable why the appellant, who had been a resident of the place for more than twenty (20) years, does not have a slight idea who were the said three male individuals.  He did not even soliloquize the cause of their disagreement and altercation if only to give a convincing narration of the facts.  More importantly, the appellant is facing an impasse signifying the termination of the very reason for his existence.  His freedom for the remaining years of his life is at stake.  If indeed his assertions are true, then, he should have been vigilant of finding the felon who threw the grenade and let him face the court to answer for all the consequences of the felon's evil actions.  But he did not.  He merely says he doesn't know them neither the reason for their dispute.
[32]
Thus finding appellant to have thrown the hand grenade which exploded and resulted to the death of Elias, the appellate court held that "the attendant explosion" qualified the crime to murder,
[33]
 with the enactment of Republic Act No. 8294, it stressing that appellant should not be penalized for the separate offense of illegal possession of explosive under P.D. No. 1866.
[34]
The appellate court was silent with respect to appellant's conviction for violation of COMELEC Resolution No. 2323.
In light of the 2
nd
 paragraph of Section 13 of Rule 124
[35]
 of the Revised Rules of Court, the case was certified and elevated to this Court for decision.
A review of the records of the case leaves much to be desired on the credibility of the testimony of prosecution witness Hermosura âmain anchor of the conviction of appellant.  
Consider the following testimony of Hermosura on direct examination on the facts surrounding the death of Elias â from the alleged altercation between appellant and the unidentified men through the alleged throwing of the hand grenade by appellant to his alleged bringing of the two children victims to a nearby hospital, 
quoted
 verbatim.

On cross-examination,
[37]
 Hermosura claimed that he brought the two children to the hospital, one of whom was hit on the temple by a shrapnel, and the other sustained a wound at her back.
[38]
  When asked, however, who the children were, he could not furnish their names.
Hermosura's testimony that he brought the children to the hospital is belied by their father's claim that he brought them to the hospital.  That he does not even know the names of the children, assuming that he assisted the father in bringing them to the hospital, betrays his prevarication, for it is incredible that he would not have come to know their names, given the usual procedure in hospitals to note down the names of patients.
As for Hermosura's claim that the children were more or less two (2) meters away from the explosion, it is likewise belied by their father's testimony that "he and his family were more or less 
12 meters from the place where the blast occurred.
"
[39]
  Not only that.  It is incredible.  For by the natural course of things, if the children were merely two meters away from the place where the blast occurred, they would have been killed or maimed or seriously wounded.  But they merely suffered slight injuries.
Romeo Pareja's testifying for the defense, instead of for the prosecution, only indicates that he was not convinced of appellant's involvement.
More incredibilities.  When asked where the fatal victim Elias was when the grenade exploded, Hermosura declared that the latter was "at the second floor of their house inside the room."
[40]
  When pressed how he could have known of Elias whereabouts, he replied that he "used to pass by the house of the victim and he knew that by that time he was asleep at his room upstair[s]."
[41]
And why Hermosura remained at the scene where the alleged warring parties were, despite his claim that appellant was dangling the grenade for 2 minutes before he threw it,
[42]
 defies credulity.  For the normal reaction of a person who is faced with a threat to his life with the possible throwing of a hand grenade in the vicinity would be, in an instinct of self-preservation, to hie to a safe place to avoid being hit in case it is thrown as it was, in the case at bar, eventually.
On Hermosura's claim that appellant threw the hand grenade to his adversaries who were about 2 to 3 meters away:
[43]
  Why a person in the offensive who tries to harm his enemies by throwing a grenade at such close distance, which undoubtedly could also cause him harm unless of course he wants to commit 
hara-kiri
, further defies credulity.
Hermosura's lack of credibility becomes more pronounced on considering his belated posturing as a witness for the prosecution. 
Notatu digdum
 is his failure to immediately give any statement in connection with the case, like the three alleged eyewitnesses who were to recant their statements later.  It was only more that a year from the occurrence of the incident on April 9, 1992 or on June 8, 1993 that he, 
for the first time
, gave his account, when he took the witness stand, of what he allegedly witnessed.  His explanation behind his failure to timely give a statement â that he took care of the deceased, who certainly did not lie in state for more than a year â betrays his absolute lack of knowledge of the incident.
To be credible, testimonial evidence should come not only from the mouth of a credible witness.  The testimony must also be credible, reasonable and in accord with human experience.
[44]
 No better test has yet been found to determine the weight of the testimony of a witness than its conformity to the knowledge and common experience of mankind.
[45]
  This Court finds that Hermosura's testimony failed to pass this test.
Since the prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence but it has failed to discharge its burden of 
prima facie
 proving the guilt beyond reasonable doubt of appellant, the burden of the evidence did not pass to the defense.   This leaves it unnecessary to discuss the merits of the defense.  Suffice it to state that appellant's tale is not incredible.
WHEREFORE
, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated October 18, 2001 is hereby 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE
 for failure of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of appellant, Florante Padrones, who is accordingly hereby 
ACQUITTED
 of all the crimes charged against him. 
Director Dionisio Santiago of the Bureau of Correction, Muntinlupa City, is hereby directed to forthwith cause the release of appellant Florante Padrones unless he is being lawfully held for another cause and to inform the Court accordingly within 10 days from notice.
Let a copy of this Decision be furnished Director Santiago.
