THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. WENNIE PESPENIAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
DECISION




REYES, J. JR., J.:


Two armed assailants as against an unarmed victim and companions constitute taking advantage of superior strength.
The Case
This is an ordinary appeal from the June 22, 2018 Court of Appeals (CA) Decision
[1]
 in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02160, affirming the January 22, 2015 Regional Trial Court (RTC) Decision
[2]
 in Criminal Case No. DNO-2932, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder.
The Facts
In an Information
[3]
 dated February 4, 2003, accused Wennie Pespenian
[4]
 (Pespenian) and Ireneo Salili (Salili) were charged with Murder. Pespenian was arrested and detained, while Salili remains at large.
[5]
 During arraignment, Pespenian pleaded not guilty.
[6]
 A warrant of arrest was issued for the arrest of Salili.
[7]
 Thereafter, pre-trial and trial followed.
The prosecution presented three witnesses: 1) Alejandro Pilota (Pilota), the victim's companion; 2) Neri Valenzona (Valenzona), another companion of the victim; and 3) Dr. Eufemia P. Maratas (Dr. Maratas), Municipal Health Officer of Pilar, Camotes.
[8]
Pilota testified that at 7 p.m. of January 2, 2003, he was at Joel Manza's (Manza) house with Brigido Colminas (Colminas), Valenzona, and many others to have dinner as it was the last night of prayers for Manza's late wife. After dinner, Pilota, Colminas and Valenzona left. Pilota and Valenzona accompanied Colminas on his way home, because they heard from the other guests that Pespenian and Salili were planning to take Colminas' life.
[9]
On their way, they met the two accused. Pespenian stabbed Colminas several times on the left and right chest down to his foot using an eight-inch knife, while Salili was holding a pistol and stayed behind Pespenian.
[10]
Pilota saw the whole incident and the identity of the assailants as he was holding a flashlight four meters away from Colminas. He and Valenzona were stunned with the attack and were unable to help Colminas. Thereafter, Pespenian and Salili chased them, prompting them to ran away.
[11]
Valenzona corroborated Pilota's testimony. The attack happened about 15 meters away from Colminas' house. He saw Pespenian stabbed Colminas while Salili pointed a gun at the latter. When Colminas fell, Pespenian and Salili went after him and Pilota. They ran away and hid to avoid getting assaulted.
[12]
The last prosecution witness was Dr. Maratas, who testified that she conducted a post mortem examination on Colminas' body on January 3, 2003, and issued a post mortem report. She confirmed that Colminas had multiple stab wounds which caused massive bleeding that led to his death. Colimas had 18 wounds all over his body, found on his cheeks, forearm, chest, abdomen, right knee, and right foot.
[13]
For his defense, Pespenian testified that at around 7:30 p.m. on January 2, 2003, he was with Salili fishing. Once done, they went home. On their way, they encountered Colminas, who was holding a knife. Salili and Colminas grappled for the knife. Pespenian feared for his life and left to go home. The following day, he learned that Colminas died, and he was arrested instead of Salili, because he had fled. He said there were no other witnesses to the incident.
[14]
The RTC Decision
On January 22, 2015, the RTC convicted Pespenian of Murder, imposed the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, and ordered him to pay Colminas' heirs P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, P25,000.00 as temperate damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.
[15]
The RTC ruled the presence of aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength, which pertains to the inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressors. It was purposely selected to facilitate the commission of the crime. Here, the accused were armed with a knife and a gun, while Colminas had nothing to defend himself. The accused took advantage of their weapons and their number against an unarmed victim, which is an aggravating circumstance.
[16]
Aggrieved, Pespenian appealed to the CA.
The CA Decision
On June 22, 2018, the CA affirmed with modification the RTC's decision. The CA increased the award of moral damages to P75,000.00, exemplary damages to P75,000.00, and temperate damages to P50,000. The CA retained the P75,000.00 civil indemnity. All monetary awards shall earn an interest of 6% per annum from the date of finality of the decision until fully paid.
[17]
Unsuccessful, Pespenian appealed his conviction before the Court.
The Issue Presented
The sole issue for resolution is whether or not the CA erred in affirming Pespenian's conviction for murder.
The Court's Ruling
The Court affirms the conviction.
In his Brief, Pespenian alleges that the prosecution witnesses failed to identify him as Colminas' assailant because the place of incident was dark and there was no showing that the witnesses saw his face. The Court is not convinced.
[18]
First
, Pespenian admitted during his direct examination that he and Salili encountered the victim, Colminas, on their way home. He narrated that Colminas was holding a knife, and fought over it with Salili. However, he left them out of fear.

Direct Examination of Pespenian - TSN dated October 1, 2010, pp. 8-10
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
You mentioned awhile ago that after fishing you went home, did you arrive to your house?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
No.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
Why?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
We met the victim there at the road.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
Meaning to say, you met Brigido Colminas at the road when you were on your way home?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
Yes, ma'am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
And when you met, what happened next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
He approached us.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
And after that what happened?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
That's the time that the incident happened because he approached us.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
What did he do when he [approached] you and Ireneo Salili? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
I saw Brigido Colminas was carrying a knife.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
You mentioned awhile ago that Brigido Colminas approached you and he was then during that time carrying a knife. So, when [he] approached you, what happened next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
Ireneo Salili and Brigido Colminas were grappling each other [for] the knife.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
What did you do when you saw them grappling with each other with a knife?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
I left them and I proceeded my way to my home.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
You did not bother to pacify?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
No, I did not because I was already afraid.
 
 
 
Pespenian's admission puts him on the crime scene while a crime was being committed. His admission contradicts his claim that the prosecution witnesses did not see him because it was dark.
Second
, it was established during the examination of the prosecution witnesses that the place where the incident took place was not totally dark. There was illumination coming from the flashlight, which helped the witnesses see the attackers. The witnesses were only four meters away from Colminas as he was being assaulted. The witnesses knew the accused as they lived near each other. Pespenian even admitted during his cross examination that he knew Pilota and Valenzona as they were neighbors.
[20]
 In sum, the light, the distance, and the familiarity with the accused aided the prosecution witnesses to identify them.
The following excerpts support the conviction of the accused. The 
details narrated below prove that the witnesses saw the faces of the 
accused, the weapons used, and their participation in the crime.

A:

From the foregoing stenographic notes and the Post Mortem 
Examination Report,
[21]
 the elements of murder are sufficiently 
established that: 1) a person was killed; 2) the accused killed him; 3) 
the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances 
mentioned in Article 248; and 4) the killing is not parricide or 
infanticide.
[22]
Here, 
the accused Pespenian was positively identified by the two prosecution 
witnesses to have stabbed Colminas that resulted to his death. The 
killing was not parricide as the victim and the accused were not 
ascendants or descendants of each other, and neither is it infanticide 
as the victim is an adult.
The only element left for discussion 
is whether the killing was attended by the qualifying circumstance of 
taking advantage of superior strength in Article 248 of the Revised 
Penal Code.
In his Brief, Pespenian avers that the prosecution 
failed to adduce evidence to prove that he purposely sought the 
advantage or deliberately used it, in the attack. He asserts that 
Colminas was not defenseless as he had two companions who were supposed 
to protect him.
[23]
The Court is not persuaded.
Here, the RTC determined the presence of qualifying circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength.
The aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength is considered whenever there is notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressors that is plainly and obviously advantageous to the aggressors and purposely selected or taken advantage of to facilitate the commission of the crime. It is taken into account whenever the aggressor purposely used excessive force that is "out of proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked." The victim need not be completely defenseless in order for the said aggravating circumstance to be appreciated.
In the instant case, accused, in perpetrating the crime was armed with a knife and his co-accused Ireneo Salili with a gun, while Brigido Colminas had nothing to defend himself.
As testified by the witness, accused Wennie was stabbing Brigido many times while his co-accused Ireneo Salili was pointing a gun at Brigido. The two (2) accused therefore took advantage that they were both armed in attacking their unarmed and defenseless victim. Such intention is evidenced by the 18 stab and incised wounds combined, which can be found in the different parts of the body of the accused on account of the attack made.
[24]
The CA had a similar pronouncement.
There is abuse of superior strength when the perpetrators of a crime deliberately used excessive force, thereby rendering the victim incapable of defending himself. The notorious inequality of forces creates an unfair advantage for the aggressor.
In the case at bench, accused-appellant and his co-accused evidently armed themselves with deadly weapons. Accused-appellant used a knife and with it stabbed Colminas inflicting no less than eighteen (18) wounds upon the latter. Co-accused Salili, for his part, held a gun, which he pointed towards Colminas' direction. On the other hand, Colminas was unarmed. While Colminas had companions at that time, they were similarly unarmed and were overwhelmed by fear of assailants. Accused-appellant and co-accused clearly exploited their superior advantage in number and weapons to ensure the attainment of their hideous plan, 
i.e
., death to Colminas.
[25]
The Court further observes that the prosecution witnesses testified that Pespenian and Salili ran after them after the stabbing incident. This shows that the assailants knew that they had the upper hand because they were armed, and they demonstrated their superiority by going after the unarmed witnesses.
Well-settled is the rule that findings of fact of the trial court, particularly when affirmed by the CA, are binding upon this Court.
[26]
 We have reviewed the case and we see no compelling reason to reverse the conviction. The trial court and the appellate court were unanimous in their findings of fact and conclusions of law. Their rulings were based on evidence on record, law, and jurisprudence.
