PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. EDGARDO GARCIA Y ANCHETA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
DECISION




LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


The Case
This appeal
[1]
 assails the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R CR-H.C. No. 07526 dated September 30, 2016
[2]
 affirming appellant's conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (RA) 9165.
[3]
The Proceedings Before the Trial Court
The Charge
By Information dated July 12, 2013, appellant Edgardo Garcia y Ancheta was charged with violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, thus:
That on or about the 4
th
 day of July 2013, in the City of San Fernando, La Union, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, deliver and sell one (1) piece of heat sealed transparent plastic sachet containing methamphetamine hydrochloride otherwise known as "
shabu
", a dangerous drug, with a net weight of zero point zero two three one (0.0231) gram to PO3 Elvis L. Yaris, who posed as poseur buyer, and in consideration of said 
shabu
, used marked money, consisting of one (1) piece of fake One Thousand peso Bill (P1,000.00) bearing serial number B081871, without fist securing the necessary permit, license or authority from the proper government agency.
Contrary to Law.
[4]
 
The case was raffled to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) - Branch 29, San Fernando City, La Union.
On arraignment, appellant pleaded 
not guilty
.
During the trial, PSI Maria Theresa Amor Manuel,
[5]
  PO3 Marie June Milo,
[6]
 PO3 Elvis Yaris, PO3 John Ely Bayan, and DZNL radio announcer Rico Valdez testified for the prosecution. Appellant was the lone witness for the defense.
[7]
The Prosecution's Version
PO3 Yaris
 testified that on July 4, 2013, around midnight, a confidential informant (CI) went to the San Fernando City police station to report that appellant was selling 
shabu
 at Paris Building, Barangay III, Rizal Ave., San Fernando City. Acting on this report, P/Supt. Manuel Apostol instructed his subordinates to conduct a buy-bust operation.
[8]
 He (PO3 Yaris) was designated as poseur-buyer and PO3 Bayan as back-up. They prepared the buy-bust money consisting of one Php 1,000 bill marked with his initials "ELY." Thereafter, the CI accompanied the team to the place of operation.
[9]
Around 1:20 in the morning, appellant arrived. The CI approached appellant and they had a brief conversation. He later joined in and the CI introduced him to appellant as an interested buyer. He said he was buying Php1,000-worth and handed the marked bill to appellant, who, in turn, brought out one (1) heat-sealed plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance from his right pocket and turned it over to him.
[10]
After he secured the item, he placed it in his pocket and arrested appellant. PO3 Bayan and PO2 Lucena rushed to where they were and helped him restrain appellant. He conducted a body search following the latter's arrest and recovered the buy-bust money, a cellular phone, two (2) lighters, and a Swiss knife from him.
[11]
Ten (10) minutes later, media representative Rico Valdez and 
Punong Barangay
 Pepito Lim arrived at the place of arrest. He laid the seized items on the pavement and proceeded to mark and inventory said items in their presence. PO2 Bermudez took photos to document the operation.
[12]
His team brought appellant to the City Health Office for medical examination. He prepared the request for laboratory examination and submitted it with the plastic sachet to the Regional Crime Laboratory Office 1. He was in possession of the item from the time appellant handed it to him until PO3 Milo received it at the crime laboratory.
[13]
PO3 Bayan
 essentially corroborated PO3 Yaris' factual narration.
[14]
Meanwhlie, 
Rico Valdez
 testified that a police officer called him to witness the inventory of items seized from appellant. When he arrived at the place of arrest, he saw PNP members, appellant, and 
Punong Barangay
 Lim. PO3 Yaris showed him the seized items consisting of a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance, buy-bust money in the amount of Php1,000, a cellphone, two (2) lighters, and a Swiss knife, all laid down on the pavement. Thereafter, PO3 Yaris marked the items in their presence and prepared an inventory. He and Lim signed the Certification of Inventory as witnesses.
[15]
The prosecution marked the following evidence: Joint Affidavit Complaint of PO3 Yaris and SPO3 Bayan; one (1) heat-sealed plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance; buy-bust money; one unit Nokia cellular phone; Swiss knife; two lighters; Pre-operational Report; Coordination Report; Request for Laboratory Report; Certification of Inventory; Initial Laboratory Report with Final Chemistry Report; Photographs; Medical Certificate of appellant; and Sketch.
[16]
The Defense's Evidence
Appellant denied the allegations against him. He narrated that even before his arrest, he already knew PO3 Yaris and PO3 Bayan because he arranged an entrapment operation with them for the arrest of a certain Gina Alvento who planned on illegally mortgaging a firearm to his brother, the Chief 
Barangay Tanod
. The police officers provided him with Php2,000 boodle money for the operation.
On June 29, 2013, Alvento went to his house with a .38 firearm. He tried to contact PO3 Yaris and PO3 Bayan but failed to reach them so other officers arrived to arrest Alvento.
[17]
 He surmised that PO3 Yaris and PO3 Bayan were humiliated because other police officers had step in to effect the arrest of Alvento which they were supposed to perform.
[18]
 PO3 Yaris and PO3 Bayan took the incident against him personally.
Thereafter, on July 3, 2013, around 11 o'clock in the evening, he was on his way home when PO3 Yaris and PO3 Bayan, on board a motorcycle, suddenly stopped near him. PO3 Bayan placed his hands inside his pockets and claimed that he recovered something therefrom. The policemen brought him to the precinct and boxed him in the abdomen before taking him to the City Health Office the next day.
He maintained that he only had a lighter, a cellular phone, one (1) Php500 bill, and five (5) Php100 bills in his possession at that time;
[19]
 PO3 Yaris planted the supposed buy-bust money in his pocket. He recognized the Php1,000.00 marked bill as part of the original Php2,000 boodle money given to him by PO3 Yaris for the entrapment operation against Alvento.
[20]
The Trial Court's Ruling
As borne by its Decision dated May 5, 2015,
[21]
 the trial court rendered a verdict of conviction, 
viz
:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused Edgardo Garcia guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. [9165] and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment, without eligibility of parole, and to pay the fine of P500,000.00. The period of preventive imprisonment suffered by the accused shall be credited in his favor.
The sachet of shabu subject of the case is ordered transmitted to the PDEA for proper disposition.
SO ORDERED.
[22]
It ruled that all the elements of the crime were sufficiently established, that the chain of custody was duly observed, and the 
corpus delicti
 was positively identified.
[23]
The Proceedings Before the Court of Appeals
On appeal, appellant faulted the trial court for rendering a verdict of conviction despite the prosecution's alleged procedural lapses and gaps in the chain of custody, 
viz
:
First
, after the purported transaction, PO3 Yaris placed the seized item in his pocket without marking the same, casting doubt on the identity of the corpus delicti;
[24]
Second
, the police officers did not testify on how the specimen was preserved and safeguarded during and after its laboratory examination;
[25]
Third
, the evidence custodian to whom the item was allegedly endorsed after examination was neither identified nor presented;
[26]
Fourth
, no representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ) was present during the conduct of inventory and photography of the seized items;
[27]
Finally
, Valdez testified that he was not sure if the items inventoried were actually recovered from appellant.
[28]
The Office of the Solicitor General, through Assistant Solicitor General Renan E. Ramos and Associate Solicitor III Analyn G. Avila defended the verdict of conviction.
[29]
 It argued that all the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs were established by testimonial, documentary and object evidence; the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved; and the 
corpus delicti
 was identified in open court.
[30]
More, the totality of evidence showed that the chain of custody was not broken. PO3 Yaris testified that he arrested appellant and seized items from him following a buy-bust operation; conducted the inventory of the seized items in the presence of media representative Valdez and 
Punong Barangay
 Lim; prepared the inventory which Valdez and Lim signed while PO2 Bermudez took photographs; prepared the request for laboratory examination; and turned over the documents and sachet to Regional Crime Laboratory Office 1. These led to the indubitable conclusion that the identity and integrity of the 
corpus delicti
 were preserved.
[31]
Finally, appellant's defenses of denial and frame-up failed against the evidence of the prosecution. Police officers were presumed to have acted regularly in the performance of their official functions, absent any proof to the contrary.
[32]
The Court of Appeals' Ruling
By Decision dated September 30, 2016, the Court of Appeals affirmed.
[33]
 It found that all the elements of the crime were present and appellant was positively identified in open court as the subject of the buy-bust operation. More, appellant raised the alleged broken chain of custody for the first time on appeal. At any rate, the chain of custody was substantially complied with and the
 corpus delicti 
was established with certainty.
[34]
 Finally, appellant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to substantiate his defense of denial and frame-up; the presumption of regularity of performance of official duties therefore prevailed.
[35]
The Present Appeal
Appellant now asks the Court for a verdict of acquittal.
[36]
In compliance with Resolution dated June 28, 2017, both appellant and the OSG manifested that in lieu of supplemental briefs, they were adopting their respective briefs before the Court of Appeals.
[37]
Issue
Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial court's verdict of conviction despite the attendant procedural deficiencies relative to the chain of custody over the 
corpus delicti
!
Ruling
We acquit.
In criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review.
[38]
 Thus, even if appellant challenged the arresting officers' compliance with the chain of custody rule first time on appeal, the Court is not barred from reviewing whether there was indeed unjustified deviation from the rule.
Petitioner was charged with unauthorized sale of dangerous drug allegedly committed on July 4, 2013. The governing law, therefore, is RA 9165. Section 21 of which prescribes the standard in preserving the 
corpus delicti
 in illegal drug cases, 
viz
:
Section 21. C
ustody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.
 - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:
(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, 
immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;
 (emphasis added)
xxxx
The Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 further commands:
Section 21.
 (a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, 
a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ
), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items, (emphasis added)
To ensure the integrity of the seized drug item, the prosecution must account for each link in its chain of custody:
[39]
 
first
, the seizure and marking of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; 
second
, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; 
third
, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and 
fourth
, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.
[40]
This is the chain of custody rule. It came to fore due to the unique characteristics of illegal drugs which render them indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to tampering, alteration or substitution either by accident or otherwise.
[41]
Records show that the arresting officers here had repeatedly breached the chain of custody rule.

Q 
 
When you said that you did not see the conduct of the body search you don't know if those items which were listed in the [Certificate] of Inventory were really those items which were recovered from the possession of the accused?

I saw them before I signed...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
My question Mr. witness is that, you said that you were not around during the conduct of the body search upon the person of Edgardo Garcia, correct?
 
 
 
A 
 
Yes [ma'am].
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
So those items that were listed in the [Certificate] of Inventory you are not sure if these are the items which were recovered from the accused, is that correct Mr. witness?
 
 
 
A 
 
Yes [ma'am].
[46]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
xxxx
 
 
 
First
, as admitted by the prosecution witnesses themselves, the seized item was not immediately marked upon the arrest of appellant. The Court held in 
People v. Ramirez
[47]
 that marking of the seized item immediately after seizure is vital to ensure its integrity and veracity by preventing switching, planting, or contamination of evidence.
[48]
Here, PO3 Yaris testified to placing the seized item in his pocket without marking them immediately upon confiscation. The marking was only done when Valdez and Lim arrived around ten (10) minutes following appellant's arrest. During this ten (10)-minute interval, the 
corpus delicti
 remained in PO3 Yaris' pocket without any way of differentiating it from other drug items that may have been in PO3 Yaris' possession, too, at that time. This cast serious doubt on the identity of the item that was later marked and inventoried. For we cannot foreclose the possibility that what PO3 Yaris retrieved from his pocket was the same item allegedly sold by appellant. Even media representative Valdez admitted that he was unsure of the integrity of the 
corpus delicti.
Thus, the rationale behind the marking requirement was defeated when PO3 Yaris placed the 
corpus delicti
 in his pocket for ten (10) minutes before marking it. The arresting officers failed to guarantee that what PO3 Yaris recovered from his pocket and eventually marked was the same drug item he supposedly received from appellant during the buy-bust operation.
Second
, there was no representative from the DOJ to witness the physical inventory and photograph of the seized items. No valid reason was offered for this omission. PO3 Yaris merely testified that they did not even bother contacting a DOJ representative because it was already early morning.
[49]
In rendering an acquittal, the Court held in 
People v. Lim
[50]
 that mere statements of unavailability of the required witnesses, by themselves do not excuse non-compliance with Section 21, RA 9165. It is still necessary for the prosecution to establish that earnest efforts were made to secure the presence of the required witnesses.
Finally
, the prosecution did not present any witness to testify on how the forensic chemist handled the specimen during laboratory examination and how the evidence custodian preserved it thereafter. In 
People v. Ubungen
,
[51]
 the Court ruled that absent any testimony on the management, storage, and preservation of the seized illegal drug, the fourth link in the chain of custody could not be reasonably established.
Indeed, the chain of custody was broken from its incipience until its final stages. Although a saving clause in the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 allows deviation from established protocol, this is subject to the condition that justifiable grounds exist and "so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved."
[52]
 Here, since the arresting officers offered no valid explanation for the procedural deficiencies, the saving clause cannot be validly invoked, barring the proviso from coming into play.
Suffice it to state that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions
[53]
 cannot substitute for compliance in an attempt to reconnect the broken links. For it is a mere disputable presumption that cannot prevail over clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
[54]
 And here, the presumption was amply overturned, nay, overthrown by compelling evidence on record of the repeated breach of the chain of custody rule. Verily, a verdict of acquittal is in order.
ACCORDINGLY
, the appeal is 
GRANTED
. The Decision dated September 30, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R CR-H.C. No. 07526 is 
REVERSED

 SET ASIDE.
