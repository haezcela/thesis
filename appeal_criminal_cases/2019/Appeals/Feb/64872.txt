DEL CASTILLO, J.:


Paradise is a place of bliss, felicity, and delight.
[1]
 For Filipinos and foreign nationals alike, Boracay - a small island in Malay, Aklan, with its palm-fringed, pristine white sand beaches, azure waters, coral reefs, rare seashells,
[2]
 and a lot more to offer,
[3]
 - is indeed a piece of paradise. Unsurprisingly, Boracay is one of the country's prime tourist destinations. However, this island-paradise has been disrespected, abused, degraded, over-used, and taken advantage of by both locals and tourists. Hence, the government gave Boracay its much-needed respite and rehabilitation. However, the process by which the rehabilitation was to be implemented did not sit well with petitioners, hence, the present petition.
 
The Case
 
Before this Court is a Petition for Prohibition and Mandamus with Application for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction, and/or Status
 Quo Ante
 Order filed by petitioners Mark Anthony V. Zabal (Zabal), Thiting Estoso Jacosalem (Jacosalem), and Odon S. Bandiola (Bandiola) against respondents President Rodrigo R. Duterte (President Duterte), Executive Secretary Salvador C. Medialdea, and Secretary Eduardo M. AÃ±o of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG). 
The Parties
 
Zabal and Jacosalem are both residents of Boracay who, at the time of the filing of the petition, were earning a living from the tourist activities therein. Zabal claims to build sandcastles for tourists while Jacosalem drives for tourists and workers in the island. While not a resident, Bandiola, for his part, claims to occasionally visit Boracay for business and pleasure. The three base their
 locus standi
 on direct injury and also from the transcendental importance doctrine.
[4]
 Respondents, on the other hand, are being sued in their capacity as officials of the government. 
 
The Facts
 
 Claiming that Boracay has become a cesspool, President Duterte first made public his plan to shut it down during a business forum held in Davao sometime February 2018.
[5]
 This was followed by several speeches and news releases stating that he would place Boracay under a state of calamity. True to his words, President Duterte ordered the shutting down of the island in a cabinet meeting held on April 4, 2018. This was confirmed by then Presidential Spokesperson Harry L. Roque, Jr. in a press briefing the following day wherein he formally announced that the total closure of Boracay would be for a maximum period of six months starting April 26, 2018.
[6]
 Following this pronouncement, petitioners contend that around 630 police and military personnel were readily deployed to Boracay including personnel for crowd dispersal management.
[7]
 They also allege that the DILG had already released guidelines for the closure.
[8]
 Petitioners claim that ever since the news of Boracay's closure came about, fewer tourists had been engaging the services of Zabal and Jacosalem such that their earnings were barely enough to feed their families. They fear that if the closure pushes through, they would suffer grave and irreparable damage. Hence, despite the fact that the government was then yet to release a formal issuance on the matter,
[9]
 petitioners filed the petition on April 25, 2018 praying that: 
 
 
 
(a)
 
Upon the filing of [the] petition, a TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER (TRO) and/or a WRIT OF PRELIMINARY PROHIBITORY INJUNCTION be immediately issued RESTRAINING and/or ENJOINING the respondents, and all persons acting under their command, order, and responsibility from enforcing a closure of Boracay Island or from banning the petitioners, tourists, and non-residents therefrom, and a WRIT OF PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTION directing the respondents, and all persons acting under their command, order, and responsibility to ALLOW all of the said persons to enter and/or leave Boracay Island unimpeded;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b)
 
In the alternative, if the respondents enforce the closure after the instant petition is filed, that a STATUS QUO ANTE Order be issued restoring and maintaining the condition prior to such closure;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c)
 
After proper proceedings, a judgment be rendered PERMANENTLY RESTRAINING and/or ENJOINING the respondents, and all persons acting under their command, order, and responsibility from enforcing a closure of Boracay Island or from banning the petitioners, tourists, and non-residents therefrom, and further DECLARING the closure of Boracay Island or the ban against petitioners, tourists, and non-residents therefrom to be UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
 
 
 
Other reliefs just and equitable under the premises are similarly prayed for.
[10]
 
 
On May 18, 2018, petitioners filed a Supplemental Petition
[11]
 stating that the day following the filing of their original petition or on April 26, 2018, President Duterte issued Proclamation No. 475
[12]
 formally declaring a state of calamity in Boracay and ordering its closure for six months from April 26, 2018 to October 25, 2018. The closure was implemented on even date. Thus, in addition to what they prayed for in their original petition, petitioners implore the Court to declare as unconstitutional Proclamation No. 475 insofar as it orders the closure of Boracay and ban of tourists and nonÂ­residents therefrom.
[13]
 
 In the Resolutions dated April 26, 2018
[14]
 and June 5, 2018,
[15]
 the Court required respondents to file their Comment on the Petition and the Supplemental Petition, respectively. Respondents filed their Consolidated Comment
[16]
 on July 30, 2018 while petitioners filed their Reply
[17]
 thereto on October 12, 2018.
 On October 26, 2018, Boracay was reopened to tourism.
 
Petitioners' Arguments
 Petitioners state that a petition for prohibition is the appropriate remedy to raise constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit or nullify, when proper, acts of legislative and executive officials. An action for 
mandamus
, on the other hand, lies against a respondent who unlawfully excludes another from the enjoyment of an entitled right or office. Justifying their resort to prohibition and 
mandamus
, petitioners assert that (1) this case presents constitutional issues, 
i.e.
, whether President Duterte acted within the scope of the powers granted him by the Constitution in ordering the closure of Boracay and, whether the measures implemented infringe upon the constitutional rights to travel and to due process of petitioners as well as of tourists and non-residents of the island; and, (2) President Duterte exercised a power legislative in nature, thus unlawfully excluding the legislative department from the assertion of such power. 
 As to the substantive aspect, petitioners argue that Proclamation No. 475 is an invalid exercise of legislative powers. They posit that its issuance is in truth a law-making exercise since the proclamation imposed a restriction on the right to travel and therefore substantially altered the relationship between the State and its people by increasing the former's power over the latter. Simply stated, petitioners posit that Proclamation No. 475 partakes of a law the issuance of which is not vested in the President. As such, Proclamation No. 475 must be struck down for being the product of an invalid exercise of legislative power.
 Likewise, petitioners argue that Proclamation No. 475 is unconstitutional for infringing on the constitutional rights to travel and to due process.
 Petitioners point out that although Section 6, Article III of the Constitution explicitly allows the impairment of the right to travel, two conditions, however, must concur to wit: (1) there is a law restricting the said right, and (2) the restriction is based on national security, public safety or public health. For petitioners, neither of these conditions have been complied with. For one, Proclamation No. 475 does not refer to any specific law restricting the right to travel. Second, it has not been shown that the presence of tourists in the island poses any threat or danger to national security, public safety or public health.
 As to the right to due process, petitioners aver that the same covers property rights and these include the right to work and earn a living. Since the government, through Proclamation No. 475, restricted the entry of tourists and non-residents into the island, petitioners claim that they, as well as all others who work, do business, or earn a living in the island, were deprived of the source of their livelihood as a result thereof. Their right to work and earn a living was curtailed by the proclamation. Moreover, while Proclamation No. 475 cites various violations of environmental laws in the island, these, for the petitioners, do not justify disregard of the rights of thousands of law-abiding people. They contend that environmental laws provide for specific penalties intended only for violators. Verily, to make those innocent of environmental transgressions suffer the consequences of the Boracay closure is tantamount to violating their right to due process.
 Petitioners likewise argue that the closure of Boracay could not be anchored on police power. For one, police power must be exercised not by the executive but by legislative bodies through the creation of statutes and ordinances that aim to promote the health, moral, peace, education, safety, and general welfare of the people. For another, the measure is unreasonably unnecessary and unduly oppressive.
 In their Supplemental Petition, petitioners aver that Proclamation No. 475 unduly impinges upon the local autonomy of affected Local Government Units (LGUs) since it orders the said LGUs to implement the closure of Boracay and the ban of tourists and non-residents therefrom. While petitioners acknowledge the President's power of supervision over LGUs, they nevertheless point out that he does not wield the power of control over them. As such, President Duterte can only call the attention of the LGUs concerned with regard to rules not being followed, which is the true essence of supervision, but he cannot lay down the rules himself as this already constitutes control. 
 Finally, petitioners state that this case does not simply revolve on the need to rehabilitate Boracay, but rather, on the extent of executive power and the manner by which it was wielded by President Duterte. To them, necessity does not justify the President's abuse of power. 
 
Respondents' Arguments
 At the outset, respondents assert that President Duterte must be dropped as party-respondent in this case because he is immune from suit. They also argue that the petition should be dismissed outright for lack of basis. According to respondents, prohibition is a preventive remedy to restrain future action. Here, President Duterte had already issued Proclamation No. 475 and in fact, the rehabilitation of the island was then already ongoing. These, according to respondents, have rendered improper the issuance of a writ of prohibition considering that as a rule, prohibition does not lie to restrain an act that is already 
fait accompli
. Neither is 
mandamus
 proper. Section 3, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides that a 
mandamus
 petition may be resorted to when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. Respondents argue that 
mandamus
 will not lie in this case because they were not neglectful of their duty to protect the environment; on the contrary, they conscientiously performed what they were supposed to do by ordering the closure of Boracay to give way to its rehabilitation. Thus, to them, 
mandamus
 is obviously inappropriate. 
 At any rate, respondents contend that there is no real justiciable controversy in this case. They see no clash between the right of the State to preserve and protect its natural resources and the right of petitioners to earn a living. Proclamation No. 475 does not prohibit anyone from being gainfully employed. 
 Respondents moreover maintain that the petition is in the nature of a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) under Rule 6 of A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC or the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, or a legal action filed to harass, vex, exert undue pressure or stifle any legal recourse that any person, institution or the government has taken or may take in the enforcement of environmental laws, protection of the environment or assertion of environmental rights. Respondents thus assert that the petition must be dismissed since it was filed for the said sole purpose. 
 With regard to the substantive aspect, respondents contend that the issuance of Proclamation No. 475 is a valid exercise of delegated legislative power, it being anchored on Section 16 of Republic Act (RA) No. 10121, otherwise known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010, or the authority given to the President to declare a state of calamity, 
viz
.: 
 
 SECTION 16. 
Declaration of State of Calamity
. - The National Council shall recommend to the President of the Philippines the declaration of a cluster of barangays, municipalities, cities, provinces, and regions under a state of calamity, and the lifting thereof, based on the criteria set by the National Council. The President's declaration may warrant international humanitarian assistance as deemed necessary.

 They likewise contend that Proclamation No. 475 was issued pursuant to the President's executive power under Section 1, Article VII of the Constitution. As generally defined, executive power is the power to enforce and administer laws. It is the power of implementing the laws and enforcing their due observance. And in order to effectively discharge the enforcement and administration of the laws, the President is granted administrative power over bureaus and offices, which includes the power of control. The power of control, in turn, refers to the authority to direct the performance of a duty, restrain the commission of acts, review, approve, reverse or modify acts and decisions of subordinate officials or units, and prescribe standards, guidelines, plans and programs. Respondents allege that President Duterte's issuance of Proclamation No. 475 was precipitated by his approval of the recommendation of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) to place Boracay under a state of calamity. By giving his 
imprimatur,
 it is clear that the President merely exercised his power of control over the executive branch. 
 In any case, respondents assert that the President has residual powers which are implied from the grant of executive power and which are necessary for him to comply with his duties under the Constitution as held in the case of 
Marcos v. Manglapus
.
[18]
 
 In sum, respondents emphasize that the issuance of Proclamation No. 475 is within the ambit of the powers of the President, not contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers, and in accordance with the mechanism laid out by the Constitution. 
 Further, respondents dispute petitioners' allegation that Proclamation No. 475 infringes upon the rights to travel and to due process. They emphasize that the right to travel is not an absolute right. It may be impaired or restricted in the interest of national security, public safety, or public health. In fact, there are already several existing laws which serve as statutory limitations to the right to travel. 
 Anent the alleged violation of the right to due process, respondents challenge petitioners' claim that they were deprived of their livelihood without due process. Respondents call attention to the fact that Zabal as sandcastle maker and Jacosalem as driver are freelancers and thus belong to the informal economy sector. This means that their source of livelihood is never guaranteed and is susceptible to changes in regulations and the over-all business climate. In any case, petitioners' contentions must yield to the State's exercise of police power. As held in 
Ermita-Malate Hotel & Motel Operators Association, Inc. v. The Hon. City Mayor of Manila
,
[19]
 the mere fact that some individuals in the community may be deprived of their present business or of a particular mode of living cannot prevent the exercise of the police power of the State. Indeed, to respondents, private interests should yield to the reasonable prerogatives of the State for the public good and welfare, which precisely are the primary objectives of the government measure herein questioned 
 Lastly, respondents insist that Proclamation No. 475 does not unduly transgress upon the local autonomy of the LGUs concerned. Under RA 10121, it is actually the Local Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council concerned which, subject to several criteria, is tasked to take the lead in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from the effects of any disaster when a state of calamity is declared. In any case, the devolution of powers upon LGUs pursuant to the constitutional mandate of ensuring their autonomy does not mean that the State can no longer interfere in their affairs. This is especially true in this case since Boracay's environmental disaster cannot be treated as a localized problem that can be resolved by the concerned LGUs only. The magnitude and gravity of the problem require the intervention and assistance of different national government agencies in coordination with the concerned LGUs. 
 As a final point, respondents aver that the bottom line of petitioners' lengthy discourse and constitutional posturing is their intention to re-open Boracay to tourists and non-residents for the then remainder of the duration of the closure and thus perpetuate and further aggravate the island's environmental degradation. Respondents posit that this is unacceptable since Boracay cannot be sacrificed for the sake of profit and personal convenience of the few. 
 
Our Ruling
 
 First, we discuss the procedural issues. 
 
 
President Duterte is dropped as respondent in this case
 
 
 
 
As correctly pointed out by respondents, President Duterte must be dropped as respondent in this case. The Court's pronouncement in 
Professor David v. President Macapagal-Arroyo
[20]
 on the non-suability of an incumbent President cannot be any clearer, 
viz
.: 
 
 x x x Settled is the doctrine that the President, during his tenure of office or actual incumbency, may not be sued in any civil or criminal case, and there is no need to provide for it in the Constitution or law. It will degrade the dignity of the high office of the President, the Head of State, if he can be dragged into court litigations while serving as such. Furthermore, it is important that he be freed from any form of harassment, hindrance or distraction to enable him to fully attend to the performance of his official duties and functions. Unlike the legislative and judicial branch, only one constitutes the executive branch and anything which impairs his usefulness in the discharge of the many great and important duties imposed upon him by the Constitution necessarily impairs the operation of the Government.
[21]
 
 
 Accordingly, President Duterte is dropped as respondent in this case. 
Propriety of Prohibition and Mandamus
 
 Section 2, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides for a petition for prohibition as follows: 
 
 SEC. 2. 
Petition for prohibition
. â When the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, are without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent to desist from further proceedings in the action or matter specified therein, or otherwise granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require. 
 
 x x x x
 
 
 "Indeed, prohibition is a preventive remedy seeking that a judgment be rendered directing the defendant to desist from continuing with the commission of an act perceived to be illegal. As a rule, the proper function of a writ of prohibition is to prevent the performance of an act which is about to be done. It is not intended to provide a remedy for acts already accomplished."
[22]
 
 
Mandamus
, on the other hand, is provided for by Section 3 of the same Rule 65: 
 
 SEC. 3. 
Petition for mandamus
. â When any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent, immediately or at some other time to be specified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of the respondent. 
 
 x x x x
 
 
 "As the quoted provision instructs, 
mandamus
 will lie if the tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station."
[23]
 
 It is upon the above-discussed contexts of prohibition and 
mandamus
 that respondents base their contention of improper recourse. Respondents maintain that prohibition is not proper in this case because the closure of Boracay is already a 
fait accompli
. Neither is 
mandamus
 appropriate since there is no neglect of duty on their part as they were precisely performing their duty to protect the environment when the closure was ordered. 
 Suffice it to state, however, that the use of prohibition and 
mandamus
 is not merely confined to Rule 65. These extraordinary remedies may be invoked when constitutional violations or issues are raised. As the Court stated in 
Spouses Imbong v. Hon. Ochoa, Jr
.:
[24]
 
 
 As far back as 
TaÃ±ada v. Angara
, the Court has unequivocally declared that 
certiorari
, 
prohibition and 
mandamus
 are appropriate remedies to raise constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit/nullify, when proper, acts of legislative and executive officials, as there is no other plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
 This ruling was later on applied in 
Macalintal v. COMELEC, Aldaba v. COMELEC, Magallona v. Ermita
, and countless others. In 
TaÃ±ada,
 the Court wrote: 
 
 
 In seeking to nullify an act of the Philippine Senate on the ground that it contravenes the Constitution, the petition no doubt raises a justiciable controversy. Where an action of the legislative branch is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution, it becomes not only the right but in fact the duty of the judiciary to settle the dispute. 'The question thus posed is judicial rather than political. The duty (to adjudicate) remains to assure that the supremacy of the Constitution is upheld.' Once a 'controversy as to the application or interpretation of constitutional provision is raised before this Court, as in the instant case, it becomes a legal issue which the Court is bound by constitutional mandate to decide. x x x
[25]
 (Citations omitted; emphasis supplied)
 
 
 
 It must be stressed, though, that resort to prohibition and 
mandamus
 on the basis of alleged constitutional violations is not without limitations. After all, this Court does not have unrestrained authority to rule on just about any and every claim of constitutional violation.
[26]
 The petition must be subjected to the four exacting requisites for the exercise of the power of judicial review, 
viz
.: (a) there must be an actual case or controversy; (b) the petitioners must possess 
locus standi
; (c) the question of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity; and (d) the issue of constitutionality must be the 
lis mota
 of the case.
[27]
 Hence, it is not enough that this petition mounts a constitutional challenge against Proclamation No. 475. It is likewise necessary that it meets the aforementioned requisites before the Court sustains the propriety of the recourse. 
Existence of Requisites for Judicial Review
 
 In 
La Bugal-B'laan Tribal Association, Inc. v. Sec. Ramos
,
[28]
 an actual case or controversy was characterized as a "case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for determination, not conjectural or anticipatory, lest the decision of the court would amount to an advisory opinion. The power does not extend to hypothetical questions since any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal question and to sterile conclusions unrelated to actualities."
[29]
 
 The existence of an actual controversy in this case is evident. President Duterte issued Proclamation No. 475 on April 26, 2018 and, pursuant thereto, Boracay was temporarily closed the same day. Entry of non-residents and tourists to the island was not allowed until October 25, 2018. Certainly, the implementation of the proclamation has rendered legitimate the concern of petitioners that constitutional rights may have possibly been breached by this governmental measure. It bears to state that when coupled with sufficient facts, "reasonable certainty of the occurrence of a perceived threat to any constitutional interest suffices to provide a basis for mounting a constitutional challenge".
[30]
 And while it may be argued that the reopening of Boracay has seemingly rendered moot and academic questions relating to the ban of tourists and non-residents into the island, abstention from judicial review is precluded by such possibility of constitutional violation and also by the exceptional character of the situation, the paramount public interest involved, and the fact that the case is capable of repetition.
[31]
 As to legal standing, petitioners assert that they were directly injured since their right to travel and, their right to work and earn a living which thrives solely on tourist arrivals, were affected by the closure. They likewise want to convince the Court that the issues here are of transcendental importance since according to them, the resolution of the same will have far-reaching consequences upon all persons living and working in Boracay; upon the Province of Aklan which is heavily reliant on the island's tourism industry; and upon the whole country considering that fundamental constitutional rights were allegedly breached. 
 "Legal standing or 
locus standi
 is a party's personal and substantial interest in a case such that he has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act being challenged. It calls for more than just a generalized grievance. The term 'interest' means a material interest, an interest in issue affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest."
[32]
 There must be a present substantial interest and not a mere expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest.
[33]
 
 In 
Galicto v. Aquino III,
[34]
 the therein petitioner, Jelbert B. Galicto (Galicto) questioned the constitutionality of Executive Order No. 7 (EO7) issued by President Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III, which ordered, among others, a moratorium on the increases in the salaries and other forms of compensation of all government-owned-and-controlled corporations (GOCCs) and government financial institutions. The Court held that Galicto, an employee of the GOCC Philhealth, has no legal standing to assail EO7 for his failure to demonstrate that he has a personal stake or material interest in the outcome of the case. His interest, if any, was speculative and based on a mere expectancy. Future increases in his salaries and other benefits were contingent events or expectancies to which he has no vested rights. Hence, he possessed no 
locus standi
 to question the curtailment thereof. 
 Here, as mentioned, Zabal is a sandcastle maker and Jacosalem, a driver. The nature of their livelihood is one wherein earnings are not guaranteed. As correctly pointed out by respondents, their earnings are not fixed and may vary depending on the business climate in that while they can earn much on peak seasons, it is also possible for them not to earn anything on lean seasons, especially when the rainy days set in. Zabal and Jacosalem could not have been oblivious to this kind of situation, they having been in the practice of their trade for a considerable length of time. Clearly, therefore, what Zabal and Jacosalem could lose in this case are mere projected earnings which are in no way guaranteed, and are sheer expectancies characterized as contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest, just like in 
Galicto
. Concomitantly, an assertion of direct injury on the basis of loss of income does not clothe Zabal and Jacosalem with legal standing. 
 As to Bandiola, the petition is bereft of any allegation as to his substantial interest in the case and as to how he sustained direct injury as a result of the issuance of Proclamation No. 475. While the allegation that he is a non-resident who occasionally goes to Boracay for business and pleasure may suggest that he is claiming direct injury on the premise that his right to travel was affected by the proclamation, the petition fails to expressly provide specifics as to how. "It has been held that a party who assails the constitutionality of a statute must have a direct and personal interest. [He] must show not only that the law or any governmental act is invalid, but also that [he] sustained or is in immediate danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that [he] suffers thereby in some indefinite way. [He] must show that [he] has been or is about to be denied some right or privilege to which [he] is lawfully entitled or that [he] is about to be subjected to some burdens or penalties by reason of the statute or act complained of."
[35]
 Indeed, the petition utterly fails to demonstrate that Bandiola possesses the requisite legal standing to sue. 
 Notwithstanding petitioners' lack of 
locus standi
, this Court will allow this petition to proceed to its ultimate conclusion due to its transcendental importance. After all, the rule on 
locus standi
 is a mere procedural technicality, which the Court, in a long line of cases involving subjects of transcendental importance, has waived or relaxed, thus allowing non-traditional plaintiffs such as concerned citizens, taxpayers, voters and legislators to sue in cases of public interest, albeit they may not have been personally injured by a government act.
[36]
 More importantly, the matters raised in this case, involved on one hand, possible violations of the Constitution and, on the other, the need to rehabilitate the country's prime tourist destination. Undeniably, these matters affect public interests and therefore are of transcendental importance to the people. In addition, the situation calls for review because as stated, it is capable of repetition, the Court taking judicial notice of the many other places in our country that are suffering from similar environmental degradation. 
 As to the two other requirements, their existence is indubitable. It will be recalled that even before a formal issuance on the closure of Boracay was made by the government, petitioners already brought the question of the constitutionality of the then intended closure to this Court. And, a day after Proclamation No. 475 was issued, they filed a supplemental petition impugning its constitutionality. Clearly, the filing of the petition and the supplemental petition signals the earliest opportunity that the constitutionality of the subject government measure could be raised. There can also be no denying that the very 
lis mota
 of this case is the constitutionality of Proclamation No. 475. 
 
Defense of SLAPP
 Suffice it to state that while this case touches on the environmental issues in Boracay, the ultimate issue for resolution is the constitutionality of Proclamation No. 475. The procedure in the treatment of a defense of SLAPP provided for under Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases should not, therefore, be made to apply. 
 Now as to the substantive issues. 
 We first quote in full Proclamation No. 475. 
PROCLAMATION No. 475 
 
 DECLARING A STATE OF CALAMITY IN THE BARANGAYS OF BALABAG, MANOC-MANOC AND YAPAK (ISLAND OF BORACAY) IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF MALAY, AKLAN, AND TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE ISLAND AS A TOURIST DESTINATION 
 
 WHEREAS, Section 15, Article II of the 1987 Constitution states that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them; 
 
 WHEREAS, Section 16, Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides that it is the policy of the State to protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature; 
 
 WHEREAS, Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution provides that the State shall protect the nation's marine wealth in its archipelagic waters, territorial sea, and exclusive economic zone; 
 
 WHEREAS, an Inter-Agency Task Force, composed of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the [DILG] and the Department of Tourism (DOT), was established to evaluate the environmental state of the Island of Boracay, and investigate possible violations of existing environmental and health laws, rules and regulations; 
 
 WHEREAS, the investigations and validation undertaken revealed that: 
 
 There is a high concentration of fecal coliform in the Bolabog beaches located in the eastern side of Boracay Island due to insufficient sewer lines and illegal discharge of untreated waste water into the beach, with daily tests conducted from 6 to 10 March 2018 revealing consistent failure in compliance with acceptable water standards, with an average result of 18,000 most probable number (MPN)/100ml, exceeding the standard level of 400 MPN/100ml; 
 Most commercial establishments and residences are not connected to the sewerage infrastructure of Boracay Island, and waste products are not being disposed through the proper sewerage infrastructures in violation of environmental law, rules, and regulations; 
 Only 14 out of 51 establishments near the shores of Boracay Island are compliant with the provision of Republic Act (RA) No. 9275 or the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004; 
 Dirty water results in the degradation of the coral reefs and coral cover of Boracay Island, which declined by approximately 70.5% from 1988 to 2011, with the highest decrease taking place between 2008 and 2011 during a period of increased tourist arrivals (approximately 38.4%); 
 Solid waste within Boracay Island is at a generation rate of 90 to 115 tons per day, while the hauling capacity of the local government is only 30 tons per day, hence, leaving approximately 85 tons of waste in the Island daily;
The natural habitats of Puka shells, nesting grounds of marine turtles, and roosting grounds of flying foxes or fruit bats have been damaged and/or destroyed; and 
Only four (4) out of nine (9) wetlands in Boracay Island remain due to illegal encroachment of structures, including 937 identified illegal structures constructed on forestlands and wetlands, as well as 102 illegal structures constructed on areas already classified as easements, and the disappearance of the wetlands, which acts as natural catchments, enhances flooding in the area; 
 
 
WHEREAS
, the findings of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) reveal that beach erosion is prevalent in Boracay Island, particularly along the West Beach, where as much as 40 meters of erosion has taken place in the past 20 years from 1993 to 2003, due to storms, extraction of sand along the beach to construct properties and structures along the foreshore, and discharge of waste water near the shore causing degradation of coral reefs and seagrass meadows that supply the beach with sediments and serve as buffer to wave action; 
 
 
WHEREAS
, the DOST also reports that based on the 2010-2015 Coastal Ecosystem Conservation and Adaptive Management Study of the Japan International Cooperation Agency, direct discharge of waste water near the shore has resulted in the frequent algal bloom and coral deterioration, which may reduce the source of sand and cause erosion; 
 
 
WHEREAS
, the data from the Region VI - Western Visayas Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council shows that the number of tourists in the island in a day amounts to 18,082, and the tourist arrival increased by more than 160% from 2012 to 2017; 
 
 
WHEREAS
, the continuous rise of tourist arrivals, the insufficient sewer and waste management system, and environmental violations of establishments aggravate the environmental degradation and destroy the ecological balance of the Island of Boracay, resulting in major damage to property and natural resources, as well as the disruption of the normal way of life of the people therein; 
 
 
WHEREAS
, it is necessary to implement urgent measures to address the abovementioned human-induced hazards, to protect and promote the health and well-being of its residents, workers and tourists, and to rehabilitate the Island in order to ensure the sustainability of the area and prevent further degradation of its rich ecosystem; 
 
 
WHEREAS
, RA No. 9275 provides that the DENR shall designate water bodies, or portions thereof, where specific pollutants from either natural or man-made source have already exceeded water quality guidelines as non-attainment areas for the exceeded pollutants and shall prepare and implement a program that will not allow new sources of exceeded water pollutant in non-attainment areas without a corresponding reduction in discharges from existing sources; 
 
 
WHEREAS
, RA No. 9275 also mandates the DENR, in coordination with other concerned agencies and the private sectors, to take such measures as may be necessary to upgrade the quality of such water in non-attainment areas to meet the standards under which it has been classified, and the local government units to prepare and implement contingency plans and other measures including relocation, whenever necessary, for the protection of health and welfare of the residents within potentially affected areas; 
 
 
WHEREAS
, Proclamation No. 1064 (s. 2006) classified the Island of Boracay into 377.68 hectares of reserved forest land for protection purposes and 628.96 hectares of agricultural land as alienable and disposable land; 
 
 
WHEREAS
, pursuant to the Regalian Doctrine, and as emphasized in recent jurisprudence, whereby all lands not privately owned belong to the State, the entire island of Boracay is state-owned, except for lands already covered by existing valid titles; 
 
 
WHEREAS
, pursuant to RA No. 10121, or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council has recommended the declaration of a State of Calamity in the Island of Boracay and the temporary closure of the Island as a tourist destination to ensure public safety and public health, and to assist the government in its expeditious rehabilitation, as well as in addressing the evolving socio-economic needs of affected communities; 
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE
, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution and existing laws, do hereby declare a State of Calamity in the barangays of Balabag, Manoc-Manoc and Yapak (Island of Boracay) in the Municipality of Malay, Aklan. In this regard, the temporary closure of the Island as a tourist destination for six (6) months starting 26 April 2018, or until 25 October 2018, is hereby ordered subject to applicable laws, rules, regulations and jurisprudence. 
 
 Concerned government agencies shall, as may be necessary or appropriate, undertake the remedial measures during a State of Calamity as provided in RA No. 10121 and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, such as control of the prices of basic goods and commodities for the affected areas, employment of negotiated procurement and utilization of appropriate funds, including the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund, for relief and rehabilitation efforts in the area. All departments and other concerned government agencies are also hereby directed to coordinate with, and provide or augment the basic services and facilities of affected local government units, if necessary. 
 
 The State of Calamity in the Island of Boracay shall remain in force and effect until lifted by the President, notwithstanding the lapse of the six-month closure period. 
 
 All departments, agencies and offices, including government-owned or controlled corporations and affected local government units are hereby directed to implement and execute the abovementioned closure and the appropriate rehabilitation works, in accordance with pertinent operational plans and directives, including the Boracay Action Plan. 
 
 The Philippine National Police, Philippine Coast Guard and other law enforcement agencies, with the support of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, are hereby directed to act with restraint and within the bounds of the law in the strict implementation of the closure of the Island and ensuring peace and order in the area. 
 
 The Municipality of Malay, Aklan is also hereby directed to ensure that no tourist will be allowed entry to the island of Boracay until such time that the closure has been lifted by the President. 
 
 All tourists, residents and establishment owners in the area are also urged to act within the bounds of the law and to comply with the directives herein provided for the rehabilitation and restoration of the ecological balance of the Island which will be for the benefit of all concerned. 
 
 
 It must be noted at the outset that petitioners failed to present and establish the factual bases of their arguments because they went directly to this Court. In ruling on the substantive issues in this case, the Court is, thus, constrained to rely on, and uphold the factual bases, which prompted the issuance of the challenged proclamation, as asserted by respondents. Besides, executive determinations, such as said factual bases, are generally final on this Court.
[37]
 
 The Court observes that the meat of petitioners' constitutional challenge on Proclamation No. 475 is the right to travel. 
 Clearly then, the one crucial question that needs to be preliminarily answered is - 
does Proclamation No. 475 constitute an impairment on the right to travel?
 
 The Court answers in the negative. 
 
 
Proclamation No. 475 does not pose an actual impairment on the right to travel
 
 
 
 
Petitioners claim that Proclamation No. 475 impairs the right to travel based on the following provisions: 
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE,
 President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution and existing laws, do hereby declare a State of Calamity in the barangays of Balabag, Manoc-Manoc and Yapak (Island of Boracay) in the Municipality of Malay, Aklan. In this regard, 
the temporary closure of the Island as a tourist destination for six (6) months starting 26 April 2018, or until 25 October 2018, is hereby ordered
 subject to applicable laws, rules, regulations and jurisprudence. 
 
 x x x x
 
 The Municipality of Malay, Aklan is also hereby directed to ensure that 
no tourist will be allowed entry to the island of Boracay
 until such time that the closure has been lifted by the President.

 The activities proposed to be undertaken to rehabilitate Boracay involved inspection, testing, demolition, relocation, and construction. These could not have been implemented freely and smoothly with tourists coming in and out of the island not only because of the possible disruption that they may cause to the works being undertaken, but primarily because their safety and convenience might be compromised. Also, the contaminated waters in the island were not just confined to a small manageable area. The excessive water pollutants were all over Bolabog beach and the numerous illegal drainpipes connected to and discharging wastewater over it originate from different parts of the island. Indeed, the activities occasioned by the necessary digging of these pipes and the isolation of the contaminated beach waters to give way to treatment could not be done in the presence of tourists. Aside from the dangers that these contaminated waters pose, hotels, inns, and other accommodations may not be available as they would all be inspected and checked to determine their compliance with environmental laws. Moreover, it bears to state that a piece-meal closure of portions of the island would not suffice since as mentioned, illegal drainpipes extend to the beach from various parts of Boracay. Also, most areas in the island needed major structural rectifications because of numerous resorts and tourism facilities which lie along easement areas, illegally reclaimed wetlands, and of forested areas that were illegally cleared for construction purposes. Hence, the need to close the island in its entirety and ban tourists therefrom. 
 In fine, this case does not actually involve the right to travel in its essential sense contrary to what petitioners want to portray. Any bearing that Proclamation No. 475 may have on the right to travel is merely corollary to the closure of Boracay and the ban of tourists and non-residents therefrom which were necessary incidents of the island's rehabilitation. There is certainly no showing that Proclamation No. 475 deliberately meant to impair the right to travel. The questioned proclamation is clearly focused on its purpose of rehabilitating Boracay and any intention to directly restrict the right cannot, in any manner, be deduced from its import. This is contrary to the import of several laws recognized as constituting an impairment on the right to travel which 
directly
 impose restriction on the right, 
viz
.: 
 
 [1] 
The Human Security Act of 2010 or Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9372.
 The law restricts the right travel of an individual charged with the crime of terrorism even though such person is out on bail. 
 
 [2] 
The Philippine Passport Act of 1996 or R.A. No. 8239
. Pursuant to said law, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs or his authorized consular officer may refuse the issuance of, restrict the use of, or withdraw, a passport of a Filipino citizen. 
 
 [3] 
Th
e 'Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003' or RA 9208.
 Pursuant to the provisions thereof, the Bureau of Immigration, in order to manage migration and curb trafficking in persons, issued Memorandum Order Radjr No. 2011-011, allowing its Travel Control and Enforcement Unit to 'offload passengers with fraudulent travel documents, doubtful purpose of travel, including possible victims of human trafficking' from our ports. 
 
 [4] 
T
he Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995 or R.A. No. 8042, as amended by R.A. No. 10022
. In enforcement of said law, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (
POEA
) may refuse to issue deployment permit[s] to a specific country that effectively prevents our migrant workers to enter such country. 
 
 [5] 
The Act on Violence Against Women and Children or R.A. No. 9262. 
The law restricts movement of an individual against whom the protection order is intended. 
 
 [6] 
Inter-Country Adoption Act of 1995 or R.A. No. 8043.
 Pursuant thereto, the Inter-Country Adoption Board may issue rules restrictive of an adoptee's right to travel 'to protect the Filipino child from abuse, exploitation, trafficking and/or sale or any other practice in connection with adoption which is harmful, detrimental, or prejudicial to the child.'
[38]
 
 
 
 In 
Philippine Association of Service Exporters, Inc. v. Hon. Drilon,
[39]
 the Court held that the consequence on the right to travel of the deployment ban implemented by virtue of Department Order No. 1, Series of 1998 of the Department of Labor and Employment does not impair the right. 
 Also significant to note is that the closure of Boracay was only temporary considering the categorical pronouncement that it was only for a definite period of six months. 
 Hence, if at all, the impact of Proclamation No. 475 on the right to travel is not direct but merely consequential; and, the same is only for a reasonably short period of time or merely temporary. 
 In this light, a discussion on whether President Duterte exercised a power legislative in nature loses its significance. Since Proclamation No. 475 does not actually impose a restriction on the right to travel, its issuance did not result to any substantial alteration of the relationship between the State and the people. The proclamation is therefore not a law and conversely, the President did not usurp the law-making power of the legislature. 
 For obvious reason, there is likewise no more need to determine the existence in this case of the requirements for a valid impairment of the right to travel. 
 
 
Even if it is otherwise, Proclamation No. 475 must be upheld for being in the nature of a valid police power measure
 
 
 
 
Police power, amongst the three fundamental and inherent powers of the state, is the most pervasive and comprehensive.
[40]
 "It has been defined as the 'state authority to enact legislation that may interfere with personal liberty or property in order to promote general welfare."
[41]
 "As defined, it consists of (1) imposition or restraint upon liberty or property, (2) in order to foster the common good. It is not capable of exact definition but has been purposely, veiled in general terms to underscore its all-comprehensive embrace."
[42]
 The police power "finds no specific Constitutional grant for the plain reason that it does not owe its origin to the Charter"
[43]
 since "it is inborn in the very fact of statehood and sovereignty."
[44]
 It is said to be the "inherent and plenary power of the State which enables it to prohibit all things hurtful to the comfort, safety, and welfare of the society."
[45]
 Thus, police power constitutes an implied limitation on the Bill of Rights.
[46]
 After all, "the Bill of Rights itself does not purport to be an absolute guaranty of individual rights and liberties. 'Even liberty itself, the greatest of all rights, is not unrestricted license to act according to one's will.' It is subject to the far more overriding demands and requirements of the greater number."
[47]
 
 "Expansive and extensive as its reach may be, police power is not a force without limits."
[48]
 "It has to be exercised within bounds â lawful ends through lawful means, 
i.e.
, that the interests of the public generally, as distinguished from that of a particular class, require its exercise, and that the means employed are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose while not being unduly oppressive upon individuals."
[49]
 
 That the assailed governmental measure in this case is within the scope of police power cannot be disputed. Verily, the statutes
[50]
 from which the said measure draws authority and the constitutional provisions
[51]
 which serve as its framework are primarily concerned with the environment and health, safety, and well-being of the people, the promotion and securing of which are clearly legitimate objectives of governmental efforts and regulations. The motivating factor in the issuance of Proclamation No. 475 is without a doubt the interest of the public in general. The only question now is whether the means employed are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose and not unduly oppressive upon individuals. 
 The pressing need to implement urgent measures to rehabilitate Boracay is beyond cavil from the factual milieu that precipitated the President's issuance of Proclamation No. 475. This necessity is even made more critical and insistent by what the Court said in 
Oposa v. Hon. Factoran, Jr.
[52]
 in regard the rights to a balanced and healthful ecology and to health, which rights are likewise integral concerns in this case. 
Oposa
 warned that unless the rights to a balanced and healthful ecology and to health are given continuing importance and the State assumes its solemn obligation to preserve and protect them, the time will come that nothing will be left not only for this generation but for the generations to come as well.
[53]
 It further taught that the right to a balanced and healthful ecology carries with it the correlative duty to refrain from impairing the environment.
[54]
 
 Against the foregoing backdrop, we now pose this question: 
Was the temporary closure of Boracay as a tourist destination for six months reasonably necessary under the circumstances?
 The answer is in the affirmative. 
 As earlier noted, one of the root causes of the problems that beset Boracay was tourist influx. Tourist arrivals in the island were clearly far more than Boracay could handle. As early as 2007, the DENR had already determined this as the major cause of the catastrophic depletion of the island's biodiversity.
[55]
 Also part of the equation is the lack of commitment to effectively enforce pertinent environmental laws. Unfortunately, direct action on these matters has been so elusive that the situation reached a critical level. Hence, by then, only bold and sweeping steps were required by the situation. 
 Certainly, the closure of Boracay, albeit temporarily, gave the island its much needed breather, and likewise afforded the government the necessary leeway in its rehabilitation program. Note that apart from review, evaluation and amendment of relevant policies, the bulk of the rehabilitation activities involved inspection, testing, demolition, relocation, and construction. These works could not have easily been done with tourists present. The rehabilitation works in the first place were not simple, superficial or mere cosmetic but rather quite complicated, major, and permanent in character as they were intended to serve as long-term solutions to the problem.
[56]
 Also, time is of the essence. Every precious moment lost is to the detriment of Boracay's environment and of the health and well-being of the people thereat. Hence, any unnecessary distraction or disruption is most unwelcome. Moreover, as part of the rehabilitation efforts, operations of establishments in Boracay had to be halted in the course thereof since majority, if not all of them, need to comply with environmental and regulatory requirements in order to align themselves with the government's goal to restore Boracay into normalcy and develop its sustainability. Allowing tourists into the island while it was undergoing necessary rehabilitation would therefore be pointless as no establishment would cater to their accommodation and other needs. Besides, it could not be said that Boracay, at the time of the issuance of the questioned proclamation, was in such a physical state that would meet its purpose of being a tourist destination. For one, its beach waters could not be said to be totally safe for swimming. In any case, the closure, to emphasize, was only for a definite period of six months, 
i.e.
, from April 26, 2018 to October 25, 2018. To the mind of the Court, this period constitutes a reasonable time frame, if not to complete, but to at least put in place the necessary rehabilitation works to be done in the island. Indeed, the temporary closure of Boracay, although unprecedented and radical as it may seem, was reasonably necessary and not unduly oppressive under the circumstances. It was the most practical and realistic means of ensuring that rehabilitation works in the island are started and carried out in the most efficacious and expeditious way. Absent a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion, unreasonableness, arbitrariness or oppressiveness, the Court will not disturb the executive determination that the closure of Boracay was necessitated by the foregoing circumstances. As earlier noted, petitioners totally failed to counter the factual bases of, and justification for the challenged executive action. 
 Undoubtedly, Proclamation No. 475 is a valid police power measure. To repeat, police power constitutes an implied limitation to the Bill of Rights, and that even liberty itself, the greatest of all rights, is subject to the far more overriding demands and requirements of the greater number. 
 For the above reasons, petitioners' constitutional challenge on Proclamation No. 475 anchored on their perceived impairment of the right to travel must fail. 
 
 
Petitioners have no vested rights on their sources of income as to be entitled to due process
 
 
 
 
Petitioners argue that Proclamation No. 475 impinges on their constitutional right to due process since they were deprived of the corollary right to work and earn a living by reason of the issuance thereof. 
 Concededly, "[a] profession, trade or calling is a property right within the meaning of our constitutional guarantees. One cannot be deprived of the right to work and the right to make a living because these rights are property rights, the arbitrary and unwarranted deprivation of which normally constitutes an actionable wrong."
[57]
 Under this premise, petitioners claim that they were deprived of due process when their right to work and earn a living was taken away from them when Boracay was ordered closed as a tourist destination. It must be stressed, though, that "when the conditions so demand as determined by the legislature, property rights must bow to the primacy of police power because property rights, though sheltered by due process, must yield to general welfare."
[58]
 Otherwise, police power as an attribute to promote the common good would be diluted considerably if on the mere plea of petitioners that they will suffer loss of earnings and capital, government measures implemented pursuant to the said state power would be stymied or invalidated.
[59]
 
 In any case, petitioners, particularly Zabal and Jacosalem, cannot be said to have already acquired vested rights to their sources of income in Boracay. As heretofore mentioned, they are part of the informal sector of the economy where earnings are not guaranteed. In 
Southern Luzon Drug Corporation v. Department of Social Welfare and Development
,
[60]
 the Court elucidated on vested rights, as follows: 
 
 x x x Vested rights are 'fixed, unalterable, or irrevocable.' More extensively, they are depicted as follows: 
 
 
 Rights which have so completely and definitely accrued to or settled in a person that they are not subject to be defeated or cancelled by the act of any other private person, and which it is right and equitable that the government should recognize and protect, as being lawful in themselves, and settled according to the then current rules of law, and of which the individual could not be deprived arbitrarily without injustice, or of which he could not justly be deprived otherwise than by the established methods of procedure and for the public welfare. x x x A right is not 'vested' unless it is more than a mere expectancy based on the anticipated continuance of present laws; it must be an established interest in property, not open to doubt. x x x To be vested in its accurate legal sense, a right must be complete and consummated, and one of which the person to whom it belongs cannot be divested without his consent. x x x
[61]
 
 
 
 Here, Zabal and Jacosalem's asserted right to whatever they may earn from tourist arrivals in Boracay is merely an inchoate right or one that has not fully developed and therefore cannot be claimed as one's own. An inchoate right is a mere expectation, which may or may not come into fruition. "It is contingent as it only comes 'into existence on an event or condition which may not happen or be performed until some other event may prevent their vesting."'
[62]
 Clearly, said petitioners' earnings are contingent in that, even assuming tourists are still allowed in the island, they will still earn nothing if no one avails of their services. Certainly, they do not possess any vested right on their sources of income, and under this context, their claim of lack of due process collapses. To stress, only rights which have completely and definitely accrued and settled are entitled protection under the due process clause. 
 Besides, Proclamation No. 475 does not strip Zabal and Jacosalem of their right to work and earn a living. They are free to work and practice their trade elsewhere. That they were not able to do so in Boracay, at least for the duration of its closure, is a necessary consequence of the police power measure to close and rehabilitate the island. 
 Also clearly untenable is petitioners' claim that they were being made to suffer the consequences of the environmental transgressions of others. It must be stressed that the temporary closure of Boracay as a tourist destination and the consequent ban of tourists into the island were not meant to serve as penalty to violators of environmental laws. The temporary closure does not erase the environmental violations committed; hence, the liabilities of the violators remain and only they alone shall suffer the same. The temporary inconvenience that petitioners or other persons may have experienced or are experiencing is but the consequence of the police measure intended to attain a much higher purpose, that is, to protect the environment, the health of the people, and the general welfare. Indeed, any and all persons may be burdened by measures intended for the common good or to serve some important governmental interest.
[63]
 
 
 
No intrusion into the autonomy of the concerned LGUs
 
 
 
 
The alleged intrusion of the President into the autonomy of the LGUs concerned is likewise too trivial to merit this Court's consideration. Contrary to petitioners' argument, RA 10121 recognizes and even puts a premium on the role of the LGUs in disaster risk reduction and management as shown by the fact that a number of the legislative policies set out in the subject statute recognize and aim to strengthen the powers decentralized to LGUs.
[64]
 This role is echoed in the questioned proclamation. 
 The fact that other government agencies are involved in the rehabilitation works does not create the inference that the powers and functions of the LGUs are being encroached upon. The respective roles of each government agency are particularly defined and enumerated in Executive Order No. 53
[65]
 and all are in accordance with their respective mandates. Also, the situation in Boracay can in no wise be characterized or labelled as a mere local issue as to leave its rehabilitation to local actors. Boracay is a prime tourist destination which caters to both local and foreign tourists. Any issue thereat has corresponding effects, direct or otherwise, at a national level. This, for one, reasonably takes the issues therein from a level that concerns only the local officials. At any rate, notice must be taken of the fact that even if the concerned LGUs have long been fully aware of the problems afflicting Boracay, they failed to effectively remedy it. Yet still, in recognition of their mandated roles and involvement in the rehabilitation of Boracay, Proclamation No. 475 directed â
[a]ll departments, agencies and offices, including government-owned or controlled corporations and 
affected local government units
 x x x to implement and execute x x x the closure [of Boracay] and the appropriate rehabilitation works, in accordance with pertinent operational plans and directives, including the Boracay Action Plan.
 "
 As a final note, the Court in 
Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Concerned Residents of Manila Bay
,
[66]
 called out the concerned government agencies for their cavalier attitude towards solving environmental destruction despite hard evidence and clear signs of climate crisis. It equated the failure to put environmental protection on a plane of high national priority to the then lacking level of bureaucratic efficiency and commitment. Hence, the Court therein took it upon itself to put the heads of concerned department-agencies and the bureaus and offices under them on continuing notice and to enjoin them to perform their mandates and duties towards the clean-up and/or restoration of Manila Bay, through a "continuing 
mandamus
." It likewise took the occasion to state, 
viz
.: 
 
 In the light of the ongoing environmental degradation, the Court wishes to emphasize the extreme necessity for all concerned executive departments and agencies to immediately act and discharge their respective official duties and obligations. Indeed, time is of the essence; hence, there is a need to set timetables for the performance and completion of the tasks, some of them as defined for them by law and the nature of their respective offices and mandates.
 
 The importance of the Manila Bay as a sea resource, playground and as a historical landmark cannot be over-emphasized. It is not yet too late in the day to restore the Manila Bay to its former splendor and bring back the plants and sea life that once thrived in its blue waters. But the tasks ahead, daunting as they may be, could only be accomplished if those mandated, with the help and cooperation of all civic-minded individuals, would put their minds to these tasks and take responsibility. This means that the State, through [the concerned department-agencies], has to take the lead in the preservation and protection of the Manila Bay. 
 
 The era of delays, procrastination, and 
ad hoc
 measures is over. [The concerned department-agencies] must transcend their limitations, real or imaginary, and buckle down to work before the problem at hand becomes unmanageable. Thus, we must reiterate that different government agencies and instrumentalities cannot shirk from their mandates; they must perform their basic functions in cleaning up and rehabilitating the Manila Bay. x x x
[67]
 
 
 
 There is an obvious similarity in 
Metropolitan Manila Development Authority
 and in the present case in that both involve the restoration of key areas in the country which were once glowing with radiance and vitality but are now in shambles due to abuses and exploitation. What sets these two cases apart is that in the former, those mandated to act still needed to be enjoined in order to act. In this case, the bold and urgent action demanded by the Court in 
Metropolitan Manila Development Authority
 is now in the roll out. Still, the voice of cynicism, naysayers, and procrastinators heard during times of inaction can still be heard during this time of full action â demonstrating a classic case of "damn if you do, damn if you don't". Thus, in order for the now staunch commitment to save the environment not to fade, it behooves upon the courts to be extra cautious in invalidating government measures meant towards addressing environmental degradation. Absent any clear showing of constitutional infirmity, arbitrariness or grave abuse of discretion, these measures must be upheld and even lauded and promoted. After all, not much time is left for us to remedy the present environmental situation. To borrow from 
Oposa
, unless the State undertakes its solemn obligation to preserve the rights to a balanced and healthful ecology and advance the health of the people, "the day would not be too far when all else would be lost not only for the present generation, but also for those to come â generations which stand to inherit nothing but parched earth incapable of sustaining life."

 All told, the Court sustains the constitutionality and validity of Proclamation No. 475.

SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION




 
CARPIO, 
J
.:


 This case involves the constitutionality of Proclamation No. 475,
[1]

 declaring a state of calamity in Barangays Balabag, Manoc-Manoc and 
Yapak in 1,032-hectare Boracay Island and ordering the temporary closure
 of the island as a tourist destination for six months, starting 26 
April 2018 until 25 October 2018.

 I vote to dismiss the petition.

 Proclamation No. 475 was issued because of the environmental 
degradation and destruction of the ecological balance of Boracay Island,
 which was aggravated by the continuing rise of tourist arrivals.
[2]
 Under Section 4
[3]
 of Presidential Decree No. 1586,
[4]

 the President may declare certain areas in the country as 
environmentally critical. To pave the way for the rehabilitation of 
Boracay Island and prevent further degradation of its rich ecosystem, 
the proclamation ordered the temporary closure of the island as a 
tourist destination for six months
[5]

 during which period the government would undertake massive road, 
drainage, and sewerage construction, as well as require all 
establishments to comply with the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Code 
on Sanitation of the Philippines, Ecological Solid Waste Management Act 
of 2000, and other relevant laws. 
However, local residents of Boracay
 Island were not prohibited from entering or leaving the island during 
the rehabilitation period as the prohibition applied only to travelers 
and tourists.


 The rehabilitation of Boracay Island resulted in the closure of 
almost all of the hotels because of non-compliance with the Clean Water 
Act, Clean Air Act, National Building Code of the Philippines, Code on 
Sanitation of the Philippines, Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 
2000, and the Environmental Compliance Certificate requirement.
[6]

 The Department of Tourism suspended the accreditation of hotels and 
resorts in Boracay Island for six months to stop the disposal of 
wastewater into the seas.
[7]
 Some establishments have also built illegal structures on Boracay's wetlands and forestlands which had to be dismantled.
[8]

 Furthermore, some companies were operating without Environmental 
Compliance Certificate (ECC), in violation of Presidential Decree No. 
1586 which established the Environmental Impact Statement System.
[9]


 Swimming in the waters of Boracay Island was generally not allowed during the six-month rehabilitation period.
[10]

 The illegal discharge of untreated wastewater into the sea and the 
insufficient sewerage system caused the high concentration of fecal 
coliform in some of the beaches in Boracay Island.
[11]
 The extremely high level of coliform bacteria which reached 47,460 mpn (most probable number) per 100 ml.
[12]

 of water sample was alarming considering that the safe level for 
swimming and other activities is just 1,000 mpn/100ml. of water sample.
[13]

 Thus, the ban on swimming imposed by the government was justified and 
necessary considering the high coliform level in the waters of Boracay 
Island, which was clearly unsafe for swimming and posed serious health 
and sanitation hazards.
[14]


 Many roads were closed for rehabilitation, widening, and 
construction, including the main road network which is the primary 
access to many establishments in the island.
[15]

 Not only were the roads widened, sewage pipes were also laid to prevent
 sewage from flowing into the beach waters, and drainage pipes were 
installed to prevent clogged waterways which caused flooding before the 
closure.
[16]
 As such, 
traveling around Boracay Island was severely restricted even for the 
local residents. Under Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 548,
[17]

 "[national] roads may be temporarily closed to any or all classes of 
traffic by the Director of Public Works or his duly authorized 
representative whenever the condition of the road or the traffic thereon
 makes such action necessary or advisable in the public interest, or for
 a specified period, with the approval of the Secretary of Public Works 
and Communications."

 The rehabilitation of Boracay Island as a consequence of 
Proclamation No. 475, declaring a state of calamity in Boracay Island, 
resulted in: (1) the closure of majority of the hotels and other 
business establishments for non-compliance with environmental laws; (2) 
the closure of many roads for repair, widening, and installation of 
drainage pipes; and (3) the ban on swimming in the beaches of Boracay 
Island due to the unsafe level of coliform bacteria.

 Given such a situation in Boracay Island, the invocation on 
behalf of non-residents of Boracay Island of the right to travel, which 
includes the right to move freely within the country,
[18]

 is misplaced. First, the valid closure of roads severely restricted 
movement around the island. Second, the closure of hotels and 
establishments pending investigation and accreditation left tourists and
 non-locals with no accommodations. Third, the valid ban on swimming in 
Boracay beaches for sanitary and health considerations made unavailable 
the main tourist attraction of Boracay Island.

 Clearly, the condition of Boracay Island during the six-month 
rehabilitation period justified the prohibition on travelers and 
tourists from entering Boracay Island because of the physical impediment
 to traveling around the island resulting from the massive road, 
sewerage and drainage construction, the lack of accommodations, and the 
ban on swimming and other water recreational activities. Thus, 
Proclamation No. 475 is a valid exercise of various existing laws, that 
is, Presidential Decree No. 1586, Commonwealth Act No. 548, Clean Water 
Act of 2004 (Republic Act No. 9275), Clean Air Act of 1999 (Republic Act
 No. 8749), National Building Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 
6541), Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 (Republic Act No. 
9003), and the Code on Sanitation of the Philippines (Presidential 
Decree No. 856). These are laws pursuant to the police power of the 
state. There is no claim that these laws are unconstitutional. The 
President, in the exercise of his control over the Executive branch of 
government,
[19]
 can directly exercise the functions of   subordinate officials tasked to implement these laws.

 Accordingly, I vote to 
DISMISS
 the petition.

 The WHEREAS clauses of
 Proclamation No. 475 cites the result of the evaluation and 
investigation of the Inter-Agency Task Force composed of the DENR, DILG,
 and DOT, which revealed, among others,	(1) high concentration of fecal 
coliform in some of the beaches in Boracay; (2) insufficient sewer and 
waste management system resulting in improper disposal of waste 
products, including discharge of waste water near the shores; (3) 937 
illegal structures constructed on forestlands and wetlands, as well as 
102 illegal structures on areas classified as easements.

 Section 4. 
Presidential Proclamation of Environmentally Critical Areas and Projects.

 â The President of the Philippines may, on his own initiative or upon 
recommendation of the National Environmental Protection Council, by 
proclamation declare certain projects, undertakings or areas in the 
country as environmentally critical. No person, partnership or 
corporation shall undertake or operate any such declared environmentally
 critical project or area without first securing an Environmental 
Compliance Certificate issued by the President or his duly authorized 
representative. For the proper management of said critical project or 
area, the President may by his proclamation reorganize such government 
offices, agencies, institutions, corporations or instrumentalities 
including the re-alignment of government personnel, and their specific 
functions and responsibilities.

 For the same purpose as above, the Ministry of Human Settlements
 shall: (a) prepare the proper land or water use pattern for said 
critical project(s) or area(s); (b) establish ambient environmental 
quality standards; (c) develop a program of environmental enhancement or
 protective measures against calamitous factors such as earthquake, 
floods, water erosion and others, and (d) perform such other functions 
as may be directed by the President from time to time.

SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION 


 PERLAS-BERNABE, 
J
.:


 I concur. 
 Among other points, I agree with the 
ponencia

 that "this case does not actually involve the right to travel in its 
essential sense contrary to what petitioners want to portray."
[1]
 In my view, there can be no violation of the right to travel because, in the first place, Proclamation No. 475
[2]
 is not an issuance that substantively regulates such right.
 To expound, the right to travel has been regarded as integral to personal liberty,
[3]
 which Blackstone defines as "freedom from 
restraint of the person
."
[4]
 The guarantee of free movement may be historically traced
[5]
 to the Magna Carta of 1215 which assured the liberty for 
anyone
,
 except those imprisoned, outlawed, and the natives of an enemy country,
 safe and secure entry to and exit from England. It likewise assured 
merchants
, that they may enter, leave, stay, and move about England "unharmed and without fear."
[6]
 Much later, or in 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) recognized 
everyone's
 right to freedom of movement within the borders of each state, as well as the one's right to leave and return to his country.
[7]
 The guarantee was likewise incorporated in the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
[8]
 which the Philippines signed in the same year.
[9]
 This guarantee was incorporated in our fundamental law in the 1973 Constitution,
[10]
 and now appears in the 1987 Constitution.
[11]

 An examination of local cases wherein the right to travel was involved 
will support the premise that the right to travel â if one were to 
understand the same in its proper sense â ought to pertain to government
 regulations that directly affect the individual's freedom of locomotion
 or movement. For instance, in 
Samahan ng mga Progresibong Kabataan v. Quezon City
,
[12]
 the minors' exercise of travel rights was restricted by the curfew ordinances. In several cases,
[13]

 the accused in a criminal case, especially those released on bail, were
 held to be validly prevented from departing from the Philippines. In 
Philippine Association of Service Exporters, Inc. v. Drilon
,
[14]

 the deployment ban was imposed on female domestic overseas workers. 
Further, during medical emergencies, a person may be isolated or 
quarantined to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.
[15]

 Even the statutes recognized as validly impairing the right to travel 
have, for its proper object, a palpably direct restraint on a person's 
freedom of movement, 
viz
.: (1) in the Human Security Act,
[16]
 the law restricts the right to travel of an 
individual charged
 with the crime of terrorism even though such person is out on bail; (2) in the Philippine Passport Act of 1996,
[17]

 the Secretary of Foreign Affairs or his authorized consular officer may
 refuse the issuance of, restrict the use of, or withdraw, a passport of
 a 
Filipino citizen
; (3) in the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003,
[18]

 the Bureau of Immigration, in order to manage migration and curb 
trafficking in persons, issued Memorandum Order RADJR No. 2011-011,
[19]
 allowing its Travel Control and Enforcement Unit to "offload 
passengers

 with fraudulent travel documents, doubtful purpose of travel, including
 possible victims of human trafficking" from the Philippine ports; and 
(4) in the Inter-Country Adoption Act of 1995,
[20]
 the Inter-Country Adoption Board may issue rules restrictive of an 
adoptee
's
 right to travel "to protect the Filipino child from abuse, 
exploitation, trafficking, and/or sale or any other practice in 
connection with adoption which is harmful, detrimental, or prejudicial 
to the child."
[21]
 In all these instances, the restrictions on the right to travel
 were imposed on a person or group of persons
,
[22]
 seemingly attaching unto them some form of "ball and chain" to limit their movement. 
Clearly, this is not the situation presented in this case. 
While
 the closure of Boracay pursuant to Proclamation No. 475 prohibited the 
entry of tourists and non-residents thereto, these people still remained
 free to move about in other parts of the country without arbitrary 
restraint. Thus, whatever effect such regulation may have on a person's 
ability to travel to such a specific place is merely incidental in 
nature and accordingly, is conceptually remote from the right's proper 
sense. To my mind, Proclamation No. 475 is more akin to government 
regulations that amount to the "cordoning-off" of areas ravaged by 
flood, fire, or other calamities, where access by people thereto may 
indeed be prohibited pursuant to considerations of safety and general 
welfare based on circumstantial exigencies. Thus, as the right to travel
 is not the correct vantage point to resolve this case, there is no need
 to determine whether or not an explicit statutory enactment exists to 
justify the impairment of said right as required under Section 6, 
Article III of the 1987 Constitution.

 Lest it be misunderstood, the extrication of this case from a "right to
 travel analysis" does not necessarily mean that the President is, by 
his sole accord, both 
authorized and justified
 in issuing Proclamation No. 475. 

 Fundamentally speaking, the President is the Chief of the Executive 
Department whose main task is to faithfully execute the laws. In its 
simple sense, his duty is not to make law, but rather, implement the 
law. Proclamation No. 475 is not law, but rather, an executive issuance 
which derives statutory imprimatur from existing laws and hence, has the
 "force and effect" of law. As its titular heading denotes, Proclamation
 No. 475 is a 
declaration of a state of calamity
 in the 
barangays

 of Balabag, Manoc-Manoc, and Yapak (Island of Boracay) in the 
Municipality of Malay, Aldan. In order to address the situation declared
 thereunder, it was necessary for the Executive to effect "expeditious 
rehabilitation," and to implement this objective, the President had to 
direct the area's temporary closure. 
 To be sure, insofar as this
 case is concerned, the power of the President to declare a state of 
calamity over a particular locality may be sourced from the 
Administrative Code of 1987
[24]
 in relation to the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010.
[25]

 Based on these laws, the President, pursuant to the recommendation of 
the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), is
 authorized to "declare a state of calamity
[26]
 in areas extensively damaged," as well as to approve "proposals to restore normalcy in the affected areas."
[27]

 On this basis, the NDRRMC recommended to the President not only the 
declaration of a state of calamity in Boracay but also, as a means to 
restore normalcy therein, the "temporary closure of the Island as a 
tourist destination" for the purpose of assisting the government in the 
"expeditious rehabilitation" of the same.
[28]

 Thus, as an off-shoot of the declaration of a state of calamity, and 
acting upon the recommendation of the NDRRMC, the President found it 
necessary to decree the temporary closure of the affected areas if only 
to ensure the Island's proper rehabilitation. 
 While it appears 
that the above-cited statutes do not spell out in "blackÂ­ and-white" the
 President's power to temporarily close-off an area, it is my opinion 
that a logical complement to the Executive's power to faithfully execute
 the laws is the authority to perform all necessary and incidental acts 
that are reasonably germane to the statutory objective that the 
President is, after all, tasked to execute. What comes to mind is the 
doctrine of necessary implication which evokes that "[e]very statute is 
understood, by implication, to contain all such provisions as may be 
necessary to effectuate its object and purpose, or to make effective 
rights, powers, privileges or jurisdiction which it grants, including 
all such collateral and subsidiary consequences as may be fairly and 
logically inferred from its terms. 
Ex necessitate legis.
 And every statutory grant of power, right or privilege is deemed to include all incidental power, right or privilege."
[29]

 This principle, in its general sense, holds true in this case. By and 
large, I find it unreasonable that a President who declares a state of 
calamity, and who has been further prompted by a specialized government 
agency created for disaster operations pursuant to existing laws to 
effect a viable plan of action is nonetheless impotent to pursue the 
necessary steps to effect a viable plan of action. Surely, the President
 must be given reasonable leeway to address calamitous situations, else 
he be reduced to a mere mouthpiece of doom. 
 At this juncture, it
 is apt to state that Proclamation No. 475 explicitly recognizes in its 
"whereas clauses" the State's constitutional duty to protect and advance
 the rights to health and to a balanced and healthful ecology,
[30]
 which duty has been translated in numerous legislative enactments, such as the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004,
[31]

 and as mentioned, the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management
 Act of 2010, as well as the Administrative Code of 1987. The Philippine
 Clean Water Act of 2004 authorizes the Department of Environment and 
Natural Resources (DENR) to undertake emergency clean-up operations
[32]

 to counter water pollution. As earlier mentioned, the Philippine 
Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 empowers the NDRRMC 
to recommend the declaration of a state of calamity in areas extensively
 damaged by either natural or human-induced hazards such as environment 
degradation, as well as proposals to restore normalcy in the affected 
areas, such as through 
rehabilitation
[33]

 or the rebuilding of damaged infrastructures. Further, the 
Administrative Code of 1987 grants the DENR the power to "exercise 
supervision and control over [alienable public lands],"
[34]

 such as Boracay, and the Department of Interior and Local Government 
the authority to implement programs "to meet national or local 
emergencies arising from natural or man-made disasters,"
[35]
 such as environmental destruction.

 Ultimately, the agglomeration of the above-stated laws reveals that the
 Executive Department has sufficient statutory authority to clean up the
 Island. Since the Constitution vests all executive power in the 
President, and on this score, grants him the power of control over all 
executive departments, he can, within the bounds of law, integrate and 
take on the above-stated functions, and in the exercise of which, issue a
 directive to implement an environmental rehabilitation program as 
recommended by the relevant state agency. At the risk of sounding 
repetitive, the temporary closure of the Island to tourists was 
necessary to effectively execute Boracay's rehabilitation program 
pursuant to a declaration of a state of calamity. Therefore, the 
President had sufficient authority from both the Constitution and 
statutes to issue Proclamation No. 475. That being said, and as a point 
of clarification, I find it unnecessary to situate such authority in his
 unstated residual powers.
[36]
 

 Having discussed the President's authority, the final question to be 
traversed is whether or not there was ample justification for the 
issuance of Proclamation No. 475. 
 As previously mentioned, this 
case should not be assessed against the parameters of the right to 
travel. As Proclamation No. 475 constitutes a restriction not against a 
person's freedom of movement, but rather, a "placeÂ­ based" regulation, I
 deem it appropriate to instead examine the issuance's validity under 
the lens of petitioners' right to property under Section 1, Article III 
of the 1987 Constitution. After all, this approach specifically 
corresponds to petitioners' line of argumentation. In particular, as 
found in the petition, petitioners Mark Anthony V. Zabal (Zabal) and 
Thiting Estoso Jacosalem (Jacosalem) assail the validity of Proclamation
 No. 475 on the ground that it violated their right as persons earning a
 living in the Boracay Island. As alleged, Zabal earns a living by 
making sandcastles while Jacosalem works as a driver for tourists.
[37]
 Accordingly, they submit that the exclusion of tourists from the Island drastically affected their trade or livelihood.
[38]
 

 Under the auspices of Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution, 
protected property includes the right to work and the right to earn a 
living.
[39]
 The purpose of the
 due process guaranty is "to prevent arbitrary governmental encroachment
 against the life, liberty, and property of individuals."
[40]

 While the right to property is sheltered by due process provision, it 
is by no means absolute as it must yield to the general welfare.
[41]

 Thus, the State may deprive persons of property rights provided that 
the means employed are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of 
the purpose and not unduly oppressive upon individuals.
[42]
 

 In this case, although the exclusion of tourists from the Island 
drastically affected the trade or livelihood of those reliant on them, 
including petitioners, I submit that the government had a 
legitimate State interest

 in rehabilitating the affected localities of Boracay given the Island's
 current critical state. Findings of various government agencies in the 
Island reveal its precarious environmental condition, to wit: (
a
) high concentration of fecal coliform due to improper sewage infrastructure and sewer waste management system; (
b
) dirty water resulting in the degradation of coral reefs and coral cover; (
c
) improper solid waste management; (
d
) destruction of natural habitats in the island; (
e
) beach erosion caused by illegal extraction of sand along the beach; (
f
) illegal structures along the foreshore; and (
g
) unauthorized discharge of untreated waste water near the shore.
[43]
 Notably, these environmental problems were found to have been aggravated by "tourist influx."
[44]
 

 To effectively remedy the Island's environmental woes, "expeditious 
rehabilitation" thereof became crucial, and in line therewith, the entry
 of tourists became necessary to suspend. As aptly rationalized in the 
ponencia
: 
  


 Certainly, the closure of Boracay, albeit temporarily, gave the 
island its much needed breather, and likewise afforded the government 
the necessary leeway in its rehabilitation program. Note that apart from
 review, evaluation and amendment of relevant policies, 
the bulk of 
the rehabilitation activities involved inspection, testing, demolition, 
relocation, and construction. These works could not have easily been 
done with tourists present. The rehabilitation works in the first place 
were not simple, superficial or mere cosmetic but rather quite 
complicated, major, and permanent in character as they were intended to 
serve as long term solutions to the problem. 
x x x Moreover, as part
 of the rehabilitation efforts, operations of establishments in Boracay 
had to be halted in the course thereof since majority, if not all of 
them, need to comply with environmental and regulatory requirements in 
order to align themselves with the government's goal to restore Boracay 
into normalcy and develop its sustainability. 
Allowing tourists into 
the island while it was undergoing necessary rehabilitation would 
therefore be pointless as no establishment would cater to their 
accommodation and other needs. 
Besides, it could not be said that 
Boracay, at the time of the issuance of the questioned proclamation, was
 in such a physical state that would meet its purpose of being a tourist
 destination. For one, its beach waters could not be said to be totally 
safe for swimming. x x x Indeed, the temporary closure of Boracay, 
although unprecedented and radical as it may seem, was reasonably 
necessary and not unduly oppressive under the circumstances. 
It was 
the most practical and realistic means of ensuring that rehabilitation 
works in the island are started and carried out in the most efficacious 
and expeditious way.
[45]
 (Emphases supplied) 




Moreover, the limited six (6)-month period shows that the closure 
was not unduly oppressive upon individuals, and was put in place only to
 implement the desired State objective. Therefore, all things 
considered, Proclamation No. 475 cannot be said to have been issued with
 grave abuse of discretion, and as such, remains constitutional.


 Accordingly, I vote to 
DISMISS
 the petition.

LEONEN, 
J
.:


With respect to my esteemed colleagues, I dissent.

 Proclamation No. 475, s. 2018 (or the Proclamation) is unconstitutional, as it is an impermissible exercise of police power.

 It violates the right to life and liberty properly invoked by 
petitioners without due process of law. The Proclamation imposes a 
closure and a deprivation of the livelihood of those who have not been 
shown to have caused the high levels of fecal coliform and other human 
made incursions into Boracay's ecology which invited President Rodrigo 
Duterte's drastic actions. The specific actions and programs to be 
undertaken during the closure of the entire island, so as to properly 
advise the residents, workers, and others interested, are not clearly 
stated. The six (6)-month duration of the closure is arbitrary. The 
state of calamity will persist even after the closure expires. The 
lifting of the declaration of the state of calamity is not preceded by 
any discernible standard. The Department of the Interior and Local 
Government "Guidelines" (DILG Guidelines) for the closure were issued 
prior to the promulgation of the Proclamation. It is inconsistent with 
the latter, containing provisions with serious constitutional 
implications.
 The Proclamation is unduly vague. It is unconstitutionally broad. 
Proclamation No. 475 is contrary to the very statutes it allegedly implements, Republic Acts No. 10121
[1]
 and 9275.
[2]

 The ecological problem in Boracay is not the calamity envisioned in 
Republic Act No. 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and 
Management Act of 2010. By exercising control rather than merely 
supervision, the Presidential exercise violates the constitutionally 
protected principle of local autonomy. Contrary to the Majority's view, 
such infringement is neither incidental nor marginal. 
 Assuming 
that a state of calamity was properly declared, the Proclamation upends 
the framework of locally-led remediation and rehabilitation efforts 
mandated by the statutes. By declaring that only the President can lift 
the declaration, the Proclamation violates Republic Act No. 10121. 

 Human induced ecological disasters need to be addressed deliberately, 
systematically, structurally and with all institutions of government 
actively engaging public participation. There are laws already in place 
that could have been properly enforced. The right intentions however 
must always be accompanied by the right and legal means. The Majority's 
tolerance for the dramatic and drastic actions of the Chief Executive 
violates the rule of law and undermines constitutional democracy. 

 Considering the many calamities our society has to face, upholding the 
framework contained in Proclamation No. 475 invites a regime that is 
borderline authoritarian. 
 
I


 The Petition raises questions relating to petitioners' right to 
travel and right to due process. I join Associate Justice Alfredo 
Benjamin Caguioa's view that the right to travel has been violated 
especially in light of the most recent unanimous decision of this Court 
in 
Genuino v De Lima
.
[3]
 Fundamentally, however, I vote to grant the Petition on due process grounds. 
 The basic rights asserted by petitioners are acknowledged in Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution: 



 SECTION 1. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law[.]




 The due process clause is written as a proscription.
[4]

 	It implies a sphere of individual autonomy that is constitutionally 
protected. As early as 1890, in the seminal work of Louis D. Brandeis 
and Samuel Warren, this sphere was referred to as the "right to be left 
alone" from interference by the State. Reviewing its evolution in common
 law:



 That the individual shall have full protection in person and in 
property is a principle as old as the common law; but it has been found 
necessary from time to time to define anew the exact nature and extent 
of such protection. Political, social and economic changes entail the 
recognition of new rights, and the common law, in its eternal youth, 
grows to meet the demands of society. Thus, in very early times, the law
 gave a remedy only for physical interference with life and property, 
for trespasses 
vi et armis
. Then the "right to life" served only 
to protect the subject from battery in its various forms; liberty meant 
freedom from actual restraint; and the right to property secured to the 
individual his lands and his cattle. Later, there came a recognition of 
man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect. Gradually the
 scope of these legal rights broadened; and now the right to life has 
come to mean the right to enjoy life,âthe right to be let alone; the 
right to liberty secures the exercise of extensive civil privileges; and
 the term "property" has grown to comprise every form of 
possessionâintangible, as well as tangible.


 Thus, with the recognition of the legal value of sensations, the 
protection against actual bodily injury was extended to prohibit mere 
attempts to do such injury; that is, the putting another in fear of such
 injury. From the action of battery grew that of assault. Much later 
there came a qualified protection of the individual against offensive 
noises and odors, against dust and smoke and excessive vibration. The 
law of nuisance was developed. So regard for human emotions soon 
extended the scope of personal immunity beyond the body of the 
individual. His reputation, the standing among his fellow-men, was 
considered, and the law of slander and libel arose. Man's family 
relations became a part of the legal conception of his life, and the 
alienation of a wife's affections was held remediable. Occasionally the 
law halted,âas in its refusal to recognize the intrusion by seduction 
upon the honor of the family. But even here the demands of society were 
met. A mean fiction, the action per 
quod servitium amisit
, was 
resorted to, and by allowing damages for injury to the parents' 
feelings, an adequate remedy was oridinarily afforded. Similar to the 
expansion of the right to life was the growth of the legal conception of
 property. From corporeal property arose the incorporeal rights issuing 
out of it; and then there opened the wide realm of intangible property, 
in the products and processes of the mind, as works of literature and 
art, goodwill, trade secrets, and trademarks.


 This development of the law was inevitable.

 (Citations omitted) 




 The structure of the due process clause and the primordial value it 
conceals do not limit protection of life only to one's corporeal 
existence.
[6]
 Liberty is more than just physical restraint.	Even	property can be incorporeal.
[7]


 In 
Secretary of National Defense et al. v. Manalo et al
.:
[8]




 While the right to life under Article III, Section 1 guarantees 
essentially the right to be aliveâupon which the enjoyment of all other 
rights is preconditionedâthe right to security of person is a guarantee 
of the secure quality of this life, 
viz
.: "The life to which each
 person has a right is not a life lived in fear that his person and 
property may be unreasonably violated by a powerful ruler. Rather, it is
 a life lived with the assurance that the government he established and 
consented to, will protect the security of his person and property. The 
ideal of security in life and property . . .  pervades the whole history
 of man. It touches every aspect of man's existence." In a broad sense, 
the right to security of person "emanates in a person's legal and 
uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, his health, 
and his reputation. It includes the right to exist, and the enjoyment of
 life while existing, and it is invaded not only by a deprivation of 
life but also of those things which are necessary to the enjoyment of 
life according to the nature, temperament and lawful desires of the 
individual.
[9]
 (Citations omitted)




 
City of Manila v. Laguio, Jr
.
[10]
 reiterated the broad conception of the right to life and liberty:



 [T]he right to exist and the right to be free from arbitrary 
restraint or servitude. The term cannot be dwarfed into mere freedom 
from physical restraint of the person of the citizen, but is deemed to 
embrace the 
right of man to enjoy the faculties with which he has been endowed by his Creator
, subject only to such restraint as are necessary for the common welfare.
[11]
  (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)




 The rights to life and liberty are inextricably woven. Life is 
nothing without liberties. Without a full life, the fullest of liberties
 protected by our constitutional order will not happen. Again, in 
 City of Manila
: 



 While the Court has not attempted to define with exactness the 
liberty . . . guaranteed [by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments], the 
term denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also 
the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life
,
 to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up 
children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own 
conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized . . .
 
as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men
. In a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of "liberty" must be broad indeed.
[12]
 (Emphasis supplied)




 Thereafter: 



 These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a 
person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and 
autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth 
Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right 
to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of universe, and of the mystery of human life.
 Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood where they formed under compulsion of the State. 
[13]
 




 Likewise, in my Concurring Opinion in 
Spark v Quezon City
:
[14]




 Speaking of life and its protection does not merely entail 
ensuring biological subsistence. It is not just a proscription against 
killing. Likewise, speaking of liberty and its protection does not 
merely involve a lack of physical restraint. The objects of the 
constitutional protection of due process are better understood 
dynamically and from a frame of consummate human dignity. They are 
likewise better understood integrally, operating in a synergistic frame 
that serves to secure a person's integrity. 


 "Life, liberty and property" is akin to the United Nations' 
formulation of "life, liberty, and security of person" and the American 
formulation of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."  As the  
Declaration of Independence postulates, they are "unalienable rights" 
for which "[g]overnments are instituted among men" in order that they 
may be secured. 	Securing them denotes pursuing and obtaining them, as 
much as it denotes preserving them. The formulation is, thus, an 
aspirational declaration, not merely operating on factual givens but 
enabling the pursuit of ideals. 


 "Life," then, is more appropriately understood as the fullness of 
human potential: not merely organic, physiological existence, but 
consummate self-actualization, enabled and effected not only by freedom 
from bodily restraint but by facilitating an empowering existence. "Life
 and liberty," placed in the context of a constitutional aspiration, it 
then becomes the duty of the government to facilitate this empowering 
existence. This is not an inventively novel understanding but one that 
has been at the bedrock of our social and political conceptions. As 
Justice George Malcolm, speaking for this Court in 1919, articulated: 




 Civil liberty may be said to mean that measure of freedom which 
may be enjoyed in a civilized community, consistently with the peaceful 
enjoyment of like freedom in others. The right to liberty guaranteed by 
the Constitution includes the right to exist and the right to be free 
from arbitrary personal restraint or servitude. The term cannot be 
dwarfed into mere freedom from physical restraint of the person of the 
citizen, but is deemed to embrace the right of man to enjoy the 
faculties with which he has been endowed by his Creator, subject only to
 such restraints as are necessary for the common welfare. As enunciated 
in a long array of authorities including epoch-making decisions of the 
United States Supreme Court, liberty includes the right of the citizen 
to be free to use his faculties in lawful ways; to live and work where 
he will; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any 
avocation, and for that purpose, to enter into all contracts which may 
be proper, necessary, and essential to his carrying out these purposes 
to a successful conclusion. The chief elements of the guaranty are the 
right to contract, the right to choose one's employment, the right to 
labor, and the right of locomotion. 




 It is in this sense that the constitutional listing of the objects
 of due process protection admits amorphous bounds. The constitutional 
protection of life and liberty encompasses a penumbra of cognate rights 
that is not fixed but evolves â expanding liberty â alongside the 
contemporaneous reality in which the Constitution operates. 
People v. Hernandez
 illustrated how the right to liberty is multi-faceted and is not limited to its initial formulation in the due process clause: 




 [T]he preservation of liberty is such a major preoccupation of 
our political system that, not satisfied with guaranteeing its enjoyment
 in the very first paragraph of section (1) of the Bill of Rights, the 
framers of our Constitution devoted paragraphs (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), 
(8), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), and (21) of said 
section (1) to the protection of several aspects of freedom.
[15]
 (Citations omitted) 






 Petitioners assert that due process covers the right to livelihood, to work and earn a living.
[16]

 The pleadings were brought by a sandcastle builder, a driver, and a 
non-resident. The first two (2) are informal workers who have no 
economic resources other than their ability to provide their services. 
The last petitioner is a citizen claiming his right, as a Filipino, to 
enjoy the natural beauty of his countryâhis right to travel. 
 The
 majority unfortunately canisters this right as falling under the right 
to property. The argument is that since petitioners have no vested 
rights on their sources of income, they are not entitled to due process.
 Even if tourists were still allowed in the island, they earn nothing if
 no one avails of their services. Thus, since petitioners' earnings are 
contingent and merely inchoate, the right to property does not yet 
exist. 
 I disagree. 
 The right invoked is not merely the 
right to property. The right to livelihood falls within the spectrum of 
the almost inviolable right to life and liberty. The ability to answer a
 calling, evolve, and create a better version of oneself, in the process
 of serving others, is a quintessential part of one's life. The right to
 life is not a mere corporeal existence, but includes one's choice of 
occupation. This is as important as to those who belong to the informal 
sector. It is an aspect of social justice that their right to be able to
 earn a livelihood should be protected by our Constitution. 
 In 
the hierarchy of rights, the right to life and the right to liberty sit 
higher than the right to property. This is also the import of Article 
II, Section 11 of the Constitution which provides: 



 SECTION 11. The State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights. 




 We recognize the primacy of human rights over property rights 
because these rights are "delicate and vulnerable[.]" They are so 
precious in our society, such that the threat of sanctions may deter 
their exercise almost as strongly as the actual application of 
sanctions. They "need breathing space to survive"; thus, government 
regulation is allowable only with "narrow specificity."
[17]
 

 In contrast, property rights may be readily qualified as evidenced by 
the many rules and laws that have been enacted on property ownership and
 possession. Article XII, Section 6 of the Constitution qualifies the 
right to property:



 SECTION 6. The use of property bears as social function, and all 
economic agents shall contribute to the common good. Individuals and 
private groups, including corporations, cooperatives, and similar 
collective organizations, shall have the right to own, establish, and 
operate economic enterprises, subject to the duty of the State to 
promote distributive justice and to intervene when the common good so 
demands. 




 As early as in 
Ermita-Malate Hotel and Motel Operators Association v. City of Manila
,
[18]

 this Court already emphasized that if the liberty involved were 
"freedom of the mind or the person, the standard for the validity of 
governmental acts is much more rigorous and exacting, but where the 
liberty curtailed affects at the most rights of property, the 
permissible scope of regulatory measures is wider."
[19]


 We are not confronted with a situation where the government 
simply regulates one's occupation. Here, the shutdown contemplated in 
Proclamation No. 475 is complete. The total deprivation of their right 
to exercise their occupation was curtailed. 
 For those who have a
 very regular and lucrative source of income, a period of six (6) months
 may not be a long time. However, to those within the informal sector, 
losing their jobs even for a day can spell disaster not only for 
themselves, but also for their families. Not only do they have legal 
standing to challenge the Proclamation, but they also do so invoking one
 (1) of the most primordial of our fundamental rights. 
 The 
Proclamation deprives them of their livelihood not for a day, for a 
week, or for even a month, but for six (6) months. The Proclamation 
itselfâ or any law that is purportedly meant to have authorized the 
issuance of such proclamationâdoes not provide a credible means of 
compensation for them. It does not mention any remedial measures for 
those whose rights will be affected. It is not only police power that 
exists. Fundamental rights vested by the Constitution could only be 
considered collateral damage undeserving of any form of redress.
 Parenthetically, even if the characterization of their plea belongs to the right to property, 
Southern Luzon Drug Corporation v. Department of Social Welfare and Development,
[20]
 is not on point.

  In 
Southern Luzon Drug Corporation
, we dealt with the 
question as to whether the shift in tax treatment of the 20% discount 
given to senior citizens and persons with disability was a valid 
exercise of police power. The case did not involve the livelihood of 
individuals; rather, it involved the profits of an ongoing business. 
Furthermore, the businesses affected by the senior citizen's discount 
were not suspended. The case only concerned itself on the proper way of 
computing their taxes for incomes they have not yet received. 
 
There is a fundamental difference in treatment between a business and 
human labor under our Constitution. Human labor is given more 
protection. This is found in Article XIII, Section 3 of the 
Constitution: 



 SECTION 3. The State shall afford full protection to labor, local 
and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and
 equality of employment opportunities for all. 




 Here, what happened was not a mere regulation of a business. It was a
 closure of an entire island that ceased to make any of the means to a 
livelihood known to them possible. 
 It is unfortunate that the 
Majority made judicial findings accepting the government's argument that
 petitioners were free to move and practice their profession elsewhere.
[21]
 This was without basis. 

 Not all informal workers are mobile simply because not all of them have
 financial resources to move from one (1) place to another. Not all of 
them have multiple skills that would allow them the flexibility to be 
employed in another line of work immediately when their current 
consistent source of income stops. Precisely, they become part of the 
informal sector because through their circumstances, they have been 
unable to evolve to more marketable skills. To nonchalantly assume that 
they can find other jobs should not be an acceptable judicial approach, 
as that may trivialize the rights they assert. It is an 
unfortunateâthough perhaps unintendedâdisplay of our lack of compassion 
for the plight of petitioners. 
 Certainly, this is not the 
judicial approach sanctioned by our Constitution. Article II, Sections 9
 and 10 of the Constitution call attention to sensitivity to social 
justice, thus: 



 SECTION 9. The State shall promote a just and dynamic social order
 that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free
 the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social	 
 services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an 
improved quality of life for all.


 SECTION 10. The State shall promote social justice in all phases of national development. 




 Together, these constitutional provisions provide that social 
justice cannot be achieved through an overgeneralized understanding of 
labor. The informal sector, represented by petitioners, does not have 
the same mobility of other workers who have more skills. They do not 
also have the same mobility as the businesses that filed the petition in
 
Southern Luzon Drug Corporation.
[22]


 Undoubtedly, here, the total negation of petitioners' 
opportunity to do their livelihood was a deprivation of their right to 
life and liberty. Definitely, they had standing to sue. 
 
II


 The breadth of the constitutional protection of life and liberty
 may continue to evolve with contemporary realities. However, the 
textual basis in the Constitution is fixed: any intrusion must be with 
due process of law. 
 Jurisprudence evolved three (3) levels of due process analysis. 
 In 
Ermita Malate Hotel and Motel Operators Association
,
[23]

 where the validity of an ordinance was upheld, this Court reasoned that
 the ordinance was a police power measure aimed at safeguarding public 
morals, and thus, is immune from imputation of nullity: 



 To hold otherwise would be to 
unduly restrict and narrow the 
scope of police power which has been properly characterized as the most 
essential, insistent and the least limitable of powers
, extending 
as it does "to all the great public needs." It would be, to paraphrase 
another leading decision, to destroy the very purpose of the state if it
 could be deprived or allowed itself to be deprived of its competence to
 promote public health, public morals, public safety and the general 
welfare. Negatively put, police power is "that inherent and plenary 
power in the State which enables it to prohibit all that is hurtful to 
the comfort, safety, and welfare of society."
[24]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 In that case, the Court viewed due process as merely requiring that 
the challenged action "must not outrun the bounds of reasons and result 
in sheer oppression. Due process is thus hostile to any official action 
marred by lack of reasonableness. Correctly has it been identified as 
freedom from arbitrariness. It is the embodiment of the sporting idea of
 fair play."
[25]
 
 Decades later, in 
City of Manila
,
[26]

 an ordinance that prohibited persons and corporations from contracting 
and engaging in any business providing certain forms of amusement, 
entertainment, services, and facilities, where women were used as tools 
in entertainment, was struck down as unconstitutional because it 
affected the moral welfare of the community. This Court clearly defined 
the test of a valid ordinance: 



 [I]t must not only be within the corporate powers of the local 
government unit to enact and must be passed according to the procedure 
prescribed by law, it must also conform to the following substantive 
requirements: (1) must not contravene the Constitution or any statute; 
(2) must not be unfair or oppressive; (3) must not be partial or 
discriminatory; (4) must not prohibit but may regulate trade; (5) must 
be general and consistent with public policy; and (6) must not be 
unreasonable.
[27]
 




 Only a few years later, in 
White Light Corporation v. City of Manila
,
[28]
 this Court elaborated: 



 The general test of the validity of an ordinance on substantive 
due process grounds is best tested when assessed with the evolved 
footnote 4 test laid down by the U.S. Supreme Court in
 U.S. v. Carolene Products
. Footnote 4 of the 
Carolene Products

 case acknowledged that the judiciary would defer to the legislature 
unless there is a discrimination against a "discrete and insular" 
minority or infringement of a "fundamental right". Consequently, two 
standards of judicial review were established: strict scrutiny for laws 
dealing with freedom of the mind or restricting the political process, 
and the rational basis standard of review for economic legislation. 


 A third standard, denominated as heightened or immediate scrutiny,
 was later adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court for evaluating 
classifications based on gender and legitimacy. Immediate scrutiny was 
adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in 
Craig
, after the Court declined to do so in 
Reed v. Reed
.
 While the test may have first been articulated in equal protection 
analysis, it has in the United States since been applied in all 
substantive due process cases as well. 


 We ourselves have often applied the rational basis test mainly in 
analysis of equal protection challenges. Using the rational basis 
examination, laws or ordinances are upheld if they rationally further a 
legitimate governmental interest. Under intermediate review, 
governmental interest is extensively examined and the availability of 
less restrictive measures is considered. Applying strict scrutiny, the 
focus is on the presence of compelling, rather than substantial, 
governmental interest and on the absence of less restrictive means for 
achieving that interest. 


 In terms of judicial review of statutes or ordinances, strict 
scrutiny refers to the standard for determining the quality and the 
amount of governmental interest brought to justify the regulation of 
fundamental freedoms. Strict scrutiny is used today to test the validity
 of laws dealing with the regulation of speech, gender, or race as well 
as other fundamental rights as expansion from its earlier applications 
to equal protection. The United States Supreme Court has expanded the 
scope of strict scrutiny to protect fundamental rights such as suffrage,
 judicial access and interstate travel.
[29]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Recently, in 
Fernando, et al. v. St. Scholastica's College, et al
.,
[30]
 we again discussed the three (3) levels of tests employed when there is a breach of a fundamental right. 

 In 
Spark v. Quezon City
,
[31]
 I reviewed in a Concurring Opinion the extent of the three (3) modes of due process review: 



 An appraisal of due process and equal protection challenges 
against government regulation must admit that the gravity of interests 
invoked by the government and the personal liberties or classification 
affected are not uniform. Hence, the three (3) levels of analysis that 
demand careful calibration: the rational basis test, intermediate 
review, and strict scrutiny. Each level is typified by the dual 
considerations of: first, the interest invoked by the government; and 
second, the means employed to achieve that interest. 


 The rational basis test requires only that there be a legitimate 
government interest and that there is a reasonable connection between it
 and the means employed to achieve it. 


 Intermediate review requires an important government interest. 
Here, it would suffice if government is able to demonstrate substantial 
connection between its interest and the means it employs. In accordance 
with 
White Light
, "the availability of less restrictive measures [must have been] 
considered
."
 This demands a conscientious effort at devising the least restrictive 
means for attaining its avowed interest. It is enough that the means 
employed is
 conceptually
 the least restrictive mechanism that the government may apply. 


 Strict scrutiny applies when what is at stake are fundamental 
freedoms or what is involved are suspect classifications. It requires 
that there be a compelling state interest and that the means employed to
 effect it are narrowly-tailored,
 actually 
â not only 
conceptually â being the least restrictive means for effecting the 
invoked interest. Here, it does not suffice that the government 
contemplated on the means available to it. Rather, it must show an 
active effort at demonstrating the inefficacy of all  possible 
alternatives. Here, it is required to not only explore all possible 
avenues but to even debunk the viability of alternatives so as to ensure
 that its chosen course of action is the sole effective means. To the 
extent practicable, this must be supported by sound data gathering 
mechanisms. 


 
Central Bank Employees Association, Inc. v. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas 
further explained: 




 Under most circumstances, the Court will exercise judicial 
restraint in deciding questions of constitutionality, recognizing the 
broad discretion given to Congress in exercising its legislative power. 
Judicial scrutiny would be based on the "rational basis" test, and the 
legislative discretion would be given deferential treatment. 


 
But if the challenge to the statute is premised on the 
denial of a fundamental right, or the perpetuation of prejudice against 
persons favored by the Constitution with special protection, judicial 
scrutiny ought to be more strict.
 A weak and watered down view 
would call for the abdication of this Court's solemn duty to strike down
 any law repugnant to the Constitution and the rights it enshrines. This
 is true whether the actor committing the unconstitutional act is a 
private person or the government itself or one of its instrumentalities.
 Oppressive acts will be struck down regardless of the character or 
nature of the actor. 




 Cases involving strict scrutiny innately favor the preservation of
 fundamental rights and the non-discrimination of protected classes. 
Thus, in these cases, the burden falls upon the government to prove that
 it was impelled by a compelling state interest and that there is 
actually no other less restrictive mechanism for realizing the interest 
that it invokes: 


 Applying strict scrutiny, the focus is on the presence of 
compelling, rather than substantial, governmental interest and on the 
absence of less restrictive means for achieving that interest, and the 
burden befalls upon the State to prove the same.
[32]
 (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) 




 The Constitution mandates more sensitivity towards several classes 
and identities found within our society. Social justice at all levels of
 governances is an overarching state policy. This envisions a dynamic 
social order that will ensure prosperity and "free the people from 
poverty"
[33]
 through policies 
which "provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a 
rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all."
[34]
 Our fundamental law "values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights."
[35]
 Women, the youth, indigenous peoples, 	farmers and 	farmworkers, labor in general 	enjoy	significant protection. 

 These provisions are not merely sardonic normative ornaments. Those who
 find themselves at the margins of societyâthrough the operation of an 
oppressive political economy, or the stereotypes of contemporary 
culture, or as residues of our colonial pastâdeserve more judicial 
sensitivity. With respect to the due process clause, it means that when 
the everyday livelihood of those found within our informal sector are 
affected, an invocation of their fundamental right at least deserves a 
stricter judicial scrutiny. Unfortunately, the Majority Opinion failed 
to do so. 
 
III


 Even with the lowest level of scrutinyâthe reasonability of the 
means to achieve a legitimate purpose testâthe Proclamation should have 
failed judicial review for three (3) basic reasons. First, the coercive 
remedial measures contained in the Proclamation was so broad as to 
affect those who are innocent bystanders or those who are compliant with
 the law. Second, the Proclamation is vague and contradicts at least the
 DILG Guidelines and existing statutes; namely, our Civil Code and 
Republic Act No. 9275. Third, the Proclamation is not justified and is 
contradictory to Republic Act No. 10121.
 This Court has, on many 
occasions struck down executive actions when it tends to unreasonably 
affect the rights of innocent third parties, who should not have been 
otherwise subjected to coercive measures. 
 
White Light Corporation
,
[36]

 dealt with an ordinance that prohibited wash-up rates within the 
territory of the local government unit. It appeared that its intentions 
were to deprive the use of hotels and motels from commercial sex workers
 and those engaged in illicit affairs. 
 This Court, however, 
without going into the legitimacy of the objective of the measure, still
 nullified the ordinance. Other individuals, such as spouses or 
travelers or others who simply need a place to nap or shower, would also
 likely benefit from the short periods of accommodation that would 
charge the wash-up rates. This Court declared that "individual rights 
may be adversely affected only to the extent that may be required by the
 legitimate demands of public interest or public welfare."
[37]
 

 Proclamation No. 475 acknowledges that innocent parties and those who 
are compliant with existing laws will be affected. In its preambular 
clauses the government acknowledges: 



 WHEREAS, the investigations and validation undertaken revealed that:




 . . . .






b.


Most commercial 
establishments and residences are not connected to the sewerage 
infrastructure of Boracay Island, and waste products are not being 
disposed through the proper sewerage infrastructures in violation of 
environmental law, rules, and regulations;






 


 






c.


Only 14 out of 51 establishments near 
the shores of Boracay Island are compliant with the provisions of 
Republic Act (RA) No. 9275 or the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004;






 






. . . . 






 


 






e.


Solid waste within Boracay Island is at
 a generation rate of 90 to 115 tons per day, while the hauling capacity
 of the local government is only 30 tons per day, hence leaving 
approximately 85 tons of waste in the Island daily;






 






. . . . 






 


 






g.


Only four (4) out of nine (9) wetlands 
in Boracay Island remain due to illegal encroachment of structures, 
including 937 identified illegal structures constructed on forestlands 
and wetlands, as well as 102 illegal structures on areas already 
classified as easements, and the disappearance of the wetlands, which 
act as natural catchments, enhances flooding in the area[.]
[38]










There are commercial establishments and residential areas connected 
to the sewage infrastructure. There are at least 14 establishments who 
comply with Republic Act No. 9275 or the Philippine Clean Water Act of 
2004. There are wetlands that are not affected by illegal structures. 
There are residents and commercial establishments whose garbage are 
collected properly. More importantly, petitioners are not shown to have 
contributed to the formation of fecal coliform in the targeted beaches 
of Boracay.


 Similar to the situation in 
White Light Corporation
,
[39]

 the coercive remedial measures are too broad that it affects those who 
may not be responsible for the evil sought to be addressed.
 
IV


 Secondly, the Proclamation does not pass due process scrutiny 
because it is vague that it does not adequately provide notice to all 
those affected as to what the Chief Executive, through his various 
departments, intend to do and how the rights of those encompassed within
 its broad sweep will be affected. Worse, the deployment of a massive 
contingent of law enforcers and the curtailment of freedom of the press 
may have served to stifle questions as to the specific contours of the 
actions of government to address the ecological situation in the island.
 
 We review the chronological context of the government's actions
 as contained in the pleadings. Apparently, the closure was effected 
even before the Proclamation was promulgated through DILG Guidelines. 

 Sometime in February last year, President Duterte, in one of his 
speeches, described Boracay as a "cesspool" and ordered the Department 
of Environment and Natural Resources to clean up the island.
[40]

 On March 6, 2018, he announced that he would be placing Boracay under a
 state of calamity. He warned the courts not to interfere or issue 
Temporary Restraining Orders and threatened to charge the local 
officials of Boracay with sedition if they were to resist.
[41]
 

 On April 4, 2018, during a cabinet meeting, he approved the total 
closure of the island for six (6) months, beginning April 26, 2018. The 
day after, Spokesperson Harry L. Roque confirmed the rumors that Boracay
 was indeed being closed on the basis of police power.
[42]
 

 On their websites, publications Rappler and ABS-CBN reported that the 
Department of Interior and Local Government issued guidelines for the 
closure,
[43]
 and that 630 police and military personnel have been deployed on the island.
[44]
 
 The DILG Guidelines provide: 

No going beyond Jetty Port.
 Identified tourists will not be allowed into the island and will be stopped at the Jetty Port in Malay, Aklan. 
 
No ID, no entry.
 Residents/workers/resort owners
 will be allowed entry into the island subject to the presentation of 
identification cards specifying a residence in Boracay. All 
government-issued IDs will be recognized. Non-government IDs are 
acceptable as long as they are accompanied by a barangay certification 
of residency.
 
Swimming for locals only. 
Generally, swimming 
shall not be allowed anywhere on the island. However, residents may be 
allowed to swim only at Angol Beach in station 3 from 6 am to 5pm.
 
One condition for entry. 
No visitors of Boracay 
residents shall be allowed entry, except under emergency situations, and
 with the clearance of the security committee composed of DILG 
representative, police, and local government officials. 
 
Journalists need permission to cover. 
Media will
 be allowed entry subject to prior approval from the Department of 
Tourism, with a definite duration and limited movement.
No floating structures.
 No floating structures shall be allowed up to 15 kilometers from the shoreline. 
 
Foreign residents to be checked.
 The Bureau of Immigration will revalidate the papers of foreigners who have found a home in Boracay. 
 
One entry, one exit point.
 There will only be one transportation point to Boracay Island. Authorities have yet to decide where.
[45]
 (Emphasis in the original)


 On April 24, 2018, petitioners came to this Court. They are a 
sandcastle builder, a driver and a non-resident who visits the island. 
 Two (2) days later, President Duterte issued Proclamation No. 475 and the shutdown of the entire island commenced. 
 After being able to access the Proclamation, Petitioners filed a Supplemental Petition on May 10, 2018. 

 The DILG Guidelines are rudimentary and merely provide who may enter 
the island and how they are to do so. On the other hand, the 
Proclamation provides for the implementation of "urgent measures," the 
designation by Department of Environment and Natural Resources of water 
bodies where specific pollutants have exceeded the water quality levels,
 and powers to take "measures" to improve the water quality. 
 The
 DILG Guidelines, as reported, mention "identified tourists", limit 
swimming only to "residents" to areas which are free from malevolent 
bacteria. It does not allow swimming for workers of establishments or 
the members of law enforcement contingent sent to the island. It also 
curtails visitation of residents. The DILG Guidelines also require media
 to register without any guidance as to the basis for allowing or 
rejecting coverage, seriously raising issues regarding whether freedom 
of expression and/or the press has been abridged. 
 While none of 
the provisions in the DILG Guidelines are contained specifically in 
Proclamation No. 475, the latter does not specifically repeal the 
former. 
 The programs and activities that the Proclamation puts 
into effect are unclear. There are no provisions to alleviate those 
whose rights will be affected and the remedies that will be available to
 those aggrieved. More than any reasonable piece of legislation, it only
 seems to grant amorphous powers to the President. 
 The Proclamation provides: 



 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE
, President
 of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the 
Constitution and existing laws, do hereby declare a State of Calamity in
 the barangays of Balabag, Manoc-Manoc and Yapak (Island of Boracay) in 
the Municipality of Malay, Aklan. In this regard, the temporary closure 
of the Island as a tourist destination for six (6) months starting 26 
April 2018, or until 25 October 2018, is hereby ordered, subject to 
applicable laws, rules, regulations and jurisprudence. 


  Concerned government agencies shall, as may be necessary or 
appropriate, undertake the remedial measures during a State of Calamity 
as provided in RA No. 10121 and other applicable laws, rules and 
regulations, such as control of the prices of basic goods and 
commodities for the affected areas, employment of negotiated procurement
 and utilization of appropriate funds, including the National Disaster 
Risk Reduction and Management Fund, for relief and rehabilitation 
efforts in the area. All departments and other concerned government 
agencies are also hereby directed to coordinate with and provide or 
augment the basic services and facilities of affected local government 
units, if necessary. 


 The State of Calamity in the Island of Boracay shall remain in 
force and effect until lifted by the President, notwithstanding the 
lapse of the six-month closure period. 


 All departments, agencies and offices, including government-owned 
or controlled corporations and affected local government units are 
hereby directed to implement and execute the abovementioned closure and 
the appropriate rehabilitation works, in accordance with pertinent 
operational plans and directives, including the Boracay Action Plan. 


 The Philippine National Police, the Philippine Coast Guard and 
other law enforcement agencies, with the support of the Armed Forces of 
the Philippines, are hereby directed to act with restraint and within 
the bounds of the law in the strict implementation of the closure of the
 Island and ensuring peace and order in the area. 


 The Municipality of Malay, Aklan is also hereby directed to ensure
 that no tourist will be allowed entry to the Island of Boracay until 
such time that the closure has been lifted by the President. 


 All tourists, residents and establishment owners in the area are 
also urged to act within the bounds of the law and to comply with the 
directives herein provided for the rehabilitation and restoration of the
 ecological balance of the Island which will be for the benefit of all 
concerned.
[46]
 (Emphasis in the original) 




 The enacting clause declares a temporary closure of the island for 
six (6) months yet the third clause provides that the state of calamity 
is open ended and without a time limit. Nothing in the Proclamation 
justifies the period of six (6) months for the closure. The second 
paragraph after the enacting clause also suggests that the temporary 
closure may be extended because the state of calamity is indefinite. 
Thus: 



 The State of Calamity in the Island of Boracay shall remain in 
force and effect until lifted by the President, notwithstanding the 
lapse of the six-month closure period.
[47]
 




 The first paragraph after the enacting clause mentions general 
remedial measures to be done by the Executive. All government agencies 
are mandated to assist in the yet to be publicly declared programs and 
activities during the closure. 
 The third paragraph after the 
enacting clause only refers to "the appropriate rehabilitation works, in
 accordance with pertinent operational plans and directives, including 
the Boracay Action Plan." None of these plans however were attached to 
the proclamation and none were presented here by the Office of the 
Solicitor General on behalf of the government. 
 The fourth 
paragraph after the enacting clause refers to a policy of restraint for 
law enforcement agencies. The fifth paragraph after the enacting clause 
refers to the ban for tourists to sojourn into the island without 
providing for the reasons why all tourists shall be banned. It also does
 not contain the standard for restrictions, if any, for tourism should 
the island be partially opened. 
 The sixth paragraph after the 
enacting clause is addressed to the residents and owners to comply with 
the directives for the rehabilitation of the island. Those aggrieved are
 not provided with a procedure for raising their claims to their 
livelihood and properties. There is no process to address any objections
 to the hidden projects or activities that are not mentioned in the 
Proclamation. 
 Proclamation No. 475 is eerily similar to the vagueness of the Martial Law Proclamation in the recent case of 
Lagman v Medialdea.
[48]
 We recall our discussion on void-for-vagueness: 



 The doctrine of void for vagueness is a ground for invalidating a statute or a governmental regulation for being 
vague
.
 The doctrine requires that a statute be sufficiently explicit as to 
inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will 
render them liable to its penalties. In 
Southern Hemisphere v. Anti-Terrorism Council
: 




 A statute or act suffers from the defect of vagueness when it 
lacks comprehensible standards that men of common intelligence must 
necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application. It is
 repugnant to the Constitution in two respects: (1) it violates due 
process for failure to accord persons, especially the parties targeted 
by it, fair notice of the conduct to avoid; and (2) it leaves law 
enforcers unbridled discretion in carrying out its provisions and 
becomes an arbitrary flexing of the Government muscle. 




 In 
People of the Philippines v. Piedra
, the Court 
explained that the rationale behind the doctrine is to give a person of 
ordinary intelligence a fair notice that his or her contemplated conduct
 is forbidden by the statute or the regulation. Thus, a statute must be 
declared void and unconstitutional when it is so indefinite that it 
encourages arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions. 


 In 
Estrada v. Sandiganbayan
, the Court limited the application of the doctrine in cases where the statute is "
utterly vague on its face, i.e.

 that which cannot be clarified by a saving clause or construction." 
Thus, when a statute or act lacks comprehensible standards that men of 
common intelligence must necessarily guess its meaning and differ in its
 application, the doctrine may be invoked: 




 Hence, it cannot plausibly be contended that the law does not 
give a fair warning and sufficient notice of what it seeks to penalize. 
Under the circumstances, petitioner's reliance on the 
"void-for-vagueness" doctrine is manifestly misplaced. The doctrine has 
been formulated in various ways, but is most commonly stated to the 
effect that a statute establishing a criminal offense must define the 
offense with sufficient definiteness that persons of ordinary 
intelligence can understand what conduct is prohibited by the statute. 
It can only be invoked against that specie of legislation that is 
utterly vague on its face,
 i.e
., that which cannot be clarified either by a saving clause or by construction. 


 A statute or act may be said to be vague when it lacks 
comprehensible standards that men of common intelligence must 
necessarily guess at its meaning and differ in its application. In such 
instance, the statute is repugnant to the Constitution in two (2) 
respects â it violates due process for failure to accord persons, 
especially the parties targeted by it, fair notice of what conduct to 
avoid; and, it leaves law enforcers unbridled discretion in carrying out
 its provisions and becomes an arbitrary flexing of the Government 
muscle. But the doctrine does not apply as against legislations that are
 merely couched in imprecise language but which nonetheless specify a 
standard though defectively phrased; or to those that are apparently 
ambiguous yet fairly applicable to certain types of activities. The 
first may be "saved" by proper construction, while no challenge may be 
mounted as against the second whenever directed against such activities.
 With more reason, the doctrine cannot be invoked where the assailed 
statute is clear and free from ambiguity, as in this case. 




 In 
Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc. v. AntiÂ­-Terrorism Council
, the Court clarified that the void for vagueness doctrine may only be invoked in 
as-applied
 cases. The Court explained:




 While
 Estrada 
did not apply the overbreadth doctrine, it did not preclude the operation of the vagueness test on the Anti-Plunder Law 
as applied

 to the therein petitioner, finding, however, that there was no basis to
 review the law "on its face and in its entirety." It stressed that 
"statutes found vague 
as a matter of due process
 typically are invalidated only 'as applied' to a particular defendant."




 However, in 
Disini v. Secretary of Justice
, the Court 
extended the application of the doctrine even to facial challenges, 
ruling that "when a penal statute encroaches upon the freedom of speech,
 a facial challenge grounded on the void-for-vagueness doctrine is 
acceptable." Thus, by this pronouncement the void for vagueness doctrine
 may also now be invoked in facial challenges as long as what it 
involved is freedom of speech.


 On the other hand, the void for overbreadth doctrine applies when 
the statute or the act "offends the constitutional principle that a 
governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally 
subject to state regulations may not be achieved by means which sweep 
unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected 
freedoms."


 In 
Adiong v. Commission on Elections
, the Court applied the
 doctrine in relation to the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. 
Thus, in Adiong, the Commission on Elections issued a Resolution 
prohibiting the posting of decals and stickers not more than eight and 
one-half (8 Â½) inches in width and fourteen (14) inches in length
 in any place, including mobile places whether public or private
 except in areas designated by the COMELEC. The Court characterized the regulation as void for being "so broad," thus: 




 Verily, the restriction as to where the decals and stickers 
should be posted is so broad that it encompasses even the citizen's 
private property, which in this case is a privately-owned vehicle. In 
consequence of this prohibition, another cardinal rule prescribed by the
 Constitution would be violated. Section 1, Article III of the Bill of 
Rights provides "that no person shall be deprived of his property 
without due process of law." 


 Property is more than the mere thing which a person owns, it includes the right to acquire,
 use
, and dispose of it; and the Constitution, in the 14th Amendment, protects these essential attributes. 


 Property is more than the mere thing which a person owns. It is 
elementary that it includes the right to acquire, use, and dispose of 
it. The Constitution protects these essential attributes of property. . .
  Property consists of the free use, enjoyment, and disposal of a 
person's acquisitions without control or diminution save by the law of 
the land. 




  In 
Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc. v. AntiÂ­Terrorism Council
,
 the Court held that the application of the overbreadth doctrine is 
limited only to free speech cases due to the rationale of a facial 
challenge. The Court explained: 




 By its nature, the overbreadth doctrine has to necessarily apply
 a facial type of invalidation in order to plot areas of protected 
speech, inevitably almost always under situations not before the court, 
that are impermissibly swept by the substantially overbroad regulation. 
Otherwise stated, a statute cannot be properly analyzed for being 
substantially overbroad if the court confines itself only to facts as 
applied to the litigants. 




 The Court ruled that as regards the application of the overbreadth
 doctrine, it is limited only to "a facial kind of challenge and, owing 
to the given rationale of a facial challenge, applicable only to free 
speech cases." 


 The Court's pronouncements in 
Disini v. Secretary of Justice
 is also premised on the same tenor. Thus, it held: 




 Also, the charge of invalidity of this section based on the 
overbreadth doctrine will not hold water since the specific conducts 
proscribed 
do not intrude into guaranteed freedoms like speech
.
 Clearly, what this section regulates are specific actions: the 
acquisition, use, misuse or deletion of personal identifying data of 
another. There is no fundamental right to acquire another's personal 
data. 

      . . . . 
    


 But this rule admits of exceptions. 
A petitioner may for	
instance	mount	a "facial" challenge	to 	the constitutionality of a 
statute even if he claims no violation of his own rights under the 
assailed statute where it involves free speech on grounds	of overbreadth
 or vagueness of the statute
. The rationale for this exception is 
to counter the "chilling effect" on protected speech that comes from 
statutes violating free speech. A person who does not know whether his 
speech constitutes a crime under an overbroad or vague law may simply 
restrain himself from speaking in order to avoid being charged of a 
crime. The overbroad or vague law thus chills him into silence. 




 It is true that in his Dissenting Opinion in
 Estrada v. Sandiganbayan
, Justice V.V. Mendoza expressed the view that "the overbreadth and vagueness doctrines then have special application 
only to free speech cases
. They are inapt for testing the validity of penal statutes." 


 However, the Court already clarified in 
Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc., v. Anti-Terrorism Council
,
 that the primary criterion in the application of the doctrine is not 
whether the case is a freedom of speech case, but rather, whether the 
case involves an as-applied or a facial challenge. The Court clarified: 




  The confusion apparently stems from the interlocking relation of the 
overbreadth and vagueness
 doctrines as grounds for a
 facial
 or
 as-applied

 challenge against a penal statute (under a claim of violation of due 
process of law) or a speech regulation (under a claim of abridgement of 
the freedom of speech and cognate rights). 


 To be sure, the doctrine of vagueness and the doctrine of overbreadth do not operate on the same plane. 


. . . .


 The allowance of a facial challenge in free speech cases is 
justified by the aim to avert the chilling effect on protected speech, 
the exercise of which should not at all times be abridged. As reflected 
earlier, this rationale is inapplicable to plain penal statutes that 
generally bear an 
in terrorem
 effect in deterring socially 
harmful conduct. In fact, the legislature may even forbid and penalize 
acts formerly considered innocent and lawful, so long as it refrains 
from diminishing or dissuading the exercise of constitutionally 
protected rights. 




 The Court then concluded that due to the rationale of a facial 
challenge, the overbreadth doctrine is applicable only to free speech 
cases. Thus: 




 By its nature, the overbreadth doctrine has to necessarily apply
 a facial type of invalidation in order to plot areas of protected 
speech, inevitably almost always under situations not before the court, 
that are impermissibly swept by the substantially overbroad regulation. 
Otherwise stated, a statute cannot be properly analyzed for being 
substantially overbroad if the court confines itself only to facts as 
applied to the litigants. 


. . . . 


 In restricting the overbreadth doctrine to free speech claims, 
the Court, in at least two cases, observed that the US Supreme Court has
 not recognized an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of 
the First Amendment, and that claims of facial overbreadth have been 
entertained in cases involving statutes which, by their terms, seek to 
regulate only 
spoken words
. In 
Virginia v. Hicks,
 it was
 held that rarely, if ever, will an overbreadth challenge succeed 
against a law or regulation that is not specifically addressed to 
speech
 or 
speech-related conduct
.
 Attacks on overly broad statutes are justified by the "transcendent 
value to all society of constitutionally protected expression." 




 As regards the application of the void for vagueness doctrine, the
 Court held that vagueness challenges must be examined in light of the 
specific facts of the case and not with regard to the statute's facial 
validity. Notably, the case need not be a freedom of speech case as the 
Court cited previous cases where the doctrine was applied: 




 In this jurisdiction, the void-for-vagueness doctrine asserted 
under the due process clause has been utilized in examining the 
constitutionality of criminal statutes. In at least three cases, the 
Court brought the doctrine into play in analyzing an ordinance 
penalizing the non-payment of municipal tax on fishponds, the crime of 
illegal recruitment punishable under Article 132 (b) of the Labor Code, 
and the vagrancy provision under Article 202 (2) of the Revised Penal 
Code. Notably, the petitioners in these three cases, similar to those in
 the two 
Romualdez
 and 
Estrada
 cases, were actually charged with the therein assailed penal statute, unlike in the present case. 




 From these pronouncements, it is clear that what is relevant in 
the application of the void-for-vagueness doctrine is not whether it is a
 freedom of speech case, but rather whether it violates the Due Process 
Clause of the Constitution for failure to accord persons a fair notice 
of which conduct to avoid; and whether it leaves law enforcers unbridled
 discretion in carrying out their functions.
[49]
 (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) 




 
V
 The inability of the Proclamation to 
provide fair notice and "whether it leaves law enforcers unbridled 
discretion in carrying out their function"
[50]
 is readily demonstrated by the contradiction in the provisions of the Proclamation with existing laws. 
 The Civil Code acknowledges the concept of nuisance, thus: 



 ARTICLE 694. A nuisance is any act, omission, establishment, business, condition of property, or anything else which: 




 (1) Injures or endangers the health or safety of others; or
 
      (2) Annoys or offends the senses; or
 
      (3) Shocks, defies or disregards decency or morality; or
 
      (4) Obstructs or interferes with the free passage of any public highway or street, or any body of water; or
 
      (5) Hinders or impairs the use of property. 




 ARTICLE 695. Nuisance is either public or private. A public 
nuisance affects a community or neighborhood or any considerable number 
of persons, although the extent of the annoyance, danger or damage upon 
individuals may be unequal. A private nuisance is one that is not 
included in the foregoing definition. 




 The responsibility to abate a nuisance lies with the owner or possessor of a property: 



 ARTICLE 696. Every successive owner or possessor of property who 
fails or refuses to abate a nuisance in that property started by a 
former owner or possessor is liable therefor in the same manner as the 
one who created it. 


 ARTICLE 697. The abatement of a nuisance does not preclude the 
right of any person injured to recover damages for its past existence.
[51]
 




 Being a public nuisance, the remedy for the discharge of coliform 
within private properties or properties possessed by private persons 
are: 



 ARTICLE 699. The remedies against a public nuisance are: 


 (1) A prosecution under the Penal Code or any local ordinance: or
 
    (2) A civil action; or
 
    (3) Abatement, without judicial proceedings.
[52]
 




 Abatement of a public nuisance is provided, thus: 



 ARTICLE 698. Lapse of time cannot legalize any nuisance, whether public or private. 


 ARTICLE 700. The district health officer shall take care that one 
or all of the remedies against a public nuisance are availed of. 


 ARTICLE 701. If a civil action is brought by reason of the 
maintenance of a public nuisance, such action shall be commenced by the 
city or municipal mayor. 


 ARTICLE 702. The district health officer shall determine whether 
or not abatement, without judicial proceedings, is the best remedy 
against a public nuisance. 


 ARTICLE 703. A private person may file an action on account of a public nuisance, if it is specially injurious to himself. 


 ARTICLE 704. Any private person may abate a public nuisance which 
is specially injurious to him by removing, or if necessary, by 
destroying the thing which constitutes the same, without committing a 
breach of the peace, or doing unnecessary injury. But it is necessary: 




 (1) That demand be first made upon the owner or possessor of the property to abate the nuisance;


 (2) That such demand has been rejected; 


 (3) That the abatement be approved by the district health officer and executed with the assistance of the local police; and


 (4) That the value of the destruction does not exceed three thousand pesos.
[53]






 Nothing in the Proclamation relates to or is in accordance with these statutory procedures and standards of the Civil Code. 
 Significantly, the Proclamation also contravenes Republic Act No. 9275 or the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004. 

 Section 6 of the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004 provides a 
systematic procedure for the management of water bodies which are 
heavily polluted or referred to as "non-attainment areas.'' Thus: 



 SECTION 6. 
Management of Non-attainment Areas
. â The 
Department shall designate water bodies, or portions thereof, where 
specific pollutants from either natural or man-made source have already 
exceeded water quality guidelines as non-attainment areas for the 
exceeded pollutants. It shall prepare and implement a program that will 
not allow new sources of exceeded water pollutant in non-attainment 
areas without a corresponding reduction in discharges from existing 
sources: 
Provided
, That if the pollutant is naturally occurring, 
e.g. naturally high boron and other elements in geothermal areas, 
discharge of such pollutant may be allowed: 
Provided, further
, That the effluent concentration of discharge shall not exceed the naturally occurring level of such pollutant in the area: 
Provided, finally
,
 That the effluent concentration and volume of discharge shall not 
adversely affect water supply, public health and ecological protection.


 The Department shall, in coordination with NWRB, Department of 
Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture (DA), governing board and other 
concerned government agencies and private sectors shall take such 
measures as may be necessary to upgrade the quality of such water in 
nonÂ­ attainment areas to meet the standards under which it has been 
classified. 


 Upgrading of water quality shall likewise include undertakings 
which shall improve the water quality of a water body to a 
classification that will meet its projected or potential use. 


 The LGUs shall prepare and implement contingency plans and other 
measures including relocation, whenever necessary, for the protection of
 health and welfare of the residents within potentially affected areas. 




 Complementing these procedures to identify heavily polluted waters, 
and therefore considered non-attainment areas, are the enforcement 
mechanisms in the law. Should clean-up of the waters become necessary, 
Section 16 of Republic Act No. 9275 will apply, thus: 



 SECTION 16. 
Clean-Up Operations
. â Notwithstanding the 
provisions of Sections 15 and 26 hereof, any person who causes pollution
 in or pollutes water bodies in excess of the applicable and prevailing 
standards shall be responsible to contain, remove and clean-up any 
pollution incident at his own expense to the extent that the same water 
bodies have been rendered unfit for utilization and beneficial use: 
Provided,

 That in the event emergency clean-up operations are necessary and the 
polluter fails to immediately undertake the same, the Department, in 
coordination with other government agencies concerned, shall conduct 
containment, removal and clean-up operations. Expenses incurred in said 
operations shall be reimbursed by the persons found to have caused such 
pollution upon proper administrative determination in accordance with 
this Act. Reimbursements of the cost incurred shall be made to the Water
 Quality Management Fund or to such other funds where said disbursements
 were sourced. 




 This applies to the containment, removal, and clean-up operations 
for the body of water that is polluted. To prevent further discharge 
from a private source, Section 27 of Republic Act No. 9275 prohibits: 



 SECTION 27. 
Prohibited Acts
. â The following acts are hereby prohibited:








a)


Discharging, depositing or 
causing to be deposited material of any kind directly or indirectly into
 the water bodies or along the margins of any surface water, where, the 
same shall be liable to be washed into such surface water, either by 
tide action or by storm, floods or otherwise, which could cause water 
pollution or impede natural flow in the water body;






 






. . . . 






 


 






e)


Unauthorized transport or dumping into sea waters of sewage sludge or solid waste as defined under Republic Act No. 9003; 






 






. . . . 






 


 






g)


Operate facilities that discharge or 
allow to seep, willfully or through gross negligence, prohibited 
chemicals, substances or pollutants listed under Republic Act No. 6969, 
into water bodies or wherein the same shall be liable to be washed into 
such surface, ground, coastal, and marine water;






 


 






h)


Undertaking activities or development 
and expansion of projects, or operating wastewater/sewerage facilities 
in violation of Presidential Decree No. 1586 and its implementing rules 
and regulations;






 


 






i)


Discharging regulated water pollutants 
without the valid required discharge permit pursuant to this Act or 
after the permit was revoked or any violation of any condition therein;






 


 






j)


Noncompliance of the LGU with the Water
 Quality Framework and Management Area Action Plan. In such a case, 
sanctions shall be imposed on the local government officials concerned; 






 


 






k)


Refusal to allow entry, inspection and monitoring by the Department in accordance with this Act; 






 


 






l)


Refusal to allow access by the Department to relevant reports and records in accordance with this Act;






 


 






m)


Refusal or failure to submit reports whenever required by the Department in accordance with this Act;






 






. . . . 






 


 






o)


Directly using booster pumps in the 
distribution system or tampering with the water supply in such a way as 
to alter or impair the water quality.










Section 28 of the same law provides further enforcement mechanisms: 




 SECTION 28. 
Fines, Damages and Penalties
. â Unless 
otherwise provided herein, any person who commits any of the prohibited 
acts provided in the immediately preceding section or violates any of 
the provision of this Act or its implementing rules and regulations, 
shall be fined by the Secretary, upon the recommendation of the PAB in 
the amount of not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) nor more 
than Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00) for every day of 
violation. The fines herein prescribed shall be increased by ten percent
 (10%) every two (2) years to compensate for inflation and to maintain 
the deterrent function of such fines: 
Provided, That the Secretary, 
upon recommendation of the PAB may order the closure, suspension of 
development or construction, or cessation of operations or, where 
appropriate disconnection of water supply, until such time that proper 
environmental safeguards are put in place and/or compliance with this 
Act or its rules and regulations are undertaken. This paragraph shall be
 without prejudice to the issuance of an ex parte order for such 
closure, suspension of development or construction, or cessation of 
operations during the pendency of the case. 


 Failure to undertake clean-up operations, willfully, or through 
gross negligence, shall be punished by imprisonment of not less than two
 (2) years and not more than four (4) years and a fine not less than 
Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) and not more than One hundred thousand
 pesos (P100,000.00) per day for each day of violation. Such failure or 
refusal which results in serious injury or loss of life and/or 
irreversible water contamination of surface, ground, coastal and marine 
water shall be punished with imprisonment of not less than six (6) years
 and one (1) day and not more than twelve (12) years, and a fine of Five
 hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) per day for each day during which 
the omission and/or contamination continues. 


 In case of gross violation of this Act, the PAB shall issue a 
resolution recommending that the proper government agencies tile 
criminal charges against the violators. (Emphasis supplied) 




 The Department of Environment and Natural Resources is only 
authorized by the Clean Water Act to order closures of operations when 
recommended by the Pollution Adjudicatory Board, or when the latter 
files an 
ex parte 
order before a court. 
 It is the 
Pollution Adjudicatory Board, not the President or the Department of 
Environment and Natural Resources, that has specific jurisdiction over 
the Clean Water Act:
[54]
 
 
RULE III
 
Jurisdiction and Authority of the Board




SECTION 1. JURISDICTION OF THE BOARD


. . . . 


 B. Specific Jurisdiction. â Notwithstanding the general 
jurisdiction of the Board over adjudication of pollution cases, and all 
matters related thereto, the Board has specific jurisdiction, over the 
following cases: 


. . . . 


 2. Clean Water Act (RA 9275) 


The PAB has the 
exclusive and original jurisdiction
 with 
respect to adjudication of pollution cases based on exceedance of the 
DENR Effluent Standards and other acts defined as prohibited under 
Section 27 of R.A. 9275. (Emphasis supplied) 




 Should it be necessary, the issuance of Cease and Desist Orders are 
provided in the Pollution Adjudication Board Resolution No. 001-10 or 
the Revised Rules of Procedure of the Pollution Adjudicatory Board, 
thus: 
 
RULE X


Orders, Resolutions and Decisions




 SECTION 1. 
Cease and Desist Order
. â Whenever the Board finds 
prima facie

 evidence that the emission or discharge of pollutants constitutes an 
immediate threat to life, public health, safety or welfare, or to animal
 or plant life, or exceeds the allowable DENR Standards, it may issue or
 recommend to the DENR Secretary an 
ex-parte order
 directing 
the discontinuance of the same or the temporary suspension or cessation 
of operation of the establishment or person generating such pollutants, 
without need of a prior public hearing. 


 The Cease and Desist Order (CDO) shall be immediately executory 
and shall remain in force and effect until modified or lifted by the 
Board or the DENR Secretary. 


 The Board or the DENR Secretary may also direct the Regional 
Office to revoke, suspend or modify any permit to operate a pollution 
control facility or any clearance whenever such is necessary to prevent 
or abate the pollution. 


 SECTION 2. 
Cease and Desist Order against Whom Issued
. â A
 CDO shall be issued against the respondent for the purpose of directing
 it to immediately stop or refrain from doing or conducting an act, or 
continuing a particular activity or course of action in violation of 
environmental laws, such as, but not limited to, the operation of a 
particular machine, equipment, process or activity, or doing a 
particular act expressly prohibited by law. 


. . . . 


 SECTION 4. 
Board Action on Interim Cease and Desist Order
.
 â Where an interim CDO effective for seven (7) days has been issued by 
the Regional Director, the Board shall issue a Cease and Desist Order or
 recommend to the Secretary the issuance of a CDO, pursuant to the 
provisions of the applicable law. 


 SECTION 5. 
Remedy of Respondent
. â The respondent may 
contest the order by filing with the Board a motion to lift the CDO, 
with proof of service of copies thereof on the Regional Office and the 
parties concerned. 


 The Board shall direct the Regional Office which has jurisdiction 
over the case and the parties concerned to file their comment to the 
motion within five (5) days from receipt thereof, copy-furnished the 
respondent. Thereafter, the motion shall be set for hearing or 
calendared for the Board's deliberation. The filing of such motion shall
 not stay the enforcement and execution of the CDO. 


 SECTION 6. 
Implementation of Cease and Desist Order
. â The 
Regional Director or his duly authorized representative, in coordination
 with the Regional Executive Director (RED) shall implement or cause the
 implementation of the Cease and Desist Order no later than seventy-two 
(72) hours from receipt thereof. He shall submit to the Board a report 
within forty-eight (48) hours after the completion of the 
implementation, stating therein the actions taken. Should the Cease and 
Desist Order be implemented beyond seventy-two (72) hours or cannot be 
implemented, the Regional Director shall submit a written report to the 
Board stating therein the causes of delay or failure to execute the 
same. 


  The implementing team shall be designated by the Regional Director. 


 In the implementation of Cease and Desist Orders, the Regional Director shall observe the following guidelines: 


 1. Upon issuance or receipt of the CDO by the Board, the EMB 
Regional Director or his duly authorized representative shall inform the
 local government unit (province/municipality/city) concerned regarding 
the implementation thereof by furnishing it with copies of the Orders 
received from the Board; 


 2. Upon arrival at the respondent's premises, the implementing 
team shall present proper identification as well as its mission Order 
duly signed by the EMB Regional Director; 


 3. The head of the implementing team shall serve the CDO on the 
Managing Head and the Pollution Control Officer, or in their absence to 
any person in charge, by thoroughly explaining to them the contents 
thereof; 


 4. The team shall proceed with the execution of the CDO by 
padlocking and sealing the source responsible for generating the 
effluent or emission, and thereafter requesting the Managing Head and 
the Pollution Control Officer to affix their signatures to the duplicate
 copy of the CDO as proof of service; 


 5. Should there be refusal on the part of the respondent to have 
the CDO implemented, the head of the implementing team shall report such
 incident to the EMB Regional Director, without prejudice to such 
respondent being declared in contempt and other criminal liability under
 relevant laws; 


 6. The Regional Director, whenever it is deemed necessary, may 
seek the assistance of the Local Government Units (LGUs) and/or 
Philippine National Police (PNP) through its PNP Regional Director. The 
written communication shall state the urgency of having the CDO 
implemented within the seventy-two (72) hour period as prescribed in the
 existing Rules; 


 7. The LGUs and/or the PNP together with the same implementing 
team may break into respondent's premises for the purpose of 
implementing the CDO in accordance with number four (4) above; and


 8. Upon serving of the CDO, the Regional Office shall document the
 same by taking of photographs and/or videos and thereafter advising 
respondent that removing or breaking the padlocks and seals constitutes 
is a criminal offense punishable by existing environmental laws, rules 
and regulations without prejudice to such respondent being declared in 
contempt and other liability under relevant laws. 


 SECTION 7. 
Show Cause Order
. â Instead of issuing a CDO, 
the Board may opt to direct respondent to Show Cause why no CDO should 
be issued against it, subject to these criteria: 


  1. The results of a series of effluent samplings shows a marked decrease in the values of the relevant parameters; or


 2. The values of the relevant parameters are not far from the DENR Standards. 




 These 	statutory	framework	and	mechanisms	are	absent 	in the Proclamation. 
 Recalling the enabling clause of the Proclamation: 



 NOW, THEREFORE, I, RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE, President of the 
Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution 
and existing laws, do hereby declare a State of Calamity in the 
barangays of Balabag, Manoc-Manoc and Yapak (Island of Boracay) in the 
Municipality of Malay, Aklan. In this regard, the temporary closure of 
the Island as a tourist destination for six (6) months starting 26 April
 2018, or until 25 October 2018, is hereby ordered, subject to 
applicable laws, rules, regulations and jurisprudence. 


 Concerned government agencies shall, as may be necessary or 
appropriate, undertake the remedial measures during a State of Calamity 
as provided in RA No. 10121 and other applicable laws, rules and 
regulations, such as control of the prices of basic goods and 
commodities for the affected areas, employment of negotiated procurement
 and utilization of appropriate funds, including the National Disaster 
Risk Reduction and Management Fund, for relief and rehabilitation 
efforts in the area. All departments and other concerned government 
agencies are also hereby directed to coordinate with and provide or 
augment the basic services and facilities of affected local government 
units, if necessary. 


. . . . 


 All departments, agencies and offices, including governmentÂ­owned 
or controlled corporations and affected local government units are 
hereby directed to implement and execute the abovementioned closure and 
the appropriate rehabilitation works, in accordance with pertinent 
operational plans and directives, including the Boracay Action Plan. 


. . . . 


 The Municipality of Malay, Aklan is also hereby directed to ensure
 that no tourist will be allowed entry to the Island of Boracay until 
such time that the closure has been lifted by the President. 


 All tourists, residents and establishment owners in the area are 
also urged to act within the bounds of the law and to comply with the 
directives herein provided for the rehabilitation and restoration of the
 ecological balance of the Island which will be for the benefit of all 
concerned. 




 The Proclamation makes two (2) basic and broad sets of directives to all agencies. 

 The first set relates to prices of basic goods, employment of 
procurement, and disbursement of funds, and for relief and 
rehabilitation. This is contained in the first paragraph after the 
enabling clause, thus: 



 All departments and other concerned government agencies are also 
hereby directed to coordinate with and provide or augment the basic 
services and facilities of affected local government units, if any. 




 The second set of directives relate to "appropriate rehabilitation 
works" where the primacy of "pertinent action plans and directives," 
including a "Boracay Action Plan," not appended to the Proclamation, is 
mentioned. Thus: 



 All departments, agencies and offices, including governmentÂ­ owned
 or controlled corporations and affected local government units are 
hereby directed to implement and execute the abovementioned closure and 
the appropriate rehabilitation works, in accordance with pertinent 
operational plans and directives, including the Boracay Action Plan. 




 The Proclamation completely negates the framework of enforcement and implementation of Republic Act No. 9275. 
 The form of the Presidential action contributes to its vagueness. 

 Executive Order No. 292 or the Administrative Code makes a clear 
distinction between an Executive Order and a Proclamation, thus: 



 SECTION 2. 
Executive Orders
. â Acts of the President 
providing for rules of a general or permanent character in 
implementation or execution of constitutional or statutory powers shall 
be promulgated in executive orders. 


. . . .


 SECTION 4. 
Proclamations
. â Acts of the President fixing a
 date or declaring a status or condition of public moment or interest, 
upon the existence of which the operation of a specific law or 
regulation is made to depend, shall be promulgated in proclamations 
which shall have the force of an executive order. 




 The Presidential action is in the form of a Proclamation, which 
appears to state a "status or condition," namely a "state of calamity," 
intending to signal the operation of Republic Act No. 10121 or Republic 
Act No. 9275.
[55]
 However, as 
demonstrated, the provisions of the Proclamation amends the framework 
and implementation of the Civil Code and the Clean Water Act. 
 
VI
 Thirdly, the Proclamation transgresses due process of law in that it is not based on Republic Act No. 10121. 

 The majority finds that Proclamation No. 475 is in the nature of a 
valid police power measure. It defined police power as the "state 
authority to enact legislation that may interfere with personal liberty 
or property in order to promote general welfare."
[56]

 Police power does not need to be supported by the Constitution since 
"it is inborn in the very fact of statehood and sovereignty."
[57]
 

 A valid exercise of police power by the President requires that it be 
exercised within the framework of both the Constitution and statutes. 
 In 
David v. Arroyo
,
[58]

 this Court invalidated Presidential Decree No. 1017 insofar as the 
president is granted authority to promulgate "decrees." Legislative 
power is vested solely in the legislature. Our Constitution provides: 
 Article VI 

The Legislative Department



 SECTION 1. The legislative power shall be vested in the Congress 
of the Philippines which shall consist of a Senate and a House of 
Representatives, except to the extent reserved to the people by the 
provision on initiative and referendum. 




 To determine whether there is a valid delegation of legislative 
power, it must pass the completeness test and the sufficient standard 
test. The first test requires that the law must be complete in all its 
terms and conditions when it leaves the legislature, so much so that 
when it reaches the delegate, the only thing left is to enforce the law.
 The second test requires adequate guidelines in law to provide the 
boundaries of the delegate's authority.
[59]
 
 These tests ensure that the delegate does not step into the shoes of the legislature and exercise legislative power.
[60]
 In 
Belgica v. Ochoa
,
[61]

 this Court reminded the parties that "the powers of the government must
 be divided to avoid concentration of these powers in any one branch, 
the division, it is hoped, would avoid any single branch from lording 
its power over the other branches of the citizenry."
[62]
 
 The majority, accepting the premise of respondents, cites Republic Act No. 10121
[63]
 as statutory basis for the validity of Proclamation No. 475. Such reliance is erroneous. 
 Republic Act No. 1 0121 defines state of calamity as: 



 SECTION 3. Definition of Terms. â For purposes of this Act, the following shall refer to:




 . . . .






(ll)


"State of Calamity"âa 
condition involving mass casualty and/or major damages to property, 
disruption of means of livelihoods, roads and normal way of life of 
people in the affected areas as a result of the occurrence of natural or
 human-induced hazard
. (Emphasis supplied)










Not all man-made intrusions and pollution into our environment 
justify as severe an intervention as the "state of calamity envisioned 
in Republic Act 10121. The environmental disaster must (a) be of such 
gravity, (b) its cause so known that (c) the response required under 
that law IS necessary. 


 The imminence of mass casualty or major damage to property or 
disruption of the means of livelihoods and the normal life of the people
 must be demonstrated. Any action of human beings may cause the 
unintended consequences of affecting whole communities. The profligate 
use of plastics is affecting our oceans and endangering our fish stock. 
The pervasiveness of livestock and the demand for meat may be causing 
the release of inordinate amounts of carbon and methane causing climate 
change. The release of anthropogenic gases and other human activities 
causing climate change have resulted in scientists warning that the 
"sixth mass extinction event" for our planet may be underway.
[64]
 

 Yet, not all of this evolving disastersâas the disaster involving fecal
 coliform in the beaches of Boracayâwould be the state of calamity 
envisioned by Republic Act No. 10121. Rather, the problem of coliform 
formation may be due to many other factors that should be addressed by 
our building codes, sanitation codes, and other environmental laws. Each
 of these laws provide the means of redress as well as the process of 
weeding out the source of the disasters. Furthermore, in situations 
where the violations are rampant, the government may also want to invoke
 our anti-corruption laws to weed out the causes at its roots. 
 
The nature of the calamity envisioned by Republic Act No. 10121 can be 
further discerned not only from the nature of the acts prohibited. 
Section 19 of the law provides: 



 SECTION 19. Prohibited Acts. â Any person, group or corporation 
who commits any of the following prohibited acts shall be held liable 
and be subjected to the penalties as prescribed in Section 20 of this 
Act:








(a)


Dereliction of duties which leads to destruction, loss of lives, critical damage of facilities and misuse of funds;






 


 






(b)


Preventing the entry and 
distribution of relief goods in disasterÂ­stricken areas, including 
appropriate technology, tools, equipment, accessories, disaster 
teams/experts;






 


 






(c)


Buying, for consumption or 
resale, from disaster relief agencies any relief goods, equipment or 
other aid commodities which are intended for distribution to disaster 
affected communities;






 


 






(d)


Buying, for consumption or 
resale, from the recipient disaster affected persons any relief goods, 
equipment or other aid commodities received by them;






 


 






(e)


Selling of relief goods, equipment or other aid commodities which are intended for distribution to disaster victims;






 


 






(f)


Forcibly seizing relief 
goods, equipment or other aid commodities intended for or consigned to a
 specific group of victims or relief agency;






 


 






(g)


Diverting or misdelivery of
 relief goods, equipment or other aid commodities to persons other than 
the rightful recipient or consignee;






 


 






(h)


Accepting, possessing, 
using or disposing relief goods, equipment or other aid commodities not 
intended for nor consigned to him/her;






 


 






(i)


Misrepresenting the source of relief goods, equipment or other aid commodities by:






 


 


 








(1)


Either covering, replacing or defacing 
the labels of the containers to make it appear that the goods, equipment
 or other aid commodities came from another agency or persons;






 


 


 








(2)


Repacking the goods, equipment or other
 aid commodities into containers with different markings to make it 
appear that the goods, came from another agency or persons or was 
released upon the instance of a particular agency or persons;






 


 


 








(3)


 
Making false verbal claim 
that the goods, equipment or other aid commodity in its untampered 
original containers actually came from another agency or persons or was 
released upon the instance of a particular agency or persons;






 


 






(j)


Substituting or replacing relief goods, equipment or other aid commodities with the same items or inferior/cheaper quality;






 


 






(k)


Illegal solicitations by 
persons or organizations representing others as defined in the standards
 and guidelines set by the NDRRMC;






 


 






(l)


Deliberate use of false or 
inflated data in support of the request for funding, relief goods, 
equipment or other aid commodities for emergency assistance or 
livelihood projects; and






 


 






(m)


Tampering with or stealing hazard monitoring and disaster preparedness equipment and paraphernalia.










 The nature of the contingency for the state of calamity envisioned 
in Republic Act No. 10121 is such that casualties have actually been 
suffered and property actually damaged. This may take the form of 
typhoons, tsunamis, or earthquakes where government's relief is needed. 
It does not include human induced ecological disasters like the 
formation of fecal coliform on our beaches, which requires a more 
systematic, deliberate, structural, and institutional approach. 


 
VII
 The express and implied powers contained in the Proclamation exceeds that which is granted by Republic Act No. 10121. 
 Section 17 of that law contains a listing of the competences that may	 be exercised during states of calamities: 



 SECTION 17. Remedial Measures. â The declaration of a state of 
calamity shall make mandatory the immediate undertaking of the following
 remedial measures by the member-agencies concerned as defined in this 
Act:








(a)


Imposition of price ceiling
 on basic necessities and prime commodities by the President upon the 
recommendation of the implementing agency as provided for under Republic
 Act No. 7581, otherwise known as the "Price Act", or the National Price
 Coordinating Council;






 


 






(b)


Monitoring, prevention and control by 
the Local Price Coordination Council of overpricing/profiteering and 
hoarding of prime commodities, medicines and petroleum products;






 


 






(c)


Programming/reprogramming of funds for the repair and safety upgrading of public infrastructures and facilities; and






 


 






(d)


 
Granting of no-interest loans by 
government financing or lending institutions to the most affected 
section of the population through their cooperatives or people's 
organizations. 










The law expands the power of the executive branch during emergencies.
 In passing Republic Act No. 10121, the legislature did not contemplate 
allowing the President to exercise any and all powers amounting to a 
suspension of existing legislation. Precisely, Republic Act No. 10121 is
 the legislation that limits that expansion of executive powers during 
that emergency. 


 The acknowledgement of the possible abuse of the executive's power 
to declare a state of calamity and to exercise powers not contemplated 
in the law is seen with two (2) salient features of the law. First, the 
declaration of a state of calamity may not be done without a 
recommendation. Section 16 provides: 



 SECTION 16. Declaration of State of Calamity. â The National 
Council shall recommend to the President of the Philippines the 
declaration of a cluster of barangays, municipalities, cities, 
provinces, and regions under a state of calamity, and the lifting 
thereof, based on the criteria set by the National Council. The 
President's declaration may warrant international humanitarian 
assistance as deemed necessary. 


 The declaration and lifting of the state of calamity may also be 
issued by the local sanggunian, upon the recommendation of the LDRRMC, 
based on the results of the damage assessment and needs analysis. 




 Second, the limited powers granted in Section 17 of Republic Act No.
 10121 is also implied in other provisions, which guard against the 
possibility for abuse. The law contains both active Congressional 
Oversight as well as a sunset provision: 



 SECTION 26. Congressional Oversight Committee. â There is hereby 
created a Congressional Oversight Committee to monitor and oversee the 
implementation of the provisions of this Act. The Committee shall be 
composed of six (6) members from the Senate and six (6) members from the
 House of Representatives with the Chairpersons of the Committees on 
National Defense and Security of both the Senate and the House of 
Representatives as joint Chairpersons of this Committee. The five (5) 
other members from each Chamber are to be designated by the Senate 
President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, respectively.
 The minority shall be entitled to pro rata representation but shall 
have at least two (2) representatives from each Chamber. 


 SECTION 27. Sunset Review. â Within five (5) years after the 
effectivity of this Act, or as the need arises, the Congressional 
Oversight Committee shall conduct a sunset review. For purposes of this 
Act, the term "sunset review" shall mean a systematic evaluation by the 
Congressional Oversight Committee of the accomplishments and impact of 
this Act, as well as the performance and organizational structure of its
 implementing agencies, for purposes of determining remedial 
legislation. 




 The provisions in statutes should not be read in isolation from the 
purpose of the legislation and in light of its other provisions. The 
grant of power given to the president when a state of calamity is 
declared should thus be read in a limited fashion. 
Expressio unius est exclusio alterius
. 
 Definitely, a total closure of an entire island is not contemplated in the law invoked by Proclamation No. 475. 
 
VIII

 More disturbingly, the Proclamation's violations of specific provisions
 contained in Republic Act No. 10121 patently shows that the latter 
cannot be the statutory basis for the exercise of executive power. 

 The period of the state of calamity provided in Proclamation No. 475 
contravenes Republic Act No. 10121. In the Proclamation, it is made 
dependent exclusively on the President. 
 Proclamation No. 475 provides: 



 The State of Calamity in the Island of Boracay shall remain in force and effect 
until lifted by the President
, notwithstanding the lapse of the six-month closure period. (Emphasis supplied) 




 However, in Republic Act No. 10121, the period is conditioned on several factors. Thus: 



 SECTION 16. Declaration of State of Calamity. â The National 
Council shall recommend to the President of the Philippines the 
declaration of a cluster of barangays, municipalities, cities, 
provinces, and regions under a state of calamity, and the lifting 
thereof, based on the criteria set by the National Council. The 
President's declaration may warrant international humanitarian 
assistance as deemed necessary. 


 
The declaration and lifting of the state of calamity may also 
be issued by the local sanggunian, upon the recommendation of the 
LDRRMC, based on the results of the damage assessment and needs 
analysis.
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Executive issuances cannot amend statutes under which they are 
issued. It is clear in Proclamation No. 475 that it only grants the 
President the power to lift the state of calamity. The power of the 
President to lift the state of calamity is not qualified in the 
Proclamation, and neither is there a standard. Likewise, it does not 
mention any other authority that can lift the state of calamity. 
Incidentally, there is also no standard for the six (6)-month closure of
 the island. 
 However, Republic Act No. 10121, under which the 
Proclamation claims authority, allows the Municipal Sanggunian, upon the
 recommendation of its Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management 
Council, to lift the state of calamity based on a "damage assessment and
 needs analysis."
[65]
 
 The Proclamation and the law are clearly contradictory. 
 
IX
 Moreover, the Proclamation transgresses both the Constitution's grant and the statutory elaboration of local autonomy. 

 The majority admits the intrusion of the President into the autonomy of
 the local government units, but finds it too trivial to warrant any 
consideration from this Court.
[66]
 
 I cannot agree. 

 Article X, Section 2 of the Constitution grants local autonomy to all 
territorial and political subdivisions. Section 4 of the same article 
provides that the president's power over local government units is 
merely of general supervision and excludes control: 



 ARTICLE X 


Local Government 


General Provisions


 SECTION 2. The territorial and political subdivisions shall enjoy local autonomy. 


. . . . 


 SECTION 4. The President of the Philippines shall exercise general
 supervision over local governments. Provinces with respect to component
 cities and municipalities, and cities and municipalities with respect 
to component barangays shall ensure that the acts of their component 
units are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions. 




 In issuing Proclamation No. 475, the President exercised control 
over the local government units. The Proclamation orders affected local 
government units to implement and execute the closure. This is 
definitely a measure of control, not mere supervision. 
 The distinction between supervision and control of local government units is settled in jurisprudence. 
 In 
Pimentel v. Aguirre
,
[67]

 this Court clarified the connection between supervision and control. 
The Constitution provides a president only with the power of supervision
 and not control over local government units. This power enables him or 
her to see to it that local government officials perform tasks within 
the bounds of law. He or she may not impair or infringe upon the power 
given to local government units by law. 
 This Court differentiated the powers of control and supervision in 
Drilon v. Lim
.
[68]

  The power of control is the power to lay rules in the performance of 
an act. This power includes the ability to order the act done and 
redone, while supervisory power only necessitates that rules are 
followed. Under the power of supervision, there is no discretion to 
alter the rules. In short, supervisory power entails that rules are 
observed and nothing more. 
 In 
Taule v. Santos
 
[69]
we
 ruled that the Chief Executive's power over local governments was 
merely that of checking whether the officials were performing their 
duties within the bounds of law.

 In 
Province of Batangas v. Romulo
,
[70]

 then President Joseph Ejercito Estrada (President Estrada) issued 
Executive Order No. 48 entitled, "Establishing a Program for Devolution 
Adjustment and Equalization." The program was established to facilitate 
the process of enhancing the capacities of local government units in the
 discharge of the functions and services devolved to them by the 
national government agencies concerned under the Local Government Code. 

 The Oversight Committee under Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora
 passed resolutions, which were approved by President Estrada on October
 6, 1999. The guidelines formulated by the Oversight Committee required 
local government units to identify the projects eligible for funding 
under the Local Government Service Equalization Fund, and submit them to
 the Department of Interior and Local Government for appraisal. Then, 
the Oversight Committee serves notice to the Department of Budget and 
Management for the subsequent release of the funds. 
 This Court 
struck down the resolutions as infringing on the fiscal autonomy of 
local government units as provided in the Constitution: 
 Article II 

  Declaration of Principles and State Policies



. . . .  


SECTION 25. 	The State shall ensure the autonomy of local governments. 




 An entire article of the Constitution has been devoted to 
guaranteeing and promoting the autonomy of local government units. 
Article X, Section 2 of the Constitution reiterates the State policy in 
this wise: 



 SECTION 2. The territorial and political subdivisions shall enjoy local autonomy. 




 Consistent with the principle of local autonomy, the Constitution 
confines the President's power over local government units to that of 
general supervision. This provision has been interpreted to exclude the 
power of control. The distinction between the two (2) powers was 
enunciated in 
Drilon v. Lim
:



  An officer in control lays down the rules in the doing of an act.
 If they are not followed, he may, in his discretion, order the act 
undone or re-done by his subordinate or he may even decide to do it 
himself. Supervision does not cover such authority. The supervisor or 
superintendent merely sees to it that the rules are followed, but he 
himself does not lay down such rules, nor does he have the discretion to
 modify or replace them. If the rules are not observed, he may order the
 work done or re-done but only to conform to the prescribed rules. He 
may not prescribe his own manner for doing the act. He has no judgment 
on this matter except to see to it that the rules are followed.
[71]




 The Local Government Code of 1991 was enacted to flesh out the 
mandate of the Constitution. The State policy on local autonomy is 
amplified in Section 2, thus:



 SECTION 2. 
Declaration of Policy
. â (a) It is hereby 
declared the policy of the State that the territorial and political 
subdivisions of the State shall enjoy genuine and meaningful local 
autonomy to enable them to attain their fullest development as 
self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the 
attainment of national goals. Toward this end, the State shall provide 
for a more responsive and accountable local government structure 
instituted through a system of decentralization whereby local government
 units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and 
resources. The process of decentralization shall proceed from the 
National Government to the local government units. 




 In 
National Liga ng mga Barangay v. Paredes
,
[72]

 the Department of Interior and Local Government was appointed as 
interim caretaker to administer and manage the affairs of the Liga ng 
mga Barangay in giving remedy to alleged violations made by its 
incumbent officer in the conduct of their elections. It issued 
memorandum circulars that alter, modify, nullify, or set aside the 
actions of the Liga ng mga Barangay.
 This Court ruled: 



 These acts of the DILG went beyond the sphere of general 
supervision and constituted direct interference with the political 
affairs, not only of the 
Liga, but more importantly, of the barangay 
as an institution. The election of Liga officers is part of the Liga's 
internal organization, for which the latter has already provided 
guidelines. In succession, the DILG assumed stewardship and jurisdiction
 over the Liga affairs, issued supplemental guidelines for the election,
 and nullified the effects of the Liga-conducted elections. Clearly, 
what the DILG wielded was the power of control which even the President 
does not have.
 


 Furthermore, the DILG assumed control when it appointed respondent Rayos as president of the 
Liga-Caloocan
 Chapter prior to the newly scheduled general Liga elections, although 
petitioner David's term had not yet expired. The DILG substituted its 
choice, who was Rayos, over the choice of majority of the punong 
barangay
 of Caloocan, who was the incumbent President, petitioner David. The latter was elected and had in fact been sitting as an 
ex-officio
 member of the sangguniang panlungsod in accordance with the 
Liga Constitution and By-Laws
. 
Yet,
 the DILG extended the appointment to respondent Rayos although it was 
aware that the position was the subject of a quo warranto
 proceeding
 instituted by Rayos himself, thereby preempting the outcome of that 
case. It was bad enough that the DILG assumed the power of control, it 
was worse when it made use of the power with evident bias and 
partiality. 


 As the entity exercising supervision over the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
, the DILG's authority over the 
Liga
 is limited to seeing to it that the rules are followed, but it cannot 
lay down such rules itself, nor does it have the discretion to modify or
 replace them. In this particular case, the most that the DILG could do 
was review the acts of the incumbent officers of the Liga in the conduct
 of the elections to determine if they committed any violation of the 
Liga's Constitution and By-laws and its implementing rules. If the 
National Liga Board and its officers had violated Liga rules, the DILG 
should have ordered the Liga to conduct another election in accordance 
with the Liga's own rules, but not in obeisance to DILGÂ­ dictated 
guidelines. Neither had the DILG the authority to remove the incumbent 
officers of the Liga and replace them, even temporarily, with unelected 
Liga officers
. 


 Like the local government units, the 
Liga ng mga Barangay
 is not subject to control by the Chief Executive or his 
alter ego
.
[73]




 Supervisory power has been defined as "the power of mere oversight 
over an inferior body; it does not include any restraining authority 
over such body."
[74]
 
 
The relationship between the President and local governments is a 
constitutional matter. Constitutional relationships are never trivial 
nor should it be trivialized. 
X
 
Significantly, the Proclamation is even contrary to the law that it 
alleges to implement. It totally misunderstands the statutory approach 
for disaster risk and reduction management. Section 2 of Republic Act 
No. 10121 provides:



 SECTION 2. Declaration of Policy. â It shall be the policy of the State to: 








(a)


Uphold the people's 
constitutional rights to life and property by addressing the root causes
 of vulnerabilities to disasters, strengthening the country's 
institutional capacity for disaster risk reduction and management and 
building the resilience of local communities to disasters including 
climate change impacts;






 


 






(b)


Adhere to and adopt the universal 
norms, principles, and standards of humanitarian assistance and the 
global effort on risk reduction as concrete expression of the country's

(c)


Incorporate internationally accepted 
principles of disaster risk management in the creation and 
implementation of national, regional and local sustainable development 
and poverty reduction strategies, policies, plans and budgets;






 


 






(d)


Adopt a disaster risk reduction and 
management approach that is holistic, comprehensive, integrated, and 
proactive in lessening the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of 
disasters including climate change, and promote the involvement and 
participation of all sectors and all stakeholders concerned, at all 
levels, especially the local community;






 


 






(e)


Develop, promote, and implement a 
comprehensive National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan 
(NDRRMP) that aims to strengthen the capacity of the national government
 and the local government units (LGUs), together with partner 
stakeholders, to build the disaster resilience of communities, and to 
institutionalize arrangements and measures for reducing disaster risks, 
including projected climate risks, and enhancing disaster preparedness 
and response capabilities at all levels;






 


 






(f)


Adopt and implement a coherent, 
comprehensive, integrated, efficient and responsive disaster risk 
reduction program incorporated in the development plan at various levels
 of government adhering to the principles of good governance such as 
transparency and accountability within the context of poverty 
alleviation and environmental protection;






 


 






(g)


Mainstream disaster risk reduction and 
climate change in development processes such as policy formulation, 
socioeconomic development planning, budgeting, and governance, 
particularly in the areas of environment, agriculture, water, energy, 
health, education, poverty reduction, land-use and urban planning, and 
public infrastructure and housing, among others;






 


 






(h)


Institutionalize the policies, 
structures, coordination mechanisms and programs with continuing budget 
appropriation on disaster risk reduction from national down to local 
levels towards building a disaster-resilient nation and communities;






 


 






(i)


Mainstream disaster risk reduction into
 the peace process and conflict resolution approaches in order to 
minimize loss of lives and damage to property, and ensure that 
communities in conflict zones can immediately go back to their normal 
lives during periods of intermittent conflicts;






 


 






(j)


Ensure that disaster risk reduction and
 climate change measures are gender responsive, sensitive to indigenous 
knowledge systems, and respectful of human rights;






 


 






(k)


 
Recognize the local risk patterns 
across the country and strengthen the capacity of LGUs for disaster risk
 reduction and management through decentralized powers, 
responsibilities, and resources at the regional and local levels;






 


 






(l)


Recognize and strengthen the capacities
 of LGUs and communities in mitigating and preparing for, responding to,
 and recovering from the impact of disaster's;






 


 






(m)


 
Engage the participation of civil 
society organizations (CSOs), the private sector and volunteers in the 
government's disaster risk reduction programs towards complementation of
 resources and effective delivery of services to the citizenry;






 


 






(n)


Develop and strengthen the capacities 
of vulnerable and marginalized groups to mitigate, prepare for, respond 
to, and recover from the effects of disasters;






 


 






(o)


 
Enhance and implement a program where 
humanitarian aid workers, communities, health professionals, government 
aid agencies, donors, and the media are educated and trained on how they
 can actively support breastfeeding before and during a disaster and/or 
an emergency; and














(p)


Provide maximum care, assistance and 
services to individuals and families affected by disaster, implement 
emergency rehabilitation projects to lessen the impact of disaster, and 
facilitate resumption of normal social and economic activities. 










 The President cannot take over what has been statutorily granted to 
local governments units. To allow him to do so would be to violate his 
oath of office under Article VII, Section 5 of the Constitution.
[75]
 


 Republic Act No. 10121 itself creates a whole structure to address 
preparation and management of the kinds of disasters envisioned in that 
law. Thus: 



 SECTION 6. Powers and Functions of the NDRRMC. â The National 
Council, being empowered with policy-making, coordination, integration, 
supervision, monitoring and evaluation functions, shall have the 
following responsibilities:

be reviewed on a five (5)-year interval, or as may be deemed necessary, 
in order to ensure its relevance to the times;






 


 






(b)

Monitor and provide the necessary 
guidelines and procedures on the Local Disaster Risk Reduction and 
Management Fund (LDRRMF) releases as well as utilization, accounting and
 auditing thereof; 






 


 






(j)

 to vulnerable areas and ecosystems in coordination with the Climate 
Change Commission;






 


 






(k)


Develop vertical and horizontal 
coordination mechanisms for a more coherent implementation of disaster 
risk reduction and management policies and programs by sectoral agencies
 and LGUs; 






 


 






(l)

capability building program for disaster risk reduction and management 
to address the specific weaknesses of various government agencies and 
LGUs, based on the results of a biennial baseline assessment and

(m)


Formulate, hannonize, and translate 
into policies a national agenda for research and technology development 
on disaster risk reduction and management;






 


 






(n)


In coordination with the Climate Change
 Commission, formulate and implement a framework for climate change 
adaptation and disaster risk reduction and management from which all 
policies, programs, and projects shall be based;






 


 






(o)


Constitute a technical management group
 composed of representatives of the abovementioned departments, offices,
 and organizations, that shall coordinate and meet as often as necessary
 to effectively manage and sustain national efforts on disaster risk 
reduction and management;






 


 






(p)


Task the OCD to conduct periodic 
assessment and performance monitoring of the member-agencies of the 
NDRRMC, and the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils

SECTION 7. Authority of the NDRRMC Chairperson. â The Chairperson 
of the NDRRMC may call upon other instrumentalities or entities of the 
government and nongovernment and civic organizations for assistance in 
terms of the use of their facilities and resources for the protection 
and preservation of life and properties in the whole range of disaster 
risk reduction and management. This authority includes the power to call
 on the reserve force as defined in Republic Act No. 7077 to assist in 
relief and rescue during disasters or calamities. 


 SECTION 8. The Office of Civil Defense. â The Office of Civil 
Defense (OCD) shall have the primary mission of administering a 
comprehensive national civil defense and disaster risk reduction and 
management 	program 	by 	providing 	leadership 	in 	the 	continuous 
development of strategic and systematic approaches as well as measures 
to reduce	the	vulnerabilities	and	risks to	hazards and	manage the 
consequences of disasters. 


 The Administrator of the OCD shall also serve as Executive 
Director of the National Council and, as such, shall have the same 
duties and privileges of a department undersecretary. All appointees 
shall be universally acknowledged experts in the field of disaster 
preparedness and management and of proven honesty and integrity. The 
National Council shall utilize the services and facilities of the OCD as
 the secretariat of the National Council.

and marginalized groups in the barangay.










The Proclamation, even as it claims to be based on this law, inexplicably undermines this structure. 


	 The law tasks the local government units to lead in meeting disasters. Thus, in Section 2 of Republic Act No. 10121: 









(l)


Recognize and strengthen 
the capacities of LGUs and communities in mitigating and preparing for,

society organizations (CSOs), the private sector and volunteers in the 
government's disaster risk reduction programs towards complementation of
 resources and effective delivery of services to the citizenry; 






 


 






(n)


Develop and strengthen the capacities 
of vulnerable and marginalized groups to mitigate, prepare for, respond 
to, and recover from the effects of disasters; 








Furthermore, in Section 15:




 SECTION 15. Coordination During Emergencies. â 
The LDRRMCs 
shall take the lead in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from
 the effects of any disaster based on the following criteria
: 








(a)


The BDC, if a barangay is affected;














(b)


The city/municipal DRRMCs, if two (2) or more barangays are affected;














(c)


The provincial DRRMC, if two (2) or more cities/municipalities are affected;














(d)


The regional DRRMC, if two (2) or more provinces are affected; an














(e)


The NDRRMC, if two (2) or more regions are affected. 








The NDRRMC and intermediary LDRRMCs 
shall always act
 as support to LGUs which have the primary responsibility as first disaster responders. 
Private
 sector and civil society groups shall work in accordance with the 
coordination mechanism and policies set by the NDRRMC and concerned 
LDRRMCs. (Emphasis supplied) 




 Even if we assume that the Proclamation was a valid exercise of 
police power, only the Municipality of Malay, Aldan has been directly 
affected by the calamity. This means that, statutorily, the 
Municipality's Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council 
should take charge. Yet, the Proclamation reduces the local government 
unit into a minor player in the rehabilitation of the island. 
 Being contrary to the very law it alleges to be its framework, Proclamation No. 475 is not a valid exercise of police power. 
 
XI


 The situation in Boracay is not the only ecological disaster 
that we face as a nation. The majority creates a dangerous precedent. 

 For instance, climate change is an urgent and serious calamity faced by
 the entire world. Our climate is changing faster now than at any point 
in history.
[76]
 We have been 
experiencing a tremendous increase in carbon dioxide in the air, melting
 icecaps, a consequent rise in sea levels, frigid cold, and extreme 
heat. Scientists have attributed this to human activity. The rapid rise 
in our temperatures only started in 1880, during the second industrial 
revolution, and most of the warming occurred in the last 35 years. 

 Scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are urging 
the world to keep global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius 
(1.5 Â°C) for the next 12 years. We are currently one degree Celsius (1 
Â°C) warmer than preindustrial levels. This change is the reason for the 
hurricanes in the United States, drought in Cape Town, and forest fires 
in the Arctic. Half a degree more than the 1.5 Â°C target will worsen 
droughts, floods, and extreme weather conditions. Coral reefs may 
disappear completely. Polar ice caps will melt, causing our sea levels 
to rise.
[77]
 Heat waves will 
be more intense. Cold spells will be a lot worse; consequently, plant, 
insect, and animal species will disappear, and human lives will suffer.
[78]
 Countries such as ours without financial and other resources at our disposal will suffer more.
 We need to address this situation perhaps more urgently than the fecal coliform formation in our tourist areas. 

 Yet, these urgent anthropogenic crises cannot be solved by indulging 
our impatience. Rather, solutions will require both better governance 
and democratic participation. 
 Instead of relying on the 
beguiling pragmatism of a strongman, we should, now more than ever, have
 the humility to harness our abilities as humans to consult, deliberate,
 and act together. We should be aware that short-term solutions, which 
produce short-term effects, may mask the true problems and abuse those 
who live in our society's margins. 

 The growth of fecal coliform may be arrested with a drastic and 
draconian clean-up. Clearly, without addressing its true causes, the 
ecological remedy will be temporary. The costs may be too high if such 
temporary relief is purchased with the suspension of the rights of those
 affectedâespecially the informal and marginal workers on the 
islandâwith a legal precedent that does not take the long view. That is 
why our environmental laws are permanent statutes, and states of 
calamity are only temporary and declared under very limiting conditions.
 
 Many of our tourist areas may have become what economists call 
as open access areas. These areas are subject to what Garett Hardin, an 
American ecologist and philosopher, more than four (4) decades ago 
called the "tragedy of the commons."
[79]

 In this situation, businesses, residents, and tourists cannot see 
beyond the short-term enjoyment of the resource while well aware of the 
degradation that others will cause. The solution to such a tragedy is a 
more accountable enforcement of the rules for the enjoyment of the 
environment and the evolution of a stronger community. To assure the 
existence of a true common property regime, everyone involved must do 
what is expected of them. 
 The legitimation of the closure of 
Boracay through the Proclamation at issue here easily opens the slippery
 slope for ecological authoritarianism. 
 Boracay, originally home
 to the Ati, was discovered as a pristine island. It attracted migrants,
 allowed them to establish abodes, and claim ownership. Then, a catena 
of administrations promoted it as a tourist attraction, compelling its 
residents to adjust their lives accordingly. Businesses flourished 
without an understanding of Boracay's ecology's carrying capacity. 

 Worse, unscrupulous individuals created profits purchased through 
illicit collusion with those who should have regulated where they built,
 how they built, how they dealt with their sewage, where they would get 
their water. Boracay was destroyed by the shortsightedness of some of 
the public officials in charge and the unbelievable ignorance of the 
establishments that profited from what should have been the 
sustainability of their ecology. 
 Boracay is victim to the 
callousness driven by short-term profits and insatiable greed. It is 
increasingly vulnerable because of the growing absence of a genuine 
community on the island.
 This Court should assure those who are 
affected that it will offer a genuine reflection of the constitutional 
order, under which it seeks to find pragmatic yet longer lasting 
solutions to our problems. This Court is the forum where we can assure 
an ordinary sandcastle builder, a driver, or an informal worker on the 
island that we all can be an active part of the solution, as envisioned 
by our democracy.
 I regret that the liberality of the majority in
 not seeing the constitutional and statutory violations of the 
Proclamation, and the actions it spawned, will undermine this 
constitutional order. 
 Authoritarian solutions based on fear are 
ironically weak. We still are a constitutional order that will become 
stronger with a democracy participated in by enlightened citizens. Ours 
is not, and should never be, a legal order ruled by diktat. 
For these reasons, I dissent.
 
ACCORDINGLY
, I vote to GRANT the Petition.

CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION
 


JARDELEZA, 
J
.: 


The following are the basic facts of the case:


 On April 26, 2018, President Rodrigo R. Duterte issued 
Proclamation No. 475 declaring a state of calamity in the Island of 
Boracay in Malay, Aklan, and ordered the closure of the island as a 
tourist destination for six months, or until October 25, 2018. 
Petitioners Mark Anthony Zabal (Zabal), Thiting Estoso Jacosalem 
(Jacosalem), and Odon S. Bandiola (Bandiola) filed this special civil 
action for prohibition and 
mandamus
 (with application for temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or 
status quo ante

 order) seeking to, among others, enjoin the implementation of 
Proclamation No. 475 and compel public respondents to allow the entry of
 both tourists and residents into Boracay Island.
  
 Before going into the substance of the issues raised in the 
petition, I note that petitioners sought direct recourse with this Court
 on the ground, among others, that "[t]here are no factual issues raised
 in this case, only questions of law x x x."
[1]

 Indeed, this Court exercises original jurisdiction over petitions for 
prohibition and mandamus concurrently with the Court of Appeals (CA) and
 the Regional Trial Courts (RTCs).
[2]

 The doctrine of hierarchy of courts, however, dictates that such 
actions first be filed before the trial courts. Save for the specific 
instance provided under the Constitution,
[3]
 this Court is not a trier of facts.
[4]

 Its original jurisdiction cannot be invoked to resolve issues which are
 inextricably connected with underlying questions of fact.
 
 
This Court is a court of last resort, and must so remain if it is to 
satisfactorily perform the functions assigned to it by the Constitution.
[5]

 Direct recourse to this Court may, as petitioners correctly suggest, be
 allowed only to resolve questions which do not require the prior 
adjudication of factual issues. It is thus on this basis that I will 
examine and resolve the present petition.


 Petitioners challenge the legality of Proclamation No. 475
[6]

 insofar as it ordered the closure of Boracay Island on the following 
grounds: (1) it is an invalid exercise by the President of legislative 
power; (2) it violates the right to travel insofar as it seeks to 
restrict the entry of tourists and non-residents into the island; (3) it
 operates to deprive persons working in the island of their means of 
livelihood without due process of law; and (4) it violates the principle
 of local autonomy insofar as affected local government units are 
ordered to implement the closure.
[7]

 My examination of the issues raised and arguments offered by 
petitioners shows that, of the four principal issues raised against the 
constitutionality of Proclamation No. 475, only the first issue poses a 
question the complete resolution of which does not involve underlying 
questions of fact. On the other hand, and as I shall later demonstrate, 
the three remaining issues involve underlying questions of fact which 
cannot be resolved by this Court at the first instance.
 I
  
 Petitioners claim that Proclamation No. 475 is an invalid exercise by the President of legislative power.
[8]

 According to petitioners, access to Boracay can be validly restricted 
(as part of the right to travel) only through the exercise of police 
power, that is, by law. They maintain that no such law exists; thus, the
 President, by restricting and altogether prohibiting entry to Boracay 
Island, has arrogated unto himself legislative powers rightfully 
belonging to the Congress.
[9]

 The primary legal question therefore is whether there is a law which 
allows for a restriction on the right to travel to Boracay. If the Court
 finds that there is none, then this litigation should end with the 
grant of the petition. If, however, the Court finds that such a law 
exists, it must then determine whether there was a valid delegation to 
the President of the power to restrict travel.
 I find that the President has the authority, under Republic Act No. (RA) 10121,
[10]
 to issue the challenged Proclamation as an exercise of his power of subordinate legislation.


First
, the text of the Proclamation clearly counts RA 10121 among its 
legal bases for the temporary closure of Boracay Island. I quote: 
  


 
WHEREAS, 
pursuant to RA No. 10121
, or the 
Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010, the 
National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council has recommended 
the declaration of a State of Calamity in the Island of Boracay and the temporary closure of the Island as a tourist destination

 to ensure public safety and public health, and to assist the government
 in its expeditious rehabilitation, as well as in addressing the 
evolving socio-economic needs of affected communities;




 x x x x
[11]


 
Second
, RA 10121 allows for a restriction on the right to travel 
under certain circumstances.


 The expressed legislative intention in RA 10121 was "for the development of policies and plans and 
the implementation of actions and measures pertaining to all aspects of disaster risk reduction and management
."
[12]
 Disaster risk reduction and management was, in turn, defined under Section 3(o) as follows: 
  


 (o) "Disaster Risk Reduction and Management" - 
the systematic
 process of using administrative directives, organizations, and 
operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and 
improved coping capacities in order 
to lessen the adverse impacts of hazards and the possibility of disaster
.
 Prospective disaster risk reduction and management refers to risk 
reduction and management activities that address and seek to avoid the 
development of new or increased disaster risks, especially if risk 
reduction policies are not put in place.
[13]
 




 Disaster risk reduction and management measures can run the gamut 
from disaster prevention to disaster mitigation, disaster preparedness, 
and disaster response, all of which are also defined under RA 10121 as 
follows: 
  


 Sec. 3. 
Definition of Terms.
 - For purposes of this Act, the following shall refer to:


 x x x x


 (h) "Disaster" - a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society 
involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts
,
 which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope 
using its own resources. Disasters are often described as a result of 
the combination of: the exposure to a hazard; the conditions of 
vulnerability that are present: and insufficient capacity or measures to
 reduce or cope with the potential negative consequences. Disaster 
impacts may include loss of life, injury, disease and other negative 
effects on human, physical, mental and social well-being, together with 
damage to property, destruction of assets, loss of services, social and 
economic disruption and 
environmental degradation
. 


 (i) "Disaster Mitigation" - the lessening or limitation of the 
adverse impacts of hazards and related disasters. Mitigation measures 
encompass engineering techniques and hazard-resistant construction as 
well as improved environmental policies and public awareness. 


 (j) "Disaster Preparedness" - the knowledge and capacities 
developed by governments, professional response and recovery 
organizations, communities and individuals to 
effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions
.
 Preparedness action is carried out within the context of disaster risk 
reduction and management and aims to build the capacities needed to 
efficiently manage all types of emergencies and achieve orderly 
transitions from response to sustained recovery. 
Preparedness is
 based on a sound analysis of disaster risk and good linkages with early
 warning systems, and includes such activities as contingency planning, 
stockpiling of equipment and supplies, the development of arrangements 
for coordination, 
evacuation 
and public information, and associated training and field exercises.
 These must be supported by formal institutional, legal and budgetary capacities. 


 (k) "Disaster Prevention" - the outright avoidance of adverse 
impacts of hazards and related disasters. It expresses the concept and 
intention to completely avoid potential adverse impacts through 
action taken in advance
 such as construction of dams or embankments that eliminate flood risks,
 land-use regulations that do not permit any settlement in high-risk zones
, and seismic engineering designs that ensure the survival and function of a critical building in any likely earthquake. 


 (l) "Disaster Response" - the provision of emergency services 
and public assistance during or immediately after a disaster in order to
 save lives, 
reduce health impacts, ensure public safety

 and meet the basic subsistence needs of the people affected. Disaster 
response is predominantly focused on immediate and short-term needs and 
is sometimes called "disaster relief."




 x x x x
[14]


 Thus, within the range of disaster risk reduction and management measures can be found 
forced or preemptive evacuation and prohibitions against settlement in high-risk zones
, both of which necessarily implicate some restriction on a person's liberty of movement to ensure public safety. 
 
Third
, in obvious recognition of its inability to "cope directly with the myriad problems"
[15]

 attending the matter, the Congress created administrative agencies, 
such as the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council 
(NDRRMC) and the Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils 
(LDRRMCs), to help implement the legislative policy of disaster risk 
reduction and management under RA 10121. 
 Under the law, the NDRRMC, for example, was tasked to, among others, 
develop

 a national disaster risk reduction and management framework (NDRRMF), 
which shall serve as "the principal guide to disaster risk reduction and
 management efforts in the country,"
[16]
 
advise
 the President on the status of disaster preparedness, 
recommend
 the declaration (and lifting) by the President of a state of calamity in certain areas, and 
submit proposals
 to restore normalcy in affected areas.
[17]

 Under Section 25, it was also expressly tasked to come up with "the 
necessary rules and regulations for the effective implementation of 
[the] Act." 
  
 These, to me, are evidence of a general grant of 
quasi-legislative power, or the power of subordinate legislation, in 
favor of the implementing agencies. With this power, administrative 
bodies may implement the broad policies laid down in a statute by 
"filling in" the details which the Congress may not have the opportunity
 or competence to provide.
[18]
 In 
A
bakada Guro Party List v. Purisima
,
[19]
 this Court explained: 
  


 Congress has two options when enacting legislation to define 
national policy within the broad horizons of its legislative competence.
 It can itself formulate the details or it can assign to the executive 
branch the responsibility for making necessary managerial decisions in 
conformity with those standards. In the latter case, the law must be 
complete in all its essential terms and conditions when it leaves the 
hands of the legislature. Thus, what is left for the executive branch or
 the concerned administrative agency when it formulates rules and 
regulations implementing the law is to fill up details (supplementary 
rule-making) or ascertain facts necessary to bring the law into actual 
operation (contingent rule-making).
[20]
 (Citations omitted.) 




 This results in 
delegated legislation
[21]

 which, to be valid, should not only be germane to the objects and 
purposes of the law; it must also conform to (and not contradict) the 
standards prescribed by the law.
[22]
 

 Pursuant to the broad authority given to them, the NDRRMC and the 
President, following standards provided under the law, thus sought to 
fill in the details on how the provisions of RA 10121 may be enforced, 
including, but not limited to, identification of: the conditions that 
must exist before a state of calamity can be declared; the effects of a 
declaration of a state of calamity;
[23]

 the length of time the state of calamity will be enforced; the 
formulation and implementation of evacuation plans, including the 
guidelines on when, where, how, and who will be evacuated; the agency 
who will implement the evacuation plan; and other details. 
 
Fourth,
 Proclamation No. 475 is a valid exercise of the power of subordinate legislation.
 Here, after consideration of the conditions existing in the Island of Boracay,
[24]
 the President, upon recommendation of the NDRRMC, decided to place the island under a State of Calamity.
[25]
 This is a power expressly lodged in the President under Section 16, which reads:
  


 Sec. 16. 
Declaration of State of Calamity
. - The National
 Council shall recommend to the President of the Philippines the 
declaration of a cluster of barangays, municipalities, cities, 
provinces, and regions under a state of calamity, and the lifting 
thereof, based on the criteria set by the National Council. The 
President's declaration may warrant international humanitarian 
assistance as deemed necessary. 


 The declaration and lifting of the state of calamity may also be
 issued by the local sanggunian, upon the recommendation of the LDRRMC, 
based on the results of the damage assessment and needs analysis. 




 As set forth in Proclamation No. 475 itself, the conditions in the
 island were such that it became "necessary to implement urgent measures
 to address x x x human-induced hazards, to protect and promote the 
health and well-being of its residents, workers and tourists, and to 
rehabilitate the Island in order to ensure the sustainability of the 
area and prevent further degradation of its rich ecosystem."
[26]

 I thus find that the avowed purpose of the Proclamation, which is "to 
ensure public safety and public health, and to assist the government in 
its expeditious rehabilitation," is unarguably germane to the object and
 purpose of RA 10121, which is disaster risk reduction and management.
 In 
The Conference of Maritime Manning Agencies, Inc. v. Philippine Overseas Employment Administration
,
[27]

 this Court, speaking through former Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr., 
noted that the following have been held sufficient standards for 
purposes of subordinate legislation: "public welfare," "necessary in the
 interest of law and order," "public interest," "justice and equity," 
"public convenience and welfare," "justice and equity and substantial 
merits of the case," "simplicity, economy and efficiency," and "national
 interest."
[28]
 I find that 
the challenged action of the President conforms with the standards under
 RA 10121, which include public safety, public health, and disaster 
mitigation, among others.
 
Fifth
, in carrying RA 10121 into effect, the implementing agencies have consistently interpreted their power to "evacuate"
[29]
 to necessarily include the power to restrict entry into a particular place.
[30]
 This is evident in the 	alarm measures and systems of a number of government instrumentalities. 

 In the case of impending or actual volcanic eruptions, the Philippine 
Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) has established alert
 levels in its monitoring of active volcanoes in the country. Each level
 has its own set of criteria and recommended course of action to be 
taken, including prohibiting entry into and expanding the danger zones.
[31]
 Likewise, depending on the declared alert level, the NDRRMC, through its local counterparts, enforces forced evacuations and 
prohibits entry and farming in localities found within the danger zones
.
[32]
 

 In cases of tropical cyclones or typhoons, the Philippine Atmospheric, 
Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) uses 
public storm warning signals to describe the existing meteorological 
condition and impact of the winds. Each signal also indicates the 
precautionary measures which must be undertaken and what the affected 
areas must do. For public storm warning signals 3 and 4, evacuation and 
cancellation of all travel and outdoor activities are advised.
[33]
 

 Similarly, to mitigate the effects of flooding during heavy rains, 
Marikina City employs a three-stage alarm level system for the Marikina 
River, based on the depth of water in the river below the Sto. NiÃ±o 
Bridge: 
  
 	Alarm Level 1 (1 minute continuous airing), when the water is 15 meters above sea level, means "prepare."
 Alarm Level 2 (2 minutes intermittent airing), when the water is 16 meters above sea level, means "
evacuate
." 
 Alarm Level 3 (5 minute continuous airing), when the water is 18 meters above sea level, means "
forced evacuation
."
[34]
 


 When the river's water level rises, the local Disaster Risk 
Reduction and Management office uses a siren to alert surrounding 
communities of the current alarm level.
[35]
 

 This contemporaneous construction by the NDRRMC, the different LDRRMCs,
 and local government units, as well as the other agencies tasked to 
implement the provisions of RA 10121, of their powers ordinarily 
controls the construction of the courts: 
  


 The rationale for this rule relates not only to the emergence of
 the multifarious needs of a modern or modernizing society and the 
establishment of diverse administrative agencies for addressing and 
satisfying those needs; it also relates to the accumulation of 
experience and growth of specialized capabilities by the administrative 
agency charged with implementing a particular statute. In 
Asturias Sugar Central, Inc. v. Commissioner of Customs
,
 the Court stressed that executive officials are presumed to have 
familiarized themselves with all the considerations pertinent to the 
meaning and purpose of the law, and to have formed an independent, 
conscientious and competent expert opinion thereon. The courts give much
 weight to the government agency or officials charged with the 
implementation of the law, their competence, expertness, experience and 
informed judgment, and the fact that they frequently are drafters of the
 law they interpret.
[36]
 




 
Sixth
, administrative regulations and policies enacted by 
administrative bodies to interpret the law which they are entrusted to 
enforce have the force of law and enjoy a presumption of regularity. 
 In 
EspaÃ±ol v. Chairman, Philippine Veterans Administration
,
[37]

 this Court held that the Philippine Veterans Administration's (PVA) 
policyâwhich withheld the payment of pension to beneficiaries of 
veterans who are already receiving pension from United States (U.S.) 
Veterans Administrationâhas in its favor a presumption of validity. 
Thus, the Court ruled that it was only when this administrative policy 
was declared invalid can petitioner be said to have a cause of action to
 compel the PVA to pay her monthly pension.
[38]
 
 In 
Rizal Empire Insurance Group v. NLRC
,
[39]

 petitioner's appeal was dismissed for failure to follow the "no 
extension policy" set forth under the Rules of the National Labor 
Relations Commission. According to the Court, it is an elementary rule 
in administrative law that administrative regulations and policies, 
enacted by administrative bodies to interpret the law which they are 
entrusted to enforce, have the force of law and are entitled to great 
respect.
[40]
 More recently, in the case of 
Alfonso v. Land Bank of the Philippines
,
[41]

 this Court held that the formulas for the computation of just 
compensation, being an administrative regulation issued by the 
Department of Agrarian Reform pursuant to its rule-making and 
subordinate legislation power, have the force and effect of law. "Unless
 declared invalid in a case  where its validity is directly put in 
issue, courts must consider their use and application.â
[42]

 Even in the U.S., the government agency's own reading of a statute 
which it is charged with administering is given deference. In
 Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc
.,
[43]

  the U.S. Supreme Court employed a two-step test in determining what 
standard of review should be applied in assessing the government 
agency's interpretation and gave deference to the latter's 
interpretation:
  


 When a court reviews an agency's construction of the statute 
which it administers, it is confronted with two questions. First, 
always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the 
precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is 
the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give 
effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. If, however, 
the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise 
question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction
 on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an 
administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or 
ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court
 is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction 
of the statute.
[44]




 
Finally
, since the law's enactment in 2010, there has been 
no attempt on the part of Congress to correct or reverse the consistent 
contemporaneous construction of the law by the different agencies 
implementing RA 10121. This is especially noteworthy considering the 
existence of a Congressional Oversight Committee, composed of members 
from both its Houses, which was created precisely to "monitor and 
oversee the implementation of [RA 10121]"
[45]
 and evaluate, among others, the performance of the law's implementing agencies.
[46]

 That this Committee has not taken steps to correct, revise, or repeal 
the agencies' contemporaneous construction of RA 10121's provisions 
further buttresses the view that the construction given by the different
 administrative agencies conforms to the standards and the 
interpretation intended by the Legislature. 
 In sum, I find that 
the President has the authority, under RA 10121, to issue the challenged
 Proclamation as a valid exercise of his power of subordinate 
legislation. With this, I vote to DISMISS the petition. The Court should
 decline to resolve the remaining questions raised in the petition as, 
and which I shall hereafter discuss, they unavoidably involve questions 
of fact which this Court cannot entertain and resolve. 
 II
  
 Petitioners' next two remaining arguments revolve around 
Proclamation No. 475's alleged violation of their fundamental rights to 
travel and due process of law. While petitioners claim that these 
arguments pose questions of law, I find that they actually raise and 
involve underlying questions of fact. 
A
  
 Indeed, the rights to travel and due process of law are rights
 explicitly guaranteed under the Bill of Rights. These rights, while 
fundamental, are not absolute. 
 Section 6, Article III of the 
Constitution itself provides for three instances when the right to 
travel may be validly impaired: 
  


 Sec. 6. The liberty of abode and of changing the same within the
 limits prescribed by law shall not be impaired except upon lawful order
 of the court. 
Neither shall the right to travel be impaired 
except in the interest of national security, public safety, or public health, as may be provided by law
.
[47]




 Even prior to the Constitution, this Court, in the 1919 case of 
Rubi v. Provincial Board of Mindoro
,
[48]

 has held that there is no absolute freedom of locomotion. The right of 
the individual is necessarily subject to reasonable restraint for the 
common good, in the interest of the public health or public order and 
safety. 
In Leave Division, Office of Administrative Services-Office of the 
Court Administrator (OCA) v. Heusdens
,
[49]

 which involved an administrative case against a court employee for 
failure to secure authority to travel abroad in violation of OCA 
Circular No. 49-2003, the Court took occasion to identify the various 
constitutional, statutory, and inherent limitations regulating the right
 to travel. 
  
 This was reiterated in 
Genuino v. De Lima
,
[50]

 where this Court invalidated Department of Justice Circular No. 
41âwhich purported to restrict the right to travel through the issuance 
of hold departure and watchlist ordersâfor lack of legal basis.
[51]
 
 In the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of 
Zemel v. Rusk
,
[52]

 identified circumstances which may justify the restriction on the right
 to travel: (1) areas ravaged by flood, fire, or pestilence can be 
quarantined when it can be demonstrated that unlimited travel to the 
area would directly and materially interfere with the safety and welfare
 of the area or the Nation as a whole; and (2) weightiest considerations
 of national security. Likewise, the case of 
Alexander v. City of Gretna
[53]

 emphasized that compelling safety and welfare reasons, the preservation
 of order and safety, and health concerns can serve to justify an 
intrusion on the fundamental right to interstate travel. In 
State v. Wright
[54]
 and later, in 
Sim v. State Parks & Recreation
,
[55]

 the Washington Supreme Court upheld the State Parks & Recreation 
Commission's authority, at reasonable times, at reasonable places, and 
for reasonable reasons, consistent with public safety and recreational 
activities, to temporarily close ocean beach highways to motor vehicular
 traffic. 
 Similarly, the right of a person to his labor is 
deemed to be property within the meaning of constitutional guarantees, 
that is, he cannot be deprived of his means of livelihood, a property 
right, without due process of law.
[56]

 Nevertheless, this property right, not unlike the right to travel, is 
not absolute. It may be restrained or burdened, through the exercise of 
police power, to secure the general comfort, health, and prosperity of 
the State.
[57]
 To justify such
 interference, two requisites must concur: (a) the interests of the 
public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, 
require the interference of the State; and (b) the means employed are 
reasonably necessary to the attainment of the object sought to be 
accomplished and not unduly oppressive upon individuals. In other words,
 the proper exercise of the police power requires the concurrence of a 
lawful subject and a lawful method.
[58]
 B
  
 Having established that the rights to travel and due process 
are not absolute, as they can in fact be validly subject to restrictions
 under certain specified circumstances, it seems to me that petitioners'
 issues against Proclamation No. 475 respecting their rights to travel 
and due process hinge not so much on whether said Proclamation imposes a
 restriction, but whether the restrictions it imposed are 
reasonable
.
[59]
 Specifically, petitioners argue that: the ordered closure of Boracay Island is an extreme measure;
[60]

 it is overly broad, oppressive, unreasonable, and arbitrary; and that 
there are more less restrictive and more narrowly drawn measures which 
the government can employ to protect the State's interest.
[61]
 

 What is "reasonable," however, is not subject to exact definition or 
scientific formulation. There is no all-embracing test of 
reasonableness;
[62]
 its determination rests upon human judgment as 
applied to the facts and circumstances
 of each particular case.
[63]
 In this case, the following 
factual
 circumstances were considered, which led to the issuance of Proclamation No. 475: 
  
 High concentration of fecal coliform due to insufficient sewer 
lines and illegal discharge of untreated waste water into the beach, 
with daily tests revealing consistent failure in compliance with 
acceptable water standards, with an average result of 18,000 most 
probable number (MPN)/100 ml, exceeding the standard level of 400 
MPN/100 ml;
 Failure of most commercial establishments and residences to connect to the sewerage infrastructure of Boracay Island; 
 Improper waste disposal, in violation of environmental laws, rules, and regulations; 
 Majority (14 out of 51) of the establishments near the shore are not compliant with the Philippine Clean Water Act of 2004; 
 Degradation of the coral reefs and coral cover of Boracay 
Island as a consequence of continued exposure to dirty water caused by 
increased tourist arrivals;
 Solid waste within Boracay Island is at a generation rate of 90
 to 115 tons per day, while the hauling capacity of the local government
 is only 30 tons per day;
 The natural habitats of Puka shells, nesting grounds of marine 
turtles, and roosting grounds of flying foxes or fruit bats have been 
damaged and/or destroyed; 
Only four out of nine wetlands in Boracay Island remain due to illegal encroachment of structures; 
Beach erosion is prevalent in Boracay Island due to storms, 
extraction of sand along the beach to construct properties and 
structures along the foreshore, and discharge of waste water near the 
shore, causing degradation of coral reefs and seagrass meadows;
 Direct discharge of waste water near the shore has resulted in frequent algal bloom and coral deterioration; and 
 The continuous rise of tourist arrivals, the insufficient sewer
 and waste management system, and environmental violations of 
establishments aggravate the environmental degradation and destroy the 
ecological balance of the Island of Boracay, resulting in major damage 
to property and natural resources, as well as the disruption of the 
normal way of life of the people therein. 


 After due consideration of the above, the President, upon the 
NDRRMC's recommendation, declared a State of Calamity in the Island of 
Boracay and ordered its closure as a tourist destination for a period of
 six months. Petitioners take issue with the reasonableness of the 
measures taken and seek to take the President and the implementing 
agencies to task on this account. Arriving at a conclusion regarding the
 propriety and reasonableness of the above measures, however, will 
necessarily require examining the 
factual
 circumstances which formed the premise for Proclamation No. 475's issuance.
 Permit me to illustrate, using some of Proclamation No. 475's factual considerations. 
 
On the high concentration of fecal coliform in the water
:
 To prove unreasonableness, petitioners may present evidence to prove 
that closure, if at all, for a shorter period of time (less than six 
months) is needed for the water coliform level to return to acceptable 
standards. Evidence may also be presented to show that closure of the 
island as a tourist destination is not even necessary to address the 
insufficiency of sewer lines and illegal discharge of untreated waste 
water into the beach. 
 
On the non-connection of the commercial establishments and residences to the island's sewerage infrastructure
:
 To prove unreasonableness, petitioners may present evidence to show 
that closure of the island is not even necessary to connect all 
establishments to the existing sewerage infrastructure. Even assuming 
that
 some
 closure is necessary, petitioners may present evidence to show that connection may be done on a 
one-barangay-at-a-time
 basis (instead of simultaneously closing off all three barangays), and for a period shorter than six months. 
 
On the establishments' non-compliance with the Philippine Clean Water Act
:
 To prove unreasonableness, petitioners may present evidence that the 
simple issuance of notices of violation would be sufficient to compel 
establishments to comply with the requirements of the Act. 
 
On the degradation of the coral reefs and coral cover in the island because of dirty water
:
 To prove unreasonableness, petitioners may present evidence to show 
that the local government is unable to meet the waste generation rate in
 the island; that there is no rational relation between the 
environmental issues (such as the destruction of the natural habitats of
 the various animals, existence of illegal encroachments, beach erosion,
 and other conditions existing in the island) and the purported closure 
of the island to tourists for six months. 
 The foregoing, 
however, involve questions of fact which cannot be entertained by this 
Court. Questions of fact indispensable to the disposition of a case, as 
in this case, are cognizable by the trial courts; petitioners should 
thus have filed the petition before them. Failure to do so, in fact, is 
sufficient to warrant the Court's dismissal of the case.
[64]
 

 For similar reasons, I find that the Court should also decline to 
resolve the fourth issue raised by petitioners, that is, whether 
Proclamation No. 475 violates the principle of local autonomy insofar as
 it orders local government units to implement the closure. Similar with
 the 
ponencia's
 finding, I find that, contrary to petitioners' 
arguments, the text of RA 10121 actually recognizes and even empowers 
the local government unit in disaster risk reduction and management.
[65]
 I also hasten to add that whether or not Proclamation No. 475 did, in fact, cause an 
actual 
intrusion
 into an affected local government unit's powers is still largely a 
question of fact. In fact, even assuming that petitioners are able to 
show such intrusion, again it seems to me that their issue against such 
would involve a question into the reasonableness of the same under the 
circumstances. This issue, as already shown, 
still 
involves the 
resolution of underlying issues of fact. For example, petitioners would 
have to present evidence to show, among others, that the local 
government unit concerned had recommended a 
less drastic
 course 
of action to address the situation than those taken under the 
Proclamation, and that this recommendation was not considered and/or 
actually overruled by the President and/or NDRRMC. 
 Petitioners cite 
White Light Corporation v. City of Manila
,
[66]
 
Lucena Grand Central Terminal, Inc. v. JAC Liner, Inc.
,
[67]
 and 
Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Viron Transportation, Co, Inc
.
[68]

  to demonstrate how this Court has stricken down measures which have 
been shown to be unreasonable and/or not the least restrictive means to 
pursue a particular government interest. To my mind, however, none of 
the foregoing cases are useful to further petitioners' cause. Rather 
than justify direct resort pursuant to this Court's original 
jurisdiction over certain cases, the foregoing cases all the more 
highlight the necessity of following the hierarchy of courts. 
 In 
White Light Corporation
,
 the validity of Manila City Ordinance No. 7774, entitled "An Ordinance 
Prohibiting Short-Time Admission, Short-Time Admission Rates, and 
Wash-Up Rate Schemes in Hotels, Motels, Inns, Lodging Houses, Pension 
Houses, and Similar Establishments in the City of Manila," was 
challenged on the ground that it violated sacred constitutional rights 
to liberty, due process, and equal protection of law. 
 In 
Lucena Grand Central Terminal, Inc
.,
 the constitutionality of City Ordinance Nos. 1631 and 1778âwhich 
granted a franchise to petitioner and regulated entrance into the city, 
respectivelyâwas challenged on the ground that they constituted an 
invalid exercise of police power, an undue taking of private property, 
and a violation of the constitutional prohibition against monopolies. 
 In 
Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA)
,
 petitioners therein questioned the MMDA's authority to order the 
closure of provincial bus terminals along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue 
and major thoroughfares of Metro Manila. 
 It appears to escape 
petitioners' notice that while the above cases did involve 
constitutional challenges, none involved a direct recourse to this 
Court. The challenges were initially filed before the RTC, who had the 
first opportunity to evaluate and resolve the same, 
after 
the 
parties were able to thresh out the factual issues, enter into 
stipulations, or agree on the conduct of proceedings. By so doing, by 
the time the cases reached this Court, only questions of law remained to
 be settled.
[69]
 This, to my 
mind, results in a more judicious use of the Court's limited time and 
resources. A strict observance of the rule on hierarchy of courts would 
save the Court from having to resolve factual questions (which, in the 
first place, it is ill-equipped to do, much less in the first instance) 
and enable it to focus on the more fundamental tasks assigned to it 
under the Constitution. 
 C
  
 It is beyond dispute that the rights to travel and to due process of law are fundamental.
[70]

 This is significant because, traditionally, liberty interests are 
protected only against arbitrary government interference, that is, a 
claim to a liberty interest may fail upon a showing by the government of
 a rational basis to believe that its interference advances a legitimate
 legislative objective.
[71]
 Where, however, a liberty interest has been accorded an "elevated" fundamental right status, the government is subject to a
 higher 
burden
 of proof to justify intrusions into these interests, namely, the 
requirements of strict scrutiny in equal protection cases
[72]
 and that of compelling state interest in due process cases.
[73]
 
 In his Concurring Opinion in 
Estrada v. Sandiganbayan
,
[74]
 Justice Vicente Mendoza wrote: 
  


 Petitioner cites the dictum in 
Ople v. Torres 
that "when 
the integrity of a fundamental right is at stake, this Court will give 
the challenged law, administrative order, rule or regulation stricter 
scrutiny" and that "It will not do for authorities to invoke the 
presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties." As 
will presently be shown, "strict scrutiny," as used in that decision, is
 not the same thing as the "strict scrutiny" urged by petitioner. 
Much
 less did this Court rule that because of the need to give "stricter 
scrutiny" to laws abridging fundamental freedoms, it will not give such 
laws the presumption of validity
.
[75]




 Similarly, mere invocation of a fundamental right, or an alleged 
restriction thereof, would not operate to excuse a pleader from proving 
his case. Lest petitioners forget, Proclamation No. 475, issued by the 
President pursuant to his power of subordinate legislation under RA 
10121, enjoys the presumption of constitutionality and legality. To 
overcome this,  facts establishing 
invalidity
 must be proven through the presentation of evidence. In 
Ermita-Malate Hotel and Motel Operators Association, Inc. v. City Mayor of Manila
,
[76]
 citing 
O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co
.,
[77]
 this Court stressed:
  


 It admits of no doubt therefore that there being a presumption of validity 
the necessity for evidence to rebut it is unavoidable
,
 unless the statute or ordinance is void on its [face,] which is not the
 case here. The principle has been nowhere better expressed than in the 
leading case of 
O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co
., where the American Supreme Court through Justice Brandeis tersely and succinctly summed up the matter thus: 




 The statute here questioned deals with a subject clearly 
within the scope of the police power. We are asked to declare it void on
 the ground that the [specific] method of regulation prescribed is 
unreasonable and hence deprives the plaintiff of due process of law. As 
underlying questions of fact may condition the constitutionality of 
legislation of this character, the presumption of constitutionality must
 prevail in the absence of some factual foundation of record for 
overthrowing the statute. 


 
No such factual foundation being laid in the present case, 
the lower court deciding the matter on the pleadings and the stipulation
 of [facts], the presumption of validity must prevail and the judgment 
against the ordinance set aside.
[78]






 Thus, and until it is set aside with finality in an appropriate case by a competent court,
[79]

 Proclamation No. 475 has the force and effect of law and must be 
enforced accordingly. The burden of proving its unconstitutionality 
rests on the party assailing the governmental regulations and 
administrative issuances.
[80]

 More importantly, the doctrine of hierarchy of courts requires that 
factual questions first be submitted to trial courts who are more 
properly equipped to receive evidence on, and ultimately resolve, issues
 of fact. Where, as in this case, the resolution of the issue on 
constitutionality requires the determination and evaluation of extant 
factual circumstances, this Court should decline to exercise its 
original jurisdiction and, instead, reserve judgment until such time 
that the question is properly brought before it on appeal.
 For all the foregoing reasons, I vote to 
DISMISS
 the petition.

 of income has been held sufficient to confer petitioners therein with 
legal standing to challenge the contracts of Philippine International

the closure of Boracay Island, they are also in imminent danger of 
losing their sources of income, as sandcastle maker and tourist driver,

Similarly, and consistent with this Court's ruling in

 has legal standing to raise the issue affecting the right to travel 
insofar as he has alleged that he is a non-resident who will no longer 
be allowed entry to Boracay Island beginning April 26, 2018.

remedial measures the effects and consequences of declaring an area in a
 state of calamity.

DISSENTING OPINION
 


CAGUIOA, 
J
.:






 


"As one great furnace flamed, yet from those flames 
No light, but rather darkness visible."
[1]






 


 On April 26, 2018, President Rodrigo R. Duterte issued Proclamation No. 475
[2]

 (Proclamation 475), declaring a state of calamity in the island of 
Boracay and ordering its temporary closure for a maximum of six months.

 Petitioners Mark Anthony Zabal (Zabal) and Thiting Estoso Jacosalem 
(Jacosalem), residents and workers in Boracay, filed the present 
Petition to assail the temporary closure of the island. They are joined 
herein by petitioner Odon Bandiola (Bandiola), a regular visitor of 
Boracay for business and pleasure. 
 Together, petitioners claim 
that Proclamation 475 is unconstitutional as it constitutes an invalid 
exercise of legislative power which places undue restrictions on their 
constitutional rights to travel and due process. 
 The 	
ponencia

	denies the Petition, and 	affirms the 	validity	of Proclamation 475, 
viewing it as an executive measure which does not pose an actual 
impairment on the right to travel and due process.
[3]
 Moreover, the 
ponencia

 is of the view that even if Proclamation 475 were to be construed as 
restrictive of these fundamental rights, its issuance remains justified 
as a reasonable exercise of police power occasioned by the pressing 
state of Boracay island.
[4]


 The judicial confirmation of Proclamation 475's purported 
validity comes after Boracay's re-opening. The temporary closure has 
come to an end; its decreed rehabilitation now complete. It appears that
 the proverbial ship has now sailed, as "paradise" appears to have been 
restored. Its restoration, however, has been forged at great expense â 
the indiscriminate impairment of fundamental rights. 
 I cannot, 
in conscience, give my imprimatur to yet another constitutional 
shortcut. In a democratic state governed by the rule of law, fundamental
 rights cannot be traded in exchange for the promise of paradise. 
Without question, under the rule of law, the end does not, and can never
 ever, justify the means. 
 I register my dissent not because I 
refuse to acknowledge the serious problems that Boracay has faced. On 
the contrary, I recognize that there was a problem; a disaster that, in 
fact, needed action. The necessity for action did not, however, justify 
the measures which the Executive chose to take. 
  
 Our country's form of government â democratic, republican, and
 presidential â characterized by separation, coordination, and the 
interdependence of its branches, has long been criticized for having 
burdensome processes that slow down program execution, particularly, in 
the realm of disaster response. However, as long as this form of 
government is in place, and so long as our Constitution subscribes to 
the ideals of separation of powers, no shortcuts of any kind may or 
should be allowed. I find Proclamation 475 unconstitutional. It finds 
absolutely no basis in law, and unduly permits the consequent impairment
 of the rights to travel and due process by executive fiat. 
  
 Thus, I am impelled to dissent upon the insistence that the 
Constitution must be, at all times, respected. As the bedrock of our 
civil society, the Constitution deserves no less. 
 
The constitutional right to travel

 The right to travel is a chief element of the constitutional guarantee 
of liberty which was first introduced by the Congress of the United 
States to the Philippines during the early days of the American regime.
[5]
 
 In 
Samahan ng mga Progresibong Kabataan (SPARK) v. Quezon City
[6]
 (
Spark
), the Court held that the right to travel refers to "the right to move freely from the Philippines to other countries or 
within
 the Philippines" and covers, among others, "the power of locomotion".
[7]
  In the simplest of terms, it is the freedom to move where one chooses to go. 
 As a fundamental constitutional right, the protection afforded by the right to travel inures to 
every
 citizen. The provision granting such right is self-executing; its 
exercise
 is not contingent upon further legislation governing its enforcement.
[8]
 
 The same does not hold true, however, with respect to the right's impairment. 
  




Section 6, Article III of the Constitution is clear â the right to travel may only be restricted by law
 






The impairment of the right to travel, while permissible, is subject to the 
strict requirements
 set forth under Section 6, Article III of the Constitution, thus: 
  


 Section 6. The liberty of abode and of changing the same within 
the limits prescribed by law shall not be impaired except upon lawful 
order of the court. 
Neither shall the right to travel be impaired 
except in the interest of national security, public safety, or public 
health, as may be provided by law.
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 The import of the provision is crystal clear â the right to travel may 
only
 be impaired in the interest of national security, public safety or public health, 
on the basis of a law 
explicitly
 providing for the impairment
. 
 Expounding on these parameters, the Court, in 
Genuino v. De Lima
[9]
 (
Genuino
), unequivocally held: 
  


 Clearly, under the provision, there are only three 
considerations that may permit a restriction on the right to travel: 
national security, public safety or public health. 
As a further 
requirement, there must be an explicit provision of statutory law or the
 Rules of Court providing for the impairment. The requirement for a 
legislative enactment was purposely added to prevent inordinate 
restraints on the person's right to travel by administrative officials 
who may be tempted to wield authority under the guise of national 
security, public safety or public health
. This is in keeping 
with the principle that ours is a government of laws and not of men and 
also with the canon that provisions of law limiting the enjoyment of 
liberty should be construed against the government and in favor of the 
individual. 


 The necessity of a law before a curtailment in the freedom of 
movement may be permitted is apparent in the deliberations of the 
members of the Constitutional Commission. In particular, Fr. Joaquin 
Bernas, in his sponsorship speech, stated thus: 




 On Section 5, in the explanation on page 6 of the annotated 
provisions, it says that the phrase "and changing the same" is taken 
from the 1935 version; that is, changing the abode. The addition of the 
phrase WITHIN THE LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY LAW ensures that, whether the 
rights be impaired on order of a court or without the order of a court, 
the impairment must be in accordance with the prescriptions of law; that
 is, it is not left to the discretion of any public officer.
[10]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 






 The requirement of a law authorizing the curtailment of the right 
to travel is, to repeat, crystal clear â any restriction imposed upon 
such right in the absence of the law, whether through a statute enacted 
through the legislative process, or provided in the Constitution itself,
[11]
 necessarily renders the restriction null and void. 
  




Proclamation 475 poses an actual restriction on the right to travel






The dismissal of the Petition is primarily grounded on the premise 
that any effect which Proclamation 475 may have on the right to travel 
is "merely corollary to the closure of Boracay," and as such, a 
necessary incident of the island's rehabilitation.
[12]

 This premise gives rise to the conclusion that Proclamation 475 need 
not comply with the requirements set forth under Section 6, Article III,
 as its effect on the right to travel is only indirect and merely 
incidental. 
  
 I disagree. 
 The requirements under the Constitution are spelled out in clear and absolute terms â 
neither
 shall the right to travel be impaired except in the interest of 
national security, public safety, or public health, as may be provided 
by law.
 The provision does not distinguish between measures that 
directly
 restrict the right to travel and those which do so 
indirectly
, in the furtherance of another State purpose. 
Ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemus.

 This interpretation is grounded on the text of the Constitution and 
finds basis in case law both here and in the United States. 
 In 
Shapiro v. Thomspon
[13]
 (
Shapiro
),
 the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) was confronted with a 
constitutional challenge against certain statutory provisions enacted in
 Connecticut, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia (D.C). The 
assailed provisions denied welfare assistance to applicants who have not
 resided in the cities' respective jurisdictions for at least a year 
immediately preceding the filing of their applications. These 
provisions, according to the appellants therein, had been crafted as "a 
protective device to preserve the fiscal integrity of state public 
assistance programs."
[14]
 

 Resolving the case, SCOTUS ruled that the assailed provisions violate 
the constitutional guarantee of interstate movement, among others, 
insofar as they create classifications which effectively penalize the 
exercise of the right to travel,
[15]
 thus: 
  


 We do not doubt that the one-year waiting period device is well 
suited to discourage the influx of poor families in need of assistance. 
An indigent who desires to migrate, resettle, find a new job, and start a
 new life will doubtless hesitate if he knows that he must risk making 
the move without the possibility of falling back on state welfare 
assistance during his first year of residence, when his need may be most
 acute. But the purpose of inhibiting migration by needy persons into 
the State is constitutionally impermissible. 


 This Court long ago recognized that the nature of our Federal 
Union and our constitutional concepts of personal liberty unite to 
require that all citizens be free to travel throughout the length and 
breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which
 unreasonably burden or restrict this movement. x x x


 x x x x


 Thus, the purpose of deterring the in-migration of indigents 
cannot serve as justification for the classification created by the 
one-year waiting period, since that purpose is constitutionally 
impermissible. If a law has "no other purpose . . . than to chill the 
assertion of constitutional rights by penalizing those who choose to 
exercise them, then it [is] patently unconstitutional."
[16]
 (Citations omitted) 




  Following 
Shapiro
, SCOTUS handed down its decision in 
Attorney General of New York v. Soto-Lopez
[17]
 (
Soto-Lopez
),
 holding that "[a] state law implicates the right to travel when it 
actually deters such travel, x x x [whether] impeding travel is its 
primary objective, x x x or when it uses '
any classification which serves to penalize the exercise of that right
."'
[18]
 
Soto-Lopez

 involved a challenge against the employment preference afforded by the 
New York Constitution and Civil Service Law to New York 
resident-veterans honorably discharged from the Armed Forces.
[19]
 
 More recently, in 
State of Ohio v. Burnett
[20]
 (
Burnett
),
 the Supreme Court of Ohio was confronted with an action questioning the
 validity of a Cincinnati ordinance which established "drug-exclusion 
zones" within the city for the purpose of controlling drug-related 
activity in the area. These zones were identified as those where the 
number of drug-related arrests were significantly higher than other 
similarly situated and sized areas of the city. The establishment of 
these zones had the incidental effect of prohibiting persons from 
entering the zones within a specified "exclusion period" upon the threat
 of arrest for criminal trespass. Thus, the Cincinnati ordinance was 
questioned for being violative of the right to travel, among others. 
 
While
 conceding that the Cincinatti ordinance had been grounded on a 
compelling state interest, the Ohio Supreme Court nevertheless ruled 
that it had the incidental effect of "unconstitutionally burdening" the 
right to travel
.
[21]
 Hence, the Supreme Court of Ohio held: 
  


 Cincinnati asserts that the purposes of Chapter 755 are 
"restoring the quality of life and protecting the health, safety, and 
welfare of citizens using the public ways" in drug-exclusion zones and 
"allowing the public to use and enjoy the facilities in such areas 
without interference arising from illegal drug abuse and/or illegal drug
 abuse related crimes." We agree with the city that these asserted 
interests are compelling. The destruction of some neighborhoods by 
illegal drug activity has created a crisis of national magnitude, and 
governments are justified in attacking the problem aggressively. 
When
 legislation addressing the drug problem infringes certain fundamental 
rights, however, more than a compelling interest is needed to survive 
constitutional scrutiny. The statute must also be narrowly tailored to 
meet the compelling interest. It is our opinion that while Chapter 755 
is justified by a compelling interest, it fails constitutional analysis 
because the ordinance is not narrowly tailored to restrict only those 
interests associated with illegal drug activity, but also restricts a 
substantial amount of innocent conduct.

 Though these cases are not binding in this jurisdiction, the Court
 has regarded American case law as a rich source of persuasive 
jurisprudence
[22]
 that may guide the bench. 
 That said, the Court need not look beyond its own jurisprudence to find the answers that it seeks. 
 In the recent case of 
Spark
,
 the Court characterized curfew ordinances as restrictive of minors' 
right to travel, albeit imposed primarily for the interest of public 
safety, particularly the promotion of juvenile safety and prevention of 
juvenile crime.
[23]
 To stress anew, the Court therein referred to the right to travel as "the right to 
move freely
 from the Philippines to other countries or 
within the Philippines
," and a "right embraced within the 
general concept of liberty
â which, in turn, includes "the 
power of locomotion
 and the right of citizens to be 
free to use their faculties in lawful ways and to live and work where they desire or where they can best pursue the ends of life
."
[24]
 

 The afore-cited cases tell us that measures which impede the right to 
travel in furtherance of other state interests, whether impermissible 
(as in 
Shapiro
) or even permissible (as in 
Burnett
 and 
Spark
), are treated in the same manner as those which
 directly
 restrict the right. 

 The foregoing cases, taken together with the text of the Constitution, 
unequivocally negate the assertion that Proclamation 475 does not cause a
 substantive impairment on the right to travel so as to exempt it from 
the requirements set forth in Section 6, Article III. 
 In this 
regard, I disagree with the contention that the effect of the closure of
 Boracay on a person's ability to travel is merely incidental in nature;
 hence, conceptually remote from the right's proper sense. To my mind, 
that an assailed government act only 
indirectly
 or
 incidentally 
affects
 a constitutional right is inconsequential as any impairment of 
constitutionally-protected rights must strictly comply with the mandate 
of the Constitution. As held in 
Genuino
: 
  


 The DOJ would however insist that the resulting infringement of 
liberty is merely incidental, together with the consequent 
inconvenience, hardship or loss to the person being subjected to the 
restriction and that the ultimate objective is to preserve the 
investigative powers of the DOJ and public order. It posits that the 
issuance ensures the presence within the country of the respondents 
during the preliminary investigation. 
Be that as it may, no objective
 will ever suffice to legitimize desecration of a fundamental right. To 
relegate the intrusion as negligible in view of the supposed gains is to
 undermine the inviolable nature of the protection that the Constitution
 affords.
[25]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 As well, Proclamation 475 cannot be likened to government 
regulations that amount to the "cordoning-off" of areas ravaged by 
calamities, where access by people thereto may be prohibited pursuant to
 public safety considerations. This is because local government units 
are already explicitly authorized under the Local Government Code to 
close down roads for such purpose, to wit: 
  


 Section 21. 
Closure and Opening of Roads
. â (a) 
A 
local government unit may, pursuant to an ordinance, permanently or 
temporarily close or open any local road, alley, park, or square falling
 within its jurisdiction
: 
Provided, however
, That in case of permanent closure, such ordinance must be approved by at least two-thirds (2/3) of all the members of the 
sanggunian
, and when necessary, an adequate substitute for the public facility that is subject to closure is provided. 


 x x x x 


 (c) 
Any national or local road, alley, park, or square may be temporarily closed during an actual emergency
,
 or fiesta celebrations, public rallies, agricultural or industrial 
fairs, or an undertaking of public works and highways, 
telecommunications, and waterworks projects, 
the duration of which shall be specified by the local chief executive concerned in a written order
: x x x (Emphasis supplied) 




 Thus, I submit that the present case cannot be likened to a 
"cordoning-offâ situation, considering that the latter actually complies
 with Section 6, Article III, 
i.e
., that the restriction be 
grounded on either national security, public safety or public health, 
and that the restriction be provided by law. Accordingly, I maintain my 
position that the resolution of this case hinges on the right to travel.
 
  




There is no law which grants the 
President any form of police power so as to authorize the impairment of 
the right to travel during a state of calamity






The 
ponencia
 alternatively holds that the issuance of 
Proclamation 475 is valid as a police power measure. It cites Republic 
Act No. (RA) 10121 and RA 9275 as statutory bases for the validity of 
the proclamation. 
  
 The 
ponencia
, as well as respondents, rely on the 
provisions of RA 10121 which empower the National Disaster Risk 
Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) to recommend to the President 
the declaration of state of calamity. In particular, they cite the 
following provisions: 
  


 SEC. 6. 
Powers and Functions of the NDRRMC.
 â The 
National Council, being empowered with policy-making, coordination, 
integration, supervision, monitoring and evaluation functions, shall 
have the following responsibilities: 


 x x x x


 (c) Advise the President on the status of disaster preparedness,
 prevention, mitigation, response and rehabilitation operations being 
undertaken by the government, CSOs, private sector, and volunteers; 
recommend to the President the declaration of a state of calamity in 
areas extensively damaged; and submit proposals to restore normalcy in 
the affected areas, to include calamity fund allocation; 


 x x x


 SEC. 16. 
Declaration of Stale of Calamity.
 â The National
 Council shall recommend to the President of the Philippines the 
declaration of a cluster of barangays, municipalities, cities, 
provinces, and regions under a state of calamity, and the lifting 
thereof, based on the criteria set by the National Council. x x x




 From the foregoing provisions, the 
ponencia
 argues that 
"the statutes from which [Proclamation 475] draws authority and the 
constitutional provisions which serve as its framework are primarily 
concerned with the environment and health, safety, and well-being of the
 people, the promotion and securing of which are clearly legitimate 
objectives of governmental efforts and regulations."
[26]
 The
 ponencia
 then concludes that Proclamation 475 is a valid police power measure. 
 I differ. 
 
First
, the afore-cited provisions of RA 10121 only empower the NDRRMC to 
recommend

 to the President the declaration of a "state of calamity" and submit to
 him "proposals to restore normalcy in the affected areas." In turn, the
 actions or programs to be undertaken by the President during a state of
 calamity, to be valid, 
must 
still
 be within the powers granted to him under the Constitution and other laws. 

 To be sure, there is absolutely nothing in RA 10121 from which it could
 reasonably be inferred that the law empowers the NDRRMC or the 
President to close an entire island. 
In fact, RA 10121 does not even refer to the President
, except in connection with the declaration of a state of calamity in Section 16, quoted above. 

 Parenthetically, it should be emphasized that, under RA 10121, a "state
 of calamity" only authorizes the President to impose the following 
remedial measures: 
  


 (a) Imposition of price ceiling on basic necessities and prime 
commodities by the President upon the recommendation of the implementing
 agency as provided for under Republic Act No. 7581, otherwise known as 
the "Price Act", or the National Price Coordinating Council; 


 (b) Monitoring, prevention and control by the Local Price 
Coordination Council of overpricing/profiteering and hoarding of prime 
commodities, medicines and petroleum products; 


 (c) Programming/reprogramming of funds for the repair and safety upgrading of public infrastructures and facilities; and


 (d) Granting of no-interest loans by government financing or 
lending institutions to the most affected section of the population 
through their cooperatives or people's organizations.
[27]




 The very narrow scope of the President's powers during a state of 
calamity as declared in accordance with RA 10121 becomes more apparent 
when placed in contrast with those granted by the statute in favor of 
the NDRRMC. 
 The powers and prerogatives of the NDRRMC are detailed under RA 10121 as follows: 
  


 SEC. 6. 
Powers and Functions of the NDRRMC.
 â The 
National Council, being empowered with policy-making, coordination, 
integration, supervision, monitoring and evaluation functions, shall 
have the following responsibilities: 


 (a) Develop a NDRRMF which shall provide for a comprehensive, 
all-hazards, multi-sectoral, inter-agency and community-based approach 
to disaster risk reduction and management. The Framework shall serve as 
the principal guide to disaster risk reduction and management efforts in
 the country and shall be reviewed on a five (5)-year interval, or as 
may be deemed necessary, in order to ensure its relevance to the times; 


 (b) Ensure that the NDRRMP is consistent with the NDRRMF;


 (c) Advise the President on the status of disaster preparedness,
 prevention, mitigation, response and rehabilitation operations being 
undertaken by the government, CSOs, private sector, and volunteers; 
recommend to the President the declaration of a state of calamity in 
areas extensively damaged; and submit proposals to restore normalcy in 
the affected areas, to include calamity fund allocation;


 (d) Ensure a multi-stakeholder participation in the development,
 updating, and sharing of a Disaster Risk Reduction and Management 
Information System and Geographic Information System-based national risk
 map as policy, planning and decision-making tools; 


(e) Establish a national early warning and emergency alert system
 to provide accurate and timely advice to national or local emergency 
response organizations and to the general public through diverse mass 
media to include digital and analog broadcast, cable, satellite 
television and radio, wireless communications, and landline 
communications;


 (f) Develop appropriate risk transfer mechanisms that shall 
guarantee social and economic protection and increase resiliency in the 
face of disaster;


 (g) Monitor the development and enforcement by agencies and 
organizations of the various laws, guidelines, codes or technical 
standards required by this Act; 


(h) Manage and mobilize resources for disaster risk reduction and
 management including the National Disaster Risk Reduction and 
Management Fund;


 (i) Monitor and provide the necessary guidelines and procedures 
on the Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (LDRRMF) 
releases as well as utilization, accounting and auditing thereof; 


(j) Develop assessment tools on the existing and potential 
hazards and risks brought about by climate change to vulnerable areas 
and ecosystems in coordination with the Climate Change Commission; 


(k) Develop vertical and horizontal coordination mechanisms for a
 more coherent implementation of disaster risk reduction and management 
policies and programs by sectoral agencies and LGUs; 


(l) Formulate a national institutional capability building 
program for disaster risk reduction and management to address the 
specific weaknesses of various government agencies and LGUs, based on 
the results of a biennial baseline assessment and studies;


 (m) Formulate, harmonize, and translate into policies a national
 agenda for research and technology development on disaster risk 
reduction and management;


 (n) In coordination with the Climate Change Commission, 
formulate and implement a framework for climate change adaptation and 
disaster risk reduction and management from which all policies, 
programs, and projects shall be based; 


(o) Constitute a technical management group composed of 
representatives of the abovementioned departments, offices, and 
organizations, that shall coordinate and meet as often as necessary to 
effectively manage and sustain national efforts on disaster risk 
reduction and management;


 (p) Task the OCD to conduct periodic assessment and performance 
monitoring of the member-agencies of the NDRRMC, and the Regional 
Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils (RDRRMCs), as defined in
 the NDRRMP; and


 (q) Coordinate or oversee the implementation of the country's 
obligations with disaster management treaties to which it is a party and
 see to it that the country's disaster management treaty obligations be 
incorporated in its disaster risk reduction and management frameworks, 
policies, plans, programs and projects. 


 x x x x


 Section 15. 
Coordination During Emergencies
. â The 
LDRRMCs shall take the lead in preparing for, responding to, and 
recovering from the effects of any disaster based on the following 
criteria: 




 (a) The BDC, if a barangay is affected; 


 (b) The city/municipal DRRMCs, if two (2) or more barangays are affected; 


 (c) The provincial DRRMC, if two (2) or more cities/municipalities are affected; 


 (d) The regional DRRMC, if two (2) or more provinces are affected; and


 (e) The NDRRMC, if two (2) or more regions are affected. 






 RA 10121 likewise established Local Disaster Risk Reduction and 
Management Councils/Offices (LDRRMCs/LDRRMOs) in every province, city, 
and municipality in the country, which are "responsible for setting the 
direction, development, implementation and coordination of disaster risk
 management programs within their [respective] territorial 
jurisdiction[s]."
[28]
 
Specifically, LDRRMOs are empowered to, among others, (i) identify, 
assess, and manage the hazards, vulnerabilities and risks that may occur
 in their locality;
[29]
 (ii) identify and implement cost-effective risk reduction measures/strategies;
[30]
 and (iii) respond to and manage the adverse effects of emergencies and carry out recovery activities in the affected area.
[31]


 Notably, majority of those who compose the LDRRMCs are officials of 
local government unit
s
[32]
 (LGUs) 
over whom the President only exercises 
supervision, instead of control
.
[33]

 Restated, it is very clear that the intent of the law â in directing 
the LDRRMCs to "take the lead", and in declaring that the NDRRMC would 
only take over "if two (2) or more regions are affected" â is to favor 
local autonomy in disaster preparedness and disaster response. 
  
 
From the foregoing, there can be no serious doubt that the sixÂ­-month closure of Boracay, as ordered by Proclamation 475, 
cannot
 be anchored on RA 10121. To conclude as such requires an Olympic leap in logic which is totally unwarranted
,
 considering that RA 10121: (i) gave preference to local actors, not 
national ones, as regards disaster response and (ii) only granted the 
President authority to implement limited remedial measures following a 
declaration of a "state of calamity".
 The case of 
Review Center Association of the Philippines v. Executive Secretary Ermita
[34]

 is on point. Therein, the President issued an executive order 
authorizing the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) to supervise 
review centers and similar establishments. The petitioner therein sought
 to declare the executive order unconstitutional on the ground that CHED
 had no supervisorial authority over them and that the executive order 
constitutes a usurpation of legislative power by the President. Ruling in
 favor of the petitioner, the Court held: 
  


 The scopes of EO 566 and the RIRR clearly expand the CHED's 
coverage under RA 7722. The CHED's coverage under RA 7722 is limited to 
public and private institutions of higher education and degreeÂ­granting 
programs in all public and private post-secondary educational 
institutions. EO 566 directed the CHED to formulate a framework for the 
regulation of review centers and similar entities. 


 The definition of a review center under EO 566 shows that it 
refers to one which offers "a program or course of study that is 
intended to refresh and enhance the knowledge or competencies and skills
 of reviewees obtained in the formal school setting in preparation for 
the licensure examinations" given by the PRC. It also covers the 
operation or conduct of review classes or courses provided by 
individuals whether for a fee or not in preparation for the licensure 
examinations given by the PRC. 


 x x x x


 
The President has no inherent or delegated legislative 
power to amend the functions of the CHED under RA 7722. Legislative 
power is the authority to make laws and to alter or repeal them, and 
this power is vested with the Congress
 under Section 1, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution which states: 




 Section 1. The legislative power shall be vested in the 
Congress of the Philippines which shall consist of a Senate and a House 
of Representatives, except to the extent reserved to the people by the 
provision on initiative and referendum. 


 x x x






 Police power to prescribe regulations to promote the health, 
morals, education, good order or safety, and the general welfare of the 
people flows from the recognition that 
salus populi est suprema lex
 â the welfare of the people is the supreme law. 
Police
 power primarily rests with the legislature although it may be exercised
 by the President and administrative boards by virtue of a valid 
delegation. Here, no delegation of police power exists under RA 7722 
authorizing the President to regulate the operations of non-degree 
granting review centers.
[35]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; emphasis in the original omitted) 
  
 
Second
, police power is an inherent attribute of 
sovereignty which has been defined as the power to "make, ordain, and 
establish all manner of wholesome and reasonable laws, statutes and 
ordinances, either with penalties or without, not repugnant to the 
Constitution, as they shall judge to be for the good and welfare of the 
commonwealth, and for the subjects of the same."
[36]
 Our Constitutional design, however, lodges police power primarily on the Legislature.
 That police power is lodged primarily in the Legislature does not appear to be in dispute. This is apparent from the 
ponencia

 itself, which defines police power as the "state authority to enact 
legislation that may interfere with personal liberty or property in 
order to promote the general welfare."
[37]
 

 Clearly, police power cannot be exercised by any group or body of 
individuals not possessing legislative power; its exercise, therefore, 
is contingent upon a valid delegation.
[38]
 

 In fact, a look at the powers at the President's disposal in times of 
calamity leads to the inevitable conclusion that Proclamation
 475 does 
not
 find basis in
 any
 law
. 

 Under the Constitution, the President, on whom Executive power is 
vested by Section 1, Article VII of the Constitution, may, in times of 
calamity, exercise: 
  


 (1) 
calling out powers
, an ordinary police action
[39]
 to call on the armed forces to prevent or suppress three specific instances - lawless violence, invasion, or rebellion;
[40]


 (2)
 emergency powers
, which, even then, may only be exercised in times of war or after Congress considers the calamity as a "national emergency" 
and passes a law
 authorizing the President to exercise "powers necessary and proper to carry out a declared national policy";
[41]
 and


 (3) 
taking over powers
, which include taking over of, or 
directing the operation of any privately-owned public utility or 
business affected with public interest;
[42]

 and the power to establish and operate vital industries in the interest
 of national welfare or defense, and the power to transfer to public 
ownership utilities and other private enterprises to be operated by the 
Government upon payment of just compensation.
[43]
 




 Under RA 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, the President may also exercise general supervision over LGUs,
[44]

 and augment the basic services and facilities assigned to an LGU when 
the need arises, that is, when such services or facilities are not made 
available or, if made available, are inadequate to meet the requirements
 of its inhabitants.
[45]
 

 Further, in cases of epidemics, pestilence, and other widespread public
 health dangers, the Secretary of Health may, upon the direction of the 
President and in consultation with the LGU concerned, temporarily assume
 direct supervision and control over health operations in any LGU for 
the duration of the emergency, but in no case exceeding a cumulative 
period of six (6) months.
[46]
 

 Finally, in areas declared by the President to be in a state of 
calamity, the President may enact a supplemental budget by way of 
budgetary realignment, to set aside appropriations for the purchase of 
supplies and materials, or for the payment of services which are 
exceptionally urgent or absolutely indispensable to prevent imminent 
danger to, or loss of life or property, in the jurisdiction of an LGU 
concerned.
[47]
 
 From 
the foregoing, it is thus clear that the President has no power to close
 an entire island, even in a calamitous situation, and despite the 
blanket invocation of the State's police power. 
  




The authority to restrict the right
 to travel cannot be implied from the executive department's power, 
under RA 9275, to "take measures necessary to upgrade the water quality"






The 
ponencia
 also views RA 9275
[48]
 as another statutory basis for the issuance of Proclamation 475.
[49]
 This position is anchored on Section 6 of said statute which reads: 
  


 SEC. 6. 
Management of Non-attainment Areas
. â The [DENR] 
shall designate water bodies, or portions thereof, where specific 
pollutants from either natural or man-made source have already exceeded 
water quality guidelines as non-attainment areas for the exceeded 
pollutant. x x x


 The [DENR] shall, in coordination with [National Water Resource 
Board], Department of Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture (DA), 
governing board and other concerned government agencies and private 
sectors 
shall take measures as may be necessary to upgrade the 
quality of such water in non-attainment areas to meet the standards 
under which it has been classified.
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) 




 Again, I disagree. 
 While the language used by RA 9275 was 
general, such that it may include any measure to upgrade the quality of 
water in a particular area, the provision in question is still bound by 
the limitations imposed by the Constitution and other applicable laws. 
 Specifically, RA 9275 itself provides that "[t]he LGUs shall prepare 
and implement

 contingency plans and other measures including relocation, whenever 
necessary, for the protection of health and welfare of the residents 
within potentially affected areas."
[50]

 It is apparent, therefore, that it is again the LGUs who are tasked 
with the implementation of contingency plans when measures need to be 
taken for the protection of the health and welfare of the residents in 
the area concerned. The DENR's, and consequently the President's, 
jurisdiction is limited to the adoption of measures for the 
treatment

 of water, that is, any method, technique, or process designed to alter 
the physical, chemical or biological and radiological character or 
composition of any waste or wastewater to reduce or prevent pollution.
[51]

 More importantly, even if the language employed by RA 9275 was as 
general as it could be to allow leeway for the DENR as to the means it 
would undertake to clean the water, 
the DENR would still 
inarguably be bound by Section 6, Article III of the Constitution, 
which, as discussed, requires that the curtailment of the right to 
travel be done on the basis of a law
. 
  




The right to travel cannot he impaired by a mere Presidential Proclamation






 As discussed, the existence of a law â which may either refer to 
the Constitution or to a statute necessarily enacted by the Legislature â
 is a prerequisite for the curtailment of the right to travel. The case 
of 
Ople v. Torres
[52]
 (
Ople
) lends guidance.   
  
 In 
Ople
, the President sought to establish a national
 computerized identification reference system, or National ID System, 
through a mere administrative order. The petitioner in the said case 
questioned the legality of the administrative order on the ground that, 
among others, the subject of the administrative order should properly be
 contained in a law, not a mere administrative issuance. In declaring 
the administrative order unconstitutional, the Court explained at 
length: 
  


 Petitioner's sedulous concern for the Executive not to trespass 
on the lawmaking domain of Congress is understandable. The blurring of 
the demarcation line between the power of the Legislature to make laws 
and the power of the Executive to execute laws will disturb their 
delicate balance of power and cannot be allowed. Hence, the exercise by 
one branch of government of power belonging to another will be given a 
stricter scrutiny
 by this Court. 


 The line that delineates Legislative and Executive power is not indistinct. 
Legislative power

 is "the authority, under the Constitution, to make laws, and to alter 
and repeal them." The Constitution, as the will of the people in their 
original, sovereign and unlimited capacity, has vested this power in the
 Congress of the Philippines. The grant of legislative power to Congress
 is broad, general and comprehensive. The legislative body possesses 
plenary power for all purposes of civil government. Any power, deemed to
 be legislative by usage and tradition, is necessarily possessed by 
Congress, unless the Constitution has lodged it elsewhere. In fine, 
except as limited by the Constitution, either expressly or impliedly, 
legislative power embraces all subjects and extends to matters of 
general concern or common interest. 


 While Congress is vested with the power to enact laws, 
the President executes the laws
.
 The executive power is vested in the President. It is generally defined
 as the power to enforce and administer the laws. It is the power of 
carrying the laws into practical operation and enforcing their due 
observance. 


 As head of the Executive Department, the President is the Chief 
Executive. He represents the government as a whole and sees to it that 
all laws are enforced by the officials and employees of his department. 
He has control over the executive department, bureaus and offices. This 
means that he has the authority to assume directly the functions of the 
executive department, bureau and office, or interfere with the 
discretion of its officials. Corollary to the power of control, the 
President also has the duty of supervising the enforcement of laws for 
the maintenance of general peace and public order. Thus, he is granted 
administrative power
 over bureaus and offices under his control to enable him to discharge his duties effectively. 


 
Administrative power is concerned with the work of applying 
policies and enforcing orders as determined by proper governmental 
organs. It enables the President to fix a uniform standard of 
administrative efficiency and check the official conduct of his agents. 
To this end, he can issue administrative orders, rules and regulations.
 


 
Prescinding from these precepts, we hold that A.O. No. 308 involves 
a subject that is not appropriate to be covered by an administrative order
. 
An administrative order is: 




 "[Section] 3. Administrative Orders. â Acts of the President 
which relate to particular aspects of governmental operation in 
pursuance of his duties as administrative head shall be promulgated in 
administrative orders." 




 An administrative order is an ordinance issued by the President 
which relates to specific aspects in the administrative operation of 
government. 
It must be in harmony with the law and should be 
for the sole purpose of implementing the law and carrying out the 
legislative policy.
 We reject the argument that A.O. No. 308 implements the legislative policy of the Administrative Code of 1987. x x x


 x x x x


 It cannot be simplistically argued that A.O. No. 308 merely 
implements the Administrative Code of 1987. It establishes for the first
 time a National Computerized Identification Reference System. Such a 
System requires a delicate adjustment of various contending state 
policies â the primacy of national security, the extent of privacy 
interest against dossier-gathering by government, the choice of 
policies, etc. Indeed, the dissent of Mr. Justice Mendoza states that 
the A.O. No. 308 involves the all-important freedom of thought. 
As said administrative order redefines the parameters of some basic rights of our citizenry v
is-a-vis

 the State as well as the line that separates the administrative power 
of the President to make rules and the legislative power of Congress, it
 ought to be evident that it deals with a subject that should be covered
 by law.
 


 Nor is it correct to argue as the dissenters do that A.O. No. 
308 is not a law because it confers no right, imposes no duty, affords 
no protection, and creates no office. 
Under A.O. No. 308, a 
citizen cannot transact business with government agencies delivering 
basic services to the people without the contemplated identification 
card
. No citizen will refuse to get this identification card for
 no one can avoid dealing with government. It is thus clear as daylight 
that without the ID, a citizen will have difficulty exercising his 
rights and enjoying his privileges. Given this reality, the contention 
that A.O. No. 308 gives no right and imposes no duty cannot stand. 


 Again, with due respect, the dissenting opinions unduly expand 
the limits of administrative legislation and consequently erodes the 
plenary power of Congress to make laws. This is contrary to the 
established approach defining the traditional limits of administrative 
legislation. 
As well stated by Fisher: "x x x 
Many regulations 
however, bear directly on the public. It is here that administrative 
legislation must be restricted in its scope and application. Regulations
 are not supposed to be a substitute for tire general policy-making that
 Congress enacts in the form of a public law. Although administrative 
regulations are entitled to respect, the authority to prescribe rules 
and regulations is not an independent source of 	power	to 	make 	laws

 In the present case, the order to close Boracay for six months was issued in a form of a 
proclamation
.
 Title 1, Book III of Executive Order No. 292 or the Revised 
Administrative Code of 1987 (Administrative Code) enumerates the 
different powers of the Office of the President. Chapter 2 of the same â
 which contains the ordinance powers of the President â defines a 
"proclamation" as follows: 
 
BOOK III
 

    Office of the President


TITLE I
 

  Powers of the President


CHAPTER 1
 

    Power of Control




 SECTION 1. 
Power of Control
. â The President shall have 
control of all the executive departments, bureaus, and offices. He shall
 ensure that the laws be faithfully executed. 


 
CHAPTER 2
 

    Ordinance Power


 SEC. 2. 
Executive Orders.
 â Acts of the President 
providing for the rules of a general or permanent character in 
implementation or execution of constitutional or statutory powers shall 
be promulgated in executive orders.

which relate to particular aspects of governmental operations in 
pursuance of his duties as administrative head shall be promulgated in 
administrative orders.


 
SEC. 4. 
Proclamations
. â Acts of the President fixing a
 date or declaring a status or condition of public moment or interest, 
upon the existence of which the operation of a specific law or

. 


SEC. 7. 
General or Special Orders
. â Acts and commands of 
the President in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces 
of the Philippines shall be issued as 
general or special orders
. (Emphasis supplied) 




 The declaration of a state of calamity in the present case was 
embodied in a "proclamation". But that is not all that was covered by 
the "proclamation". Along with the declaration of a state of calamity, 
Proclamation 475 also ordered the closure of an entire island â 
an order which directly impacts fundamental rights, particularly, the right to travel and due process
. Borrowing the words of the Court in 
Ople
, when an issuance "redefines the parameters of some basic rights of our citizenry 
visÂ­ a-vis
 the State,"
[54]

 then such is a subject matter that should be contained in a law. Such 
matters are beyond the power of the President to determine, and cannot 
be undertaken merely upon the authority of a proclamation. 
 As explained by Justice Dante O. Tinga in 
David v. MacapagalÂ­ Arroyo
:
[55]




 x x x The power of the President to make proclamations, while 
confirmed by statutory grant, is nonetheless rooted in an inherent power
 of the presidency and not expressly subjected to constitutional 
limitations. But proclamations, by their nature, are a species of 
issuances of extremely limited efficacy. As defined in the 
Administrative Code, proclamations are merely "acts of the President 
fixing a date or declaring a status or condition of public moment or 
interest upon the existence of which the operation of a specific law or 
regulation is made to depend". 
A proclamation, on its own, cannot 
create or suspend any constitutional or statutory rights or obligations.
 There would be need of a complementing law or regulation referred to in
 the proclamation
 should such act indeed put into operation any law 
or regulation by fixing a date or declaring a status or condition of a 
public moment or interest related to such law or regulation. And should 
the proclamation allow the operationalization of such law or regulation,
 all subsequent resultant acts cannot exceed or supersede the law or 
regulation that was put into effect.
[56]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 In sum, as the governmental action at hand involves the 
curtailment of the constitutionally guarded right to travel, it was thus
 invalid for the President to have done so (i) without enabling 
legislation and (ii) in the form of a mere proclamation. 
  




The authority to curtail the right 
to travel is neither subsumed in the President's duty to execute laws, 
nor can it be deemed inherent in the President's power to promote the 
general welfare






In the absence of statutory and Constitutional basis, it is 
imperative to stress that the restriction of the right to travel, as 
imposed through Proclamation 475, cannot be justified as a necessary 
incident of the Executive's duty to execute laws. 
  
 The faithful execution clause is found in Section 17, Article VII of the Constitution. It states: 
  


 SEC. 17. The President shall have control of all the executive 
departments, bureaus and offices. He shall ensure that the laws be 
faithfully executed. 




 The foregoing clause should not be understood as a grant of power, but rather, an obligation imposed upon the President.
[57]

 In turn, this obligation should not be construed in the narrow context 
of the particular statute to be carried out, but, more appropriately, in
 conjunction with the very document from which such obligation emanates.
 Hence, speaking of the faithful execution clause, the Court has ruled: 
  


 [The faithful execution clause] simply underscores the rule of law and, corollarily, the cardinal principle that
 the President is not above the laws but is obliged to obey and execute them
.
 This is precisely why the law provides that "administrative or 
executive acts, orders and regulations shall be valid only when they are
 not contrary to the laws or the Constitution."
[58]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Based on these premises, I cannot subscribe to the position that 
the restriction of the right to travel imposed as a consequence of 
Boracay's closure is valid simply because it is necessary for the 
island's rehabilitation. 
The fact that the restriction of the right 
to travel is deemed necessary to achieve the avowed purpose of 
Proclamation 475 does not take such restriction away from the scope of 
the Constitutional requirements under Section 6, Article III.
 

 As well, I cannot agree with respondents' contention that the authority
 to restrict the right to travel is inherent in the exercise of the 
President's residual power to protect and promote the general welfare.
[59]
 This claim appears to result from an analogy drawn from the Court's rulings in 
Silverio v. Court of Appeals
[60]
 (Silverio) and 
Leave Division, Office of the Administrative Services, Office of the Court Administrator v. Heusdens
[61]
 (
Leave Division
), which speak of the inherent powers of the judicial and legislative departments.
 A close reading of these cases reveals, however, that respondents' claim does not find support in either 
Silverio
 or
 Leave Division
. 
 In 
Silverio
,
 the petitioner therein had been charged with a violation of the Revised
 Securities Act. The petitioner assailed the order issued by the 
handling Regional Trial Court (RTC) which directed: (i) the Department 
of Foreign Affairs to cancel his passport; and (ii) then Commission on 
Immigration to prevent him from leaving the Philippines.
[62]

 The petitioner further argued that the RTC could not validly impair his
 right to travel on the basis of grounds other than national security, 
public safety and public health.
[63]
 

 Resolving the issue, the Court held that Section 6, Article III should 
not be construed to limit the inherent power of the courts to use all 
means necessary to carry their orders into effect, thus: 
  


 Petitioner takes 	the posture, 	however, that 	while the 1987 
Constitution recognizes the power of the Courts to curtail the liberty 
of abode within the limits prescribed by law, it restricts the allowable
 impairment of the right to travel only on grounds of interest of 
national security, public safety or public health, as compared to the 
provisions on freedom of movement in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions. 


 x x x x 


Petitioner x x x theorizes that under the 1987 Constitution, 
Courts can impair the right to travel only on the grounds of "national 
security, public safety, or public health." 


 The submission is not well taken. 


 
Article III, Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution should be 
interpreted to mean that while the liberty of travel may be impaired 
even without Court Order, 
the appropriate executive officers or administrative authorities are not armed with arbitrary discretion to impose limitations
.
 They can impose limits only on the basis of "national security, public 
safety, or public health" and "as may be provided by law," 
a limitive phrase which did not appear in the 1973 text

 x x x. Apparently, the phraseology in the 1987 Constitution was a 
reaction to the ban on international travel imposed under the previous 
regime when there was a Travel Processing Center, which issued 
certificates of eligibility to travel upon application of an interested 
party x x x.


 
Article III, Section 6 of the 1987 Constitution should by no means be construed as delimiting the 
inherent power of the Courts
 to use all means necessary to carry their orders into effect in criminal cases pending before them. 
When
 by law jurisdiction is conferred on a Court or judicial officer, all 
auxiliary writs, process and other means necessary to carry it into 
effect may be employed by such Court or officer
 x x x. 


 x x x x 


 Petitioner is facing a criminal charge. He has posted bail but 
has violated the conditions thereof by failing to appear before the 
Court when required. Warrants for his arrest have been issued. Those 
orders and processes would be rendered nugatory if an accused were to be
 allowed to leave or to remain, at his pleasure, outside the territorial
 confines of the country. Holding an accused in a criminal case within 
the reach of the Courts by preventing his departure from the Philippines
 must be considered as a valid restriction on his right to travel so 
that he may be dealt with in accordance with law. The offended party in 
any criminal proceeding is the People of the Philippines. It is to their
 best interest that criminal prosecutions should run their course and 
proceed to finality without undue delay, with an accused holding himself
 amenable at all times to Court Orders and processes.
[64]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted) 




 In 
Leave Division
, petitioner therein argued that the 
Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) Circular No. 49-2003 (B), which 
requires court employees to secure a travel authority as a requisite for
 foreign travel, unduly restricts the right to travel.
 Speaking of "inherent limitations on the right to travel", the Court in 
Leave Division
 held: 
  


 Inherent limitations on the right to travel are those that 
naturally emanate from the source. These are very basic and are built-in
 with the power. An example of such inherent limitation is the power of 
the trial courts to prohibit persons charged with a crime to leave the 
country. In such a case, permission of the court is necessary. 
Another
 is the inherent power of the legislative department to conduct a 
congressional inquiry in aid of legislation. In the exercise of 
legislative inquiry, Congress has the power to issue a 
subpoena
 and 
subpoena duces tecum

 to a witness in any part of the country, signed by the chairperson or 
acting chairperson and the Speaker or acting Speaker of the House; or in
 the case of the Senate, signed by its Chairman or in his absence by the
 Acting Chairman, and approved by the Senate President
.
[65]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 While the foregoing cases decree that the requirements of Section 
6, Article III should not be interpreted to unduly negate the inherent 
powers belonging to the judicial and legislative departments, these 
cases do not purport to sanction the curtailment of the right to travel 
solely on the basis of implication. 
 
To be sure, the authority to restrict the right to travel, while inherent in the exercise of judicial power 
and

 in the conduct of legislative inquiry, do not stem from mere 
abstraction, but rather, proceed from specific grants of authority under
 the Constitution. These grants of authority therefore satisfy the 
requirement that the restriction be provided for by law.
 
 To 
recall, Section 5(5), Article VIII of the Constitution vests unto the 
Court the power to promulgate rules concerning, among others, the 
protection and enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice 
and procedure in all courts. Pursuant to such authority, the Court 
promulgated the Rules 135 of the Rules of Court, which reads: 
  


 SEC. 6. 
Means to carry jurisdiction into effect
. â When 
by law jurisdiction is conferred on a court or judicial officer, all 
auxiliary writs, processes and other means necessary to carry it into 
effect may be employed by such court or officer; and if the procedure to
 be followed in the exercise of such jurisdiction is not specifically 
pointed out by law or by these rules, any suitable process or mode of 
proceeding may be adopted which appears comfortable to the spirit of the
 said law or rules. 




 In this connection, the jurisdiction to exercise judicial power 
and exert all means necessary to carry such jurisdiction into effect is 
conferred upon the lower courts 
by law
, specifically, under Batas Pambansa Bilang 129. 

 Similarly, the Legislature's power to promulgate rules governing the 
conduct of a congressional inquiry stems from Section 21, Article VI of 
the Constitution, thus: 
  


 SEC. 21. The Senate or the House of Representatives or any of 
its respective committees may conduct inquiries in aid of legislation in 
accordance with its duly published rules of procedure. The rights of 
persons appearing in or affected by such inquiries shall be respected. 




 In turn, the Congress' power to resort to coercive measures in the
 course of legislative inquiry have been detailed in their respective 
internal rules promulgated pursuant to Section 21.
[66]
 
 Plainly, there is no basis to conclude that these inherent powers constitute 
exceptions

 to the parameters set forth by Section 6, Article III, for the reason 
that the Constitution itself provides the basis for their exercise. 

 Nevertheless, respondents argue, by analogy, that the authority to 
restrict the right to travel is inherent in the President's exercise of 
residual powers to protect general welfare.
[67]
 In support of this proposition, respondents rely on 
Marcos v. Manglapus
[68]
 (
Marcos
), the relevant portion of which reads: 
  


 x x x The power involved is the President's residual power to 
protect the general welfare of the people. It is founded on the duty of 
the President, as steward of the people. To paraphrase Theodore 
Roosevelt, it is not only the power of the President but also his duty 
to do anything not forbidden by the Constitution or the laws that the 
needs of the nation demand. x x x


 x x x The President is not only clothed with extraordinary 
powers in times of emergency, but is also tasked with attending to the 
day-to-day problems of maintaining peace and order and ensuring domestic
 tranquillity in times when no foreign foe appears on the horizon. Wide 
discretion, within the bounds of law, in fulfilling presidential duties 
in times of peace is not in any way diminished by the relative want of 
an emergency specified in the commander-in-chief provision. x x x
[69]
 (Citations omitted) 




 I cannot subscribe to this position. 
 To echo the Court's words in
 Genuino
, the imposition of a restriction on the right to travel may not be justified by resorting to an analogy.
[70]
 

 A closer look at the very limited cases in which the President's 
unstated "residual powers" and "broad discretion" have been recognized
[71]

 reveals that the exercise of these residual powers can only be 
justified in the existence of circumstances posing a threat to the 
general welfare of the people so imminent that it requires 
immediate
 action on the part of the government. 
 In 
Marcos
,
 these circumstances were "the catalytic effect of the return of the 
Marcoses that may pose a serious threat to the national interest and 
welfare",
[72]
 the fact that 
the country was only then "beginning to recover from the hardships 
brought about by the plunder of the economy attributed to the Marcoses 
and their close associates and relatives, many of whom are still here in
 the Philippines in a position to destabilize the country, while the 
Government has barely scratched the surface, in its efforts to recover 
the enormous wealth stashed away by the Marcoses in foreign 
jurisdictions".
[73]
 The distinctiveness of these circumstances impelled the Court to thus treat its pronouncement therein as 
sui generis
: 
  


 
This case is unique. It should not create a precedent
, 
for the case of a dictator forced out of office and into exile after 
causing twenty years of political, economic and social havoc in the 
country and who within the short space of three years seeks to return, 
is in a class by itself.
[74]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 I submit, therefore, that respondents' reliance on the Court's ruling in 
Marcos
 as basis to determine the scope of the President's "residual powers" is erroneous. 

 In any case, the "residual powers" as referred to in Section 20, 
Chapter 7, Title I, Book III of the Administrative Code, refers to the 
President's power to "exercise such other powers and functions vested 
[in the President] which are provided for under the laws and which are 
not specifically enumerated above, or which are not delegated by the 
President in accordance with law." 
 While residual powers are, by
 their nature, "unstated," these powers are vested in the President in 
furtherance of the latter's duties under the Constitution. 
To exempt residual powers from the restrictions set forth by the very same document from which they emanate is absurd. 
While residual powers are "unstated", they are 
not
 extra-constitutional
. 
  
 Indeed, while the President possesses the residual powers in 
times of calamity, these powers are limited by, and must therefore be 
wielded within, the bounds set forth by the Constitution and applicable 
laws enabling such powers' exercise. As aptly observed by the Supreme 
Court in 
Rodriguez, Sr. v. Gella
:
[75]




 
Shelter may not be sought in the proposition that the 
President should be allowed to exercise emergency powers for the sake of
 speed and expediency in the interest and for the welfare of the people,
 because we have the Constitution, designed to establish a government 
under a regime of justice, liberty and democracy.
 x x x Much as it 
is imperative in some cases to have prompt official action, deadlocks in
 and slowness of democratic processes must be preferred to concentration
 of powers in any one man or group of men for obvious reasons. The 
framers of the Constitution, however, had the vision of and were careful
 in allowing delegation of legislative powers to the President for a 
limited period "in times of war or other national emergency." They had 
thus entrusted to the good judgment of the Congress the duty of coping 
with any national emergency by a more efficient procedure; but it alone 
must decide because emergency in itself cannot and should not create 
power. In our democracy the hope and survival of the nation lie in the 
wisdom and unselfish patriotism of all officials and in their faithful 
adherence to the Constitution."
[76]
 (Emphasis supplied) 




 Inasmuch as the President has the power to ensure the faithful execution of laws,
[77]

 and to protect the general welfare of the people, such power can, by no
 means, be wielded at every turn, or be unduly expanded to create 
"inherent restrictions" upon fundamental rights protected by the 
Constitution. 
  




There are Constitutionally permissible measures to address the problem






In the resolution of this Petition, the 
ponencia
 and the related concurring opinions appear to harp on the 
necessity
 of the governmental action involved, 
i.e
., closure of the entire island to solve the problem at hand. The 
ponencia
, for instance, states: 
  


 
Certainly, the closure of Boracay, albeit temporarily, 
gave the island its much needed breather, and likewise afforded the 
government the necessary leeway in its rehabilitation program.
 
Note that apart from review, evaluation and amendment of relevant 
policies, the bulk of the rehabilitation activities involved inspection,
 testing, demolition, relocation, and construction. These works could 
not have easily been done with tourists present. The rehabilitation 
works in the first place were not simple, superficial or mere cosmetic 
but rather quite complicated, major, and permanent in character as they 
were intended to serve as long-term solutions to the problem. 
Also,
 time is of the essence. Every precious moment lost is to the detriment 
of Boracay's environment and of the health and well-being of the people 
thereat.
 Hence, any unnecessary distraction or disruption is 
most unwelcome. Moreover, as part of the rehabilitation efforts, 
operations of establishments in Boracay had to be halted in the course 
thereof since majority, if not all of them, need to comply with 
environmental and regulatory requirements in order to align themselves 
with the government's goal to restore Boracay into normalcy and develop 
its sustainability. Allowing tourists into the island while it was 
undergoing necessary rehabilitation would therefore be pointless as no 
establishment would cater to their accommodation and other needs. 
Besides,
 it could not be said that Boracay, at the time of the issuance of the 
questioned proclamation, was in such a physical state that would meet 
its purpose of being a tourist destination.
 For one, its beach 
waters could not be said to be totally safe for swimming. In any case, 
the closure, to emphasize, was only for a definite period of six months,
 i.e
.,
 from April 26, 2018 to October 25, 2018. To the mind of the Court, this
 period constitutes a reasonable time frame, if not to complete, but to 
at least put in place the necessary rehabilitation works to be done in 
the island. Indeed, the temporary closure of Boracay, although 
unprecedented and radical as it may seem, was reasonably necessary and 
not unduly oppressive under the circumstances. 
It was the most 
practical and realistic means of ensuring that rehabilitation works in 
the island are started and carried out in the most efficacious and 
expeditious way.
 x x x
[78]
 (Emphases and underscoring supplied) 




 As I earlier intimated in this opinion, I concede and recognize 
that Boracay was facing a critical problem that necessitated its 
closure. I do acknowledge that there was both 
necessity
 and 
urgency

 to act on the island's problem. Nonetheless, at the risk of being 
repetitive, I reiterate that the closure was invalid without an enabling
 law enacted for the purpose â 
a 
requirement that is neither impossible nor unreasonable to comply with
.
 
 To illustrate, under the Constitution, the President may certify a bill as urgent "to meet a public calamity or emergency."
[79]
 Thus: 
  


 No bill passed by either House shall become a law unless it has 
passed three readings on separate days, and printed copies thereof in 
its final form have been distributed to its Members three days before 
its passage, 
except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or emergency
.
 Upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto shall be allowed,
 and the vote thereon shall be taken immediately thereafter, and the 
yeas
 and 
nays
 entered in the Journal. (emphasis supplied) 




 In 
Tolentino vs. Secretary of Finance
,
[80]
 the Court ruled that the President's certification dispenses with the requirement of (i) three readings 
on separate days
 and (ii) of printing and distribution 
three days before its passage
.
 This constitutional mechanism allows the President to communicate to 
Congress what the government's priority measures are, and allows these 
same bills to "skip" what otherwise would be a rather burdensome and 
time-consuming procedure in the legislative process. Stated differently,
 this certification provides a constitutionally sanctioned procedure for
 the passing of urgent matters that needed to be in the form of a law. 
 Indeed, this is not uncharted territory. The Court can take judicial notice
[81]

 of the fact that, for instance, the bill that would later on become the
 Bangsamoro Organic Law was certified as urgent on May 29, 2018.
[82]
 In less than two months, or by July 26, 2018, the bill was already signed into law.
[83]

  Another example is the passage of the Responsible Parenthood and 
Reproductive Health Act. After its second reading in the House of 
Representatives on December 12, 2012, the Reproductive Health (RH) Bill 
was certified as urgent by the then President on December 13, 2012.
[84]

 The House of Representatives and Senate approved the measure on third 
reading on December 17, 2012 and ratified its final version on December 
19, 2012.
[85]
 By December 21, 2012, 
or merely eight days from the certification of the bill as urgent
, the RH Bill was signed into law.
[86]
 

 There is thus clear precedent on the effectiveness of this mechanism. 
Regrettably, it was not resorted to in addressing Boracay's problems. 
Instead, an unconstitutional shortcut was taken by merely issuing a 
proclamation
 to close the island. 
 This unconstitutional shortcut is, to repeat, the 
raison d'etre

 for this dissent. The situation in Boracay is undoubtedly dire; yet, 
there are constitutionally permissible measures that the government 
could, and should, have taken to address the problem. 
  




The protection afforded by the 
right to due process, as asserted in connection with one's right to 
work, applies with equal force to all persons, regardless of their 
profession






Finally, the 
ponencia
 declares that petitioners Zabal and 
Jacosalem, being part of the informal economy sector where earnings are 
not guaranteed, cannot be said to have already acquired vested rights to
 their sources of income in Boracay. Since their earnings are 
contingent, the 
ponencia
 proceeds to conclude that petitioners have no vested rights to their sources of income as to be entitled to due process.
[87]


 I disagree. 
 Section 1, Article III on the Bill of 
Rights of the Constitution provides that "[n]o person shall be deprived 
of life, liberty, or property without due process of law x x x." 
Property protected under this constitutional provision includes
 the 
right
 to work and the right to earn a living
. 
 In 
JMM Promotion and Management, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,
[88]
 which was cited by the 
ponencia
,
 the Court held that "[a] profession, trade or calling is a property 
right within the meaning of our constitutional guarantees. One cannot be
 deprived of the right to work and the right to make a living because 
these rights are property rights, the arbitrary and unwarranted 
deprivation of which normally constitutes an actionable wrong."
[89]
 

 Notwithstanding this constitutional protection, the right to property 
is not absolute as it may be curtailed through a valid exercise of the 
State's police power.
[90]
 However, such deprivation must be done with due process. 
 The 
ponencia
 concedes that one's profession or trade is considered a property right covered by the due process clause.
[91]
 However, the 
ponencia
 is of the position that petitioner Zabal and Jacosalem's right thereto is merely inchoate, reasoning as follows: 
  


 In any case, petitioners, particularly Zabal and Jacosalem, 
cannot be said to have already acquired vested rights to their sources 
of income in Boracay. As heretofore mentioned, they are part of the 
informal sector of the economy where earnings are not guaranteed. x x x


 x x x Clearly, said petitioners' earnings are contingent in 
that, even assuming tourists are still allowed in the island, they will 
still earn nothing if no one avails of their services. Certainly, they 
do not possess any vested right on their sources of income, and under 
this context, their claim of lack of due process collapses. To stress, 
only rights which have completely and definitely accrued and settled are
 entitled protection under the due process clause.
[92]
 




 There is no question that petitioners have no vested right to 
their future income. However, what is involved here is not necessarily 
the right to their future income; 
rather, it is petitioners' 
existing and present right
 to work and to earn a living
.
 To belabor the point, such right is not inchoate â on the contrary, it 
is constitutionally recognized and protected. The fact that petitioner 
Zabal and Jacosalem's professions yield variable income (as opposed to 
fixed income) does not, in any way, dilute the protection afforded them 
by the Constitution. 
 On this score, I take exception to the 
position that petitioners Zabal and Jacosalem lack legal standing to 
file the present Petition.
[93]
 
 
Locus standi 
or legal standing is the right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question.
[94]

 In order to possess the necessary legal standing, a party must show a 
personal and substantial interest in the case such that s/he has 
sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the challenged 
governmental act.
[95]
 This 
requirement of direct injury "guarantees that the party who brings suit 
has such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy and, in 
effect, assures 'that concrete adverseness which sharpens the 
presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of 
difficult constitutional questions."'
[96]
 
 In their petition, petitioners stated that: 
  


 106. Petitioners Zabal and Jacosalem's daily earnings from their
 tourism-related activities are absolutely necessary to put food on the 
table, send their children to school, and cover the daily expenses of 
their families. 


 107. Without such sources of income â even if only for a period 
of six (6) months â said petitioners' families will go hungry and, 
worse, be uprooted or forced to relocate to other places. Such a 
development would disrupt their children's schooling and work untold 
hardships upon their families. 


 108. Petitioners have every right to continue to earn a living 
in the manner they so choose which, and depriving them of their 
livelihood violates such right and creates untold hardships for them and
 their families.
[97]




 Applying jurisprudential standards, the inescapable conclusion is 
that petitioners Zabal and Jacosalem unquestionably have legal standing.
 Undoubtedly, they have a personal and substantial interest in this case
 and they have shown that they would sustain direct injury as a result 
of the Boracay closure. 
  In denying petitioners any legal standing, the 
ponencia
 cites 
Galicto v. Aquino III,
[98]
 (
Galicto
)
 a case involving the constitutionality of Executive Order No. (E.O.) 7 
issued by President Benigno Aquino III which ordered, among others, a 
moratorium on the increases in the salaries and other forms of 
compensation of all government owned and controlled corporations 
(GOCCs). The 
ponencia
 summarized the ruling therein as follows: 
  


 x x x The Court held that Galicto, an employee of the GOCC 
Philhealth, has no legal standing to assail [E.O.] 7 for his failure to 
demonstrate that he has a personal stake or material interest in the 
outcome of the case. His interest, if any, was speculative and based on a
 mere expectancy. Future increases in his salaries and other benefits 
were contingent events or expectancies to which he has no vested rights.
 Hence, he possessed no 
locus standi 
to question the curtailment thereof.
[99]




 Applying the foregoing principles, the 
ponencia
 finds that petitioners Zabal and Jacosalem do not have standing to file the instant petition, reasoning that: 
  


 x x x, Zabal is a sandcastle maker and Jacosalem, a [tricycle] 
driver. The nature of their livelihood is one wherein earnings are not 
guaranteed. As correctly pointed out by respondents, their earnings are 
not fixed and may vary depending on the business climate in that while 
they can earn much on peak seasons, it is also possible for them not to 
earn anything on lean seasons, especially when the rainy days set in. 
Zabal and Jacosalem could not have been oblivious to this kind of 
situation, they having been in the practice of their trade for a 
considerable length of time. Clearly, therefore, what Zabal and 
Jacosalem could lose in this case are mere projected earnings which are 
in no way guaranteed, and are sheer expectancies characterized as 
contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest, just like in 
Galicto
.
 Concomitantly, an assertion of direct injury on the basis of loss of 
income does not clothe Zabal and Jacosalem with legal standing.
[100]




 Contrary to the foregoing supposition, 
Galicto
 is inapplicable in this case.
  In 
Galicto
,
 the Court correctly ruled that Galicto's interest was merely 
speculative and based on a mere expectancy because he has no vested 
rights to salary increases and, therefore, the absence of such right 
deprives him of legal standing to assail E.O. 7. 
The same ruling 
cannot be applied in the instant case. The impairment of petitioners' 
rights as a consequence of the closure of Boracay gives rise to 
interests that are real, and not merely speculative.
 There is no
 doubt that they will be directly affected by the closure because they 
derive their income on tourism-related activities in Boracay. While
 Galicto

 was concerned about future increases, what is involved in the present 
case is petitioners' constitutionally protected right to work and earn a
 living.
[101]
 To stress, the 
fact that petitioners Zabal and Jacosalem's professions yield variable 
income does not, in any way, dilute the protection they are entitled to 
under the Constitution. 
 
Conclusion
 I end 
this discourse fully cognizant of the unfortunate realities that the 
island of Boracay has faced. I do not attempt to ignore the degradation 
it has suffered in the hands of those who have refused to comply with 
statutes, rules and regulations crafted for its protection. 
 
When
 the exigencies of times call for limitations on fundamental rights, it 
is incumbent upon Congress to respond to the need by explicitly 
authorizing such limitations through law
.
[102]
 While the President has the power, 
nay
,
 duty, to address such exigencies, the necessity of impairing 
constitutional rights in connection therewith is not for him to 
determine, more so, unilaterally impose, most particularly in cases 
where, as here, there is an absence of any indication that Congress 
would be unable to respond to the call. 
 The requirements under 
Section 6, Article III of the Constitution are as clear as they are 
absolute. The parameters for their application have been drawn in deft 
strokes by the Court in 
Genuino
 promulgated just nine (9) months 
ago. Respondents' shotgun attempt to carve out an exception to these 
requirements in order to justify the issuance of Proclamation 475 
actually betrays their complete awareness of the Proclamation's nullity.
 In 
Genuino
, the Court warned against the sacrifice of individual
 liberties for a perceived good as this is disastrous to a democracy. 
Therein, the Court emphasized: 
  


 One of the basic principles of the democratic system is that 
where the rights of the individual are concerned, the end does not 
justify the means. It is not enough that there be a valid objective; it 
is also necessary that the means employed to pursue it be in keeping 
with the Constitution. Mere expediency will not excuse constitutional 
shortcuts. There is no question that not even the strongest moral 
conviction or the most urgent public need, subject only to a few notable
 exceptions, will excuse the bypassing of an individual's rights. It is 
no exaggeration to say that a person invoking a right guaranteed under 
Article III of the Constitution is a majority of one even as against the
 rest of the nation who would deny him that right.
[103]




 The Court did not hesitate to protect the Constitution against the threat of executive overreach in 
Genuino
. The refusal to do so now is nothing less than bewildering. 

 The judicial validation of Proclamation 475 lends itself to abuse. It 
grants the President the power to encroach upon fundamental 
constitutional rights at whim, upon the guise of "faithful execution," 
and under a sweeping claim of "necessity." The 
ponencia
 lauds the
 "bold and urgent action" taken by the present government, but in the 
process, lost sight that it did so at the expense of fundamental rights.
 Undue premium has been placed on the underlying necessity for which the
 remedial action was taken, and the speed in which it was implemented. 
As a consequence, the inviolability of constitutionally protected rights
 has been forgotten. 
 I invite everyone, both within and outside 
the confines of this judicial institution, to learn from history. The 
Berlin Wall â the border system that divided a country physically and 
ideologically for nearly three decades â was said to have been built 
overnight. For a modern democracy, such as ours, that is struggling to 
strike a balance between maintaining the integrity of its institutions 
and dealing with its inefficiencies, the swiftness with which the Berlin
 Wall was built may be astonishing, if not enviable. 
 Yet, it is 
well to be reminded that the Berlin Wall was constructed at the 
initiative of a leader perceived by many as a dictator. If this country 
is to remain a democracy â as opposed to a dictatorship â the challenge 
for all of us is to accept that progressive and sustainable changes 
require much time. 
 To my mind, this
 ponencia,
 which 
prioritizes swiftness of action over the rule of law, leads to the 
realization of the very evil against which the Constitution had been 
crafted to guard against â 
tyranny
, in its most dangerous 
form. To say that we believe in our Constitution, and yet discard it so 
easily because of expediency, is to champion hypocrisy to the detriment 
of our national soul. 
 In view of the foregoing, I vote to 
GRANT
 the Petition.

 394 U.S. 618 
(1969). Penned for the majority by Associate Justice William J. Brennan,

Justice Black were of the position that Congress has the power to impose
 and authorize nationwide residence requirements under the "commerce 
clause". (Id. at 651.) Justice Harlan, on the other hand, was of the 
view that "a number of considerations militate in favor of [the] 
constitutionality [of the assailed provisions]", particularly, that (i) 
"legitimate governmental interests are furthered by [the] residence 
requirements"; (ii) "the impact of the requirements upon the freedom of 
individuals to travel to interstate is indirect" and "according to [the]
 evidence, x x x insubstantial"; (iii) the assailed provisions are not 
attempts to interfere with the right of citizens to travel, but a case 
where the states act within the terms of a limited authorization by the 
National Government; and (iv) the legislatures which have enacted the 
assailed provisions have rejected appellees' objections after "mature 
deliberation". (Id. at 674.)
