MARVIN L. SAN JUAN, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.


D E C I S I O N




LOPEZ, J., J.:


Before this Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court assailing the Decision
[2]
 and the Resolution
[3]
 rendered by the Court of Appeals (
CA
) in CA-G.R. CR. No. 38091. In the assailed rulings, the CA affirmed the Decision
[4]
 of Branch 270, Regional Trial Court  (
RTC
) of 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
, finding petitioner Marvin L. San Juan (
San Juan
) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of grave threats, in relation to Section 10(a) of Republic Act (
R.A.
) No. 7610.
  
 The Antecedents


 The instant case stemmed from an Information
[5]
 dated July 31, 2014 filed against San Juan, the accusatory portion of which reads: 
  


 That on or about March 26, 2014, in 
xxxxxxxxxxx

	and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, who was drunk, without any justifiable cause, did then and 
there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously threaten the life of one 
[AAA],
[6]
 15 years old (DOB: 
May 5, 1998) (complainant) by poking a gun at him, an act amounting to a
 crime, thereby subjecting said minor to psychological cruelty and 
emotional maltreatment. 


 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[7]
 




 On August 26, 2014, San Juan was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty to the offense charged.
[8]
 Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.
[9]


 As narrated by the prosecution, on March 26, 2014, at around 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., AAA, who was then 15 years old,
[10]
 was chatting with his friends at the basketball court in 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
. Moments later, an inebriated San Juan, who lived nearby, arrived and began scolding AAA. In his tirade, San Juan exclaimed "
pag-uuntugin ang magulang
," to which AAA laughed. At this, San Juan got mad and threatened AAA with a stone.
[11]


 BBB,
[12]
 who was 11 years old at the time, testified that he and his friends, AAA and CCC,
[13]

 were hanging out at the basketball court when San Juan arrived and 
began hurling invectives towards AAA. AAA walked away, which caused San 
Juan to pull out his gun and point it at the back of his friend.
[14]

 With San Juan warning them not to hang out at the basketball court 
anymore, the three friends left. When AAA went back to get his t-shirt 
that he left in their rush to get away from San Juan, the latter chased 
him with a stone.
[15]
 BBB believed that San Juan picked on AAA because the latter was new in their place.
[16]

  On the part of the defense, San Juan testified that on March 26, 2014,
 at around 9:00 a.m., he was on his way home when he saw AAA and his 
friends playing at the basketball court. After introducing himself as a 
police officer, he reminded them that they were not allowed to play 
basketball there during weekdays, and that many people were still 
sleeping at that time.
[17]
 
Instead of obeying, AAA and his friends laughed at him and ignored his 
admonitions. He felt insulted and when the three started to run away, he
 chased them with a stone.
[18]

 San Juan, however, denied pointing a gun at AAA, saying that he left it
 at home. He added that he was not drunk because he just came home from 
his duty and his store.
[19]
  After due proceedings, the RTC rendered a Decision
[20]
 dated July 22, 2015, finding San Juan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of child abuse under Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610,
[21]
 the dispositive portion of which states:
  


 
WHEREFORE
, in the light of the foregoing, judgment is
 hereby rendered finding accused [Special Police Officer 2 (SPO2)] 
MARVIN SAN JUAN @ ["]SIR SJ" guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Child 
Abuse in violation of Section 10 (a) of RA 7610 and he is hereby 
sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of four years [and] eight 
months, as minimum to six years, as maximum[,] and to indemnify the 
minor complainant the amount of [PHP] 50,000.00.
[22]
 (Emphasis in the original)




  In so ruling, the RTC was convinced that San Juan pointed a gun 
at AAA, as his denial cannot be overcome by the categorical, credible 
and positive testimony of BBB.
[23]
 
 On appeal, the CA affirmed San Juan's conviction with modification.
[24]
 The dispositive portion of the decision states:
  


 WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of Branch 270 of the Regional Trial Court of 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
,
 dated July 22, 2015 in Criminal Case No. 958-V-14 finding 
accused-appellant SPO2 Marvin San Juan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
 Grave Threats in relation to Republic Act No. 7610, is hereby MODIFIED 
as follows: 


 Accused-appellant SPO2 Marvin San Juan is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of [four (4)] years, [
nine (9)
]
 months and
 
[
eleven (11)
] 
days
 
of
 
prision correccional
, as minimum, to [seven (7)] years, [four (4)] months and one (1) day of [
prision mayor
],
 as the maximum. He is ORDERED to pay the private complainant [AAA] 
[PHP] 20,000.00 as moral damages, [PHP] 20,000.00 as exemplary damages, 
and [PHP] 20,000.00 as temperate damages, plus interest at the rate of 
6% per annum on each item of the civil liability reckoned from the 
finality of this 
decision until full payment
.
[25]
 (Emphasis in the original)




 The CA found that there were no material contradictions and 
inconsistencies in the testimonies of AAA and BBB, which would have cast
 serious doubt on the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses. On one
 hand, AAA testified that San Juan was holding a stone. On the other 
hand, BBB testified that San Juan pointed a gun at AAA. These are not 
necessarily two conflicting versions. AAA only saw the holding of a 
stone, while it was BBB who actually saw San Juan point a gun at AAA.
[26]
 

 The CA thus held that San Juan clearly went overboard and did more than
 what was necessary to call AAA out. Even if AAA was insulting him, San 
Juan should not have threatened and chased him with a stone, or pointed a
 gun while the boy's back was facing him.
[27]
 

 Moreover, the CA stated that pointing a gun at the back of AAA was a 
highly intimidating act, which would cause fear even to a full-grown 
adult, and even worse when it was done by a man who is a member of the 
police force. The CA considered this as maltreatment that debased and 
caused fear to a minor, especially one who was new to the community.
[28]

 For this reason, the CA sustained the findings of the RTC, with 
modification as to the nomenclature of the crime and the penalty.
 Hence, the instant Petition. 
 Issue




 Whether the CA erred in finding Marvin L. San Juan guilty of 
grave threats in relation to violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act 
No. 7610




 
Our Ruling


 We modify the decision of the CA. 
 It is a fundamental rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on 
certiorari

 under Rule 45. The factual findings of the trial court, especially when
 affirmed by the CA, are generally binding and conclusive on this Court.
 This Court is not a trier of facts. It is not duty-bound to analyze, 
review, and weigh the evidence all over again in the absence of any 
showing of arbitrariness, capriciousness, or palpable error. A departure
 from the general rule may only be warranted in cases where the findings
 of fact of the CA are contrary to the findings of the trial court or 
when these are unsupported by the evidence on record.
[29]
 

 In this case, we find no reason to disturb the factual findings of the 
RTC as affirmed by the CA. The RTC was able to observe the demeanor and,
 in turn, assess the testimony of the witnesses. While the act of 
pointing a gun was narrated by AAA only in his 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
,
[30]

 BBB was able to affirm this statement when he took the witness stand 
and testified that San Juan indeed poked a gun at AAA. Clearly, San Juan
 did not only threaten AAA with a stone but also with a gun. The 
testimony of BBB reads: 
  






Q


While sitting down, do you recall any unusual incident that happened?






A


Yes Sir.






 


 






Q


What is that?






A


SPO2 Marvin San Juan arrived and parked
 his vehicle in front of the basketball court. When he alighted from the
 vehicle, we saw that he was drunk and he suddenly shouted invectives at
 [AAA]. He seemed to single out [AAA] because when [AAA] was about to 
walk away, Sir SJ suddenly pulled out his gun and pointed it to [AAA], 
Sir. 






 


 






Q


Why did he pick on [AAA] instead of you or the other one?






A


 
I do not know, Sir.






 


 






Q


So you saw the accused SPO2 San Juan [draw] his gun and [point] it at [AAA]? 






A


Yes sir. 






 






x x x x 






 






 
The Court: 








What was Police Officer San Juan saying, if any?






Witness:








He was cursing, Your Honor. 






 






The Court: 








Exactly, what did you hear? 
Yung natatandaan mo lang, yung tumanim sa isip mo.






Witness: 








"
Tang-ina daw po ni
 [AAA] 
tapos huwag na daw po siyang dadaan doon
." 






 


 






Q


So [AAA's] back was facing SPO2 San Juan when the gun was pointed at him? 






A


Yes sir.






 


 






Q


[AAA] did not see it?






A


 
He also saw it, Sir.






 


 






Q


How was he able to see that?






A


He looked at his back, Sir. x x x
[31]
 








  This supports the 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
[32]
 of AAA narrating the incident as follows: 








T


Sa ikaliliwanag ng pagsisiyasat na ito, maaari mo bang isalaysay ang buong pangyayari
? 














S


Ganito po yun maam nagtatambay lang po kami doon sa loob ng court tapos habang nakaupo kami kasama si 
[BBB] 
at
 [CCC] 
tapos po bigla dumating si
 sir SJ 
tapos
 pinagmumura niya kami sabi niya "Tang ina niya nagsigasigaan kayo dito"
 tapos sabi pa niya pag uuntug-untugin ko kayo sa mga tatay niyo at 
natawa po ako kasi inisip ko nagbibiro lang siya tapos tinutukan niya 
ako ng baril tapos sabi gusto mo pusasan daw po ako
.
[33]








Under the circumstances, the RTC convicted San Juan of violation of
 Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610. On appeal, the CA convicted him of the 
crime of grave threats in relation to Republic Act No. 7610, ultimately 
imposing the penalty prescribed for the latter crime.


 We find it proper to fix the nomenclature of the crime committed by San Juan.
  In 
Jumaquio v. Hon. Judge Villarosa
,
[34]
 the accused therein uttered the words "
Putang ina mong bata ka namumuro ka na sa akin, at susunugin ko yung pamilya mo!
"
[35]

 against a minor. He also threw a stone against the said minor, which 
nonetheless missed, and repeatedly punched the minor. He too, uttered 
the words "
Putang ina ninyo, zone leader ako papatayin ko [kayong] lahat!
"
[36]

 against the family members of the said minor. Consequently, two 
Informations were filed against the accused, one for grave threats in 
relation to Republic Act No. 7610 and another, for physical injuries in 
relation to Republic Act No. 7610.
[37]

 The accused thereafter filed a motion to quash the Informations for 
being duplicitous, arguing that he stood charged with several crimes â 
grave threats and violation of Republic Act No. 7610, and physical 
injuries and another violation of the aforesaid law.
[38]

 The trial court denied the motion, which prompted the accused to 
elevate the matter directly before this Court. This Court held that the 
accused disregarded the doctrine of hierarchy of courts and availed the 
wrong remedy. Nonetheless, this Court proceeded to discuss on the 
arguments raised by the accused, holding as follows:
  


 As correctly argued by the City Prosecutor, the questioned 
[I]nformations separately charge two distinct offenses of child abuse[:]
 Criminal Case No. SJC-78-04 for child abuse committed through the use 
of threatening words, and Criminal Case No. SJC-79-04 for child abuse 
through the infliction of physical injuries. Thus, contrary to his 
contention, petitioner is not in jeopardy of being convicted of grave 
threats and child abuse in the first case, and slight physical injuries 
and child abuse in the second. Though the crimes were erroneously 
designated, the averments in the [I]nformations clearly make out an 
offense of child abuse under Section 10(a) of [Republic Act] No. 7610.
[39]




 Significantly, this Court's pronouncement was based on the premise
 that grave threats in relation to R.A. No. 7610 is an erroneous 
designation. Nevertheless, this Court proceeded to examine the contents 
of the Information and held that the same alleged a case for child abuse
 and not grave threats. While the instant case does not present such a 
situation of an erroneous designation in the Information, the CA's 
pronouncement on the crime committed by San Juan deserves a 
re-examination.
 The legal issue that needs to be tackled then, is
 whether San Juan should be held guilty of grave threats or for 
violation of R.A. No. 7610.
 Article 282 of the Revised Penal Code (
RPC
) punishes the crime of grave threats as follows:
  


 Art. 282. 
Grave threats
. â Any person who shall threaten 
another with the infliction upon the person, honor or property of the 
latter or of his family of any wrong amounting to a crime, shall suffer:


 1.	The penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed by law 
for the crime he threatened to commit, if the offender shall have made 
the threat demanding money or imposing any other condition, even though 
not unlawful, and said offender shall have attained his purpose. If the 
offender shall not have attained his purpose, the penalty lower by two 
degrees shall be imposed.


 If the threat be made in writing or through a middleman, the penalty shall be imposed in its maximum period.


 2.	The penalty of 
arresto mayor
 and a fine not exceeding 500 pesos, if the threat shall not have been made subject to a condition.




 On the other hand, Section 10(a), of R.A. No. 7610 provides:
  


 SEC. 10. 
Other Acts of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's Development
. -




 (a)	Any person who shall commit any other acts of child abuse,
 cruelty or exploitation or to be responsible for other conditions 
prejudicial to the child's development including those covered by 
Article 59 of [Presidential Decree] No. 603, as amended, but not covered
 by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall suffer the penalty of [
prision mayor
] in its minimum period.






 The Information
[40]
 
filed against San Juan alleges an act of threatening the life of AAA by 
poking a gun at him, thereby subjecting said minor to psychological 
cruelty and emotional maltreatment. As worded, the Information contains 
an allegation of a threat amounting to a crime committed against a 
child, in which the provisions of grave threats and child abuse under 
Republic Act No. 7610 comes into play. In the resolution of whether San 
Juan should be convicted of the crime of grave threats or violation of 
Republic Act No. 7610, a query was raised during the deliberations of 
this case as to the interpretation of the phrase "
but not covered by the Revised Penal Code, as amended
"
 under Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610. While the phrase may be 
interpreted as a qualifier that would preclude the application of 
Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 when the act complained of is already 
covered by the Revised Penal Code, as in this case, when the act of San 
Juan likewise falls under grave threats, the 
doctrine of last antecedent
 would provide otherwise.
  
 The doctrine was first introduced in our jurisdiction in the Concurring Opinion of Justice Fred Ruiz Castro in 
Philippine Long Distance Telephone v. Public Service Commission
,
[41]
 pertaining to the interpretation of Section 40 (e) of the Public Service Act, as amended, discussing the doctrine in this wise:
  


 Section 40(e) of the Public Service Act, as amended by Republic Act 3792, reads as follows:




	 (e) For annual reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the 
Commission in the supervision of other public services and/or in the 
regulation or fixing of their rates, twenty centavos for each one 
hundred pesos or fraction thereof, of the capital stock subscribed or 
paid, if no shares have been issued, of the capital invested, or of the 
property and equipment, whichever is higher.




 The basic issue is whether the added phrase, "or of the property
 and equipment, whichever is higher," was intended as an alternative 
only to the immediately antecedent phrase, "of the capital invested," or
 also to the previous one, namely "of the capital stock subscribed or 
paid."


 The relevant and pertinent Congressional records do not at all 
provide any indication of the meaning intended by the lawmaking body. 


 The task may, however, be simplified by supplying the words 
which obviously were deliberately omitted and merely indicated by means 
of a comma between the phrase, "or if no shares have been issued," and 
the clause, "of the capital invested, or of the property and equipment, 
whichever is higher." The omitted words thus supplied, the provision 
would read as follows: 




 (e) For annual reimbursement of expenses incurred by the 
Commission in the supervision of other public services and/or in the 
regulation or fixing of their rates, twenty centavos for each one 
hundred pesos or fraction thereof, of the capital stock subscribed or 
paid, or if no shares have been issued, twenty centavos for each one 
hundred pesos or a fraction thereof, of the capital invested, or of the 
property and equipment, whichever is higher. 




 Viewed from this perspective, the meaning of the provision, as 
intended by the lawmaking body, becomes unmistakable, which is, to make 
the alternative basis of computation (property and equipment) applicable
 exclusively to the case or situation to which it obviously relates, 
namely, "if no shares have been issued."


 The rule that a qualifying or relative word or clause, such as 
"which," "said," and "such," is to be construed as applying to the 
words, phrase or clause next preceding or, as is frequently stated, to 
the next preceding antecedent, and not as extending to or including 
others more remote, unless a contrary intention appears (Crawford, Sec. 
193, p 331), may be applied in the present case. This rule is known as 
the doctrine of last antecedent, which is both a rule of grammar and a 
rule of law (Wood vs. Baldwin, 10 N.Y.S. 195).
[42]




 The doctrine later resurfaced, albeit wrongly introduced by the San Juan in the case of 
Mapa v. Arroyo
[43]
 which involved the interpretation of Section 20 of Presidential Decree (
P.D
.) No. 957, 
viz
.:
  


 The specific provisions of the Decree which are persistently relied upon read:




 SEC. 20. Time of Completion. â Every owner or developer shall 
construct and provide the facilities, improvements, infrastructures and 
other forms of development, including water supply and lighting 
facilities, which are offered and indicated in the approved subdivision 
or condominium plans, brochures, prospectus, printed matters, letters or
 in any form of advertisements, within one year from the date of the 
issuance of the license for the subdivision or condominium project or 
such other period of time as may be fixed by the Authority.




 x x x x


 We further reject petitioner's strained and tenuous application 
of the so-called doctrine of last antecedent in the interpretation of 
Section 20 and, correlatively, of Section 21. He would thereby have the 
enumeration of "facilities, improvements, infrastructures and other 
forms of development" interpreted to mean that the demonstrative phrase 
"which are offered and indicated in the approved subdivision plans, 
etc." refer only to "other forms of development" and not to "facilities,
 improvements and infrastructures." While this subserves his purpose, 
such bifurcation, whereby the supposed adjectival phrase is set apart 
from the antecedent words, is illogical and erroneous. The complete and 
applicable rule is [
ad proximum antecedens fiat relatio nisi impediatur sentencia
.]
 Relative words refer to the nearest antecedent, unless it be prevented 
by the context. In the present case, the employment of the word "and" 
between "facilities, improvements, infrastructures" and "other forms of 
development," far from supporting petitioner's theory, enervates it 
instead since it is basic in legal hermeneutics that "and" is not meant 
to separate words but is a conjunction used to denote a joinder or 
union.
[44]
 (Citations omitted)




 The foregoing cases illustrate that qualifying words, clauses or 
phrases refer only to the next preceding antecedent and not to those 
remote ones, unless such interpretation is prevented by the context. 
Applying the doctrine of last antecedent and the rule of 
ad proximum antecedens fiat relatio nisi impediatur sentencia
 (relative words refer to the nearest antecedent, unless it be prevented by the context), We find that the phrase "
but not covered by the Revised Penal Code, as amended
" only qualifies the immediately preceding antecedent phrase "
including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended
"
 under Section 10 (a) of R.A. No. 7610, and not the acts enumerating the
 offense under said provision. To restate, Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 
7610 reads:
  


 Section. 10. 
Other Acts of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Childs Development
.â




 (a)	Any person who shall commit any other acts of child abuse,
 cruelty or exploitation or to be responsible for other conditions 
prejudicial to the child's development 
including those covered by 
Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended, but not covered 
by the Revised Penal Code, as amended
, shall suffer the penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period. (Emphasis supplied)






 The interpretation means that acts punished under Sec. 10(a) of 
R.A. No. 7610 include those acts punishable under Article 59 of P.D. No.
 603, even if not covered by the RPC. Notably, as pointed out by 
Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa, most of the criminal acts 
defined under Article 59 of P.D. No. 603 find counterparts in the RPC.
[45]

 In the case of P.D. No. 603, its provisions apply in case the offenders
 are the child-victim's parents, where "parent" also encompasses "the 
guardian and the head of the institution or foster home which has 
custody of the child." Meanwhile, the RPC applies in case of 
non-parent-offenders, as its provisions did not specify the personality 
of the offender. Since Article 59 of P.D. No. 603 defined certain acts 
which found no counterparts in the RPC [
i.e
., subparagraphs (6), (10), and (11)], no recourse could be had if these acts were committed by a non-parent.

 As such, prior to the enactment of R.A. No. 7610, an act falling under 
Article 59 of P.D. No. 603, when committed by a non-parent, is 
punishable under the appropriate counterpart provision of the RPC. With 
the absence of a counterpart provision under the RPC for paragraphs 6, 
10 and 11 of Article 59 of P.D. No. 603, a significant gap was left in 
the legislation concerning the protection of children. When a non-parent
 commits these acts against a child the same cannot be punished under 
P.D. No. 603 or the RPC. With the advent of R.A. No. 7610, Section 10(a)
 filled this gap, and now punishes acts under Article 59 of P.D. No. 603
 even if committed by a non-parent, including those covered by 
paragraphs 6, 10, and 11 of the latter law. This is evident from the 
linguistic expansion of the term "shall attach to any parent" in Article
 59 of P.D. No. 603, to "any person" in Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610.

 Significantly, the framers of R.A. No. 7610 recognized that the 
enumeration under Article 59 of P.D. No. 603 included acts punishable by
 the RPC and acts that are not punishable thereunder. The provisions of 
R.A. No. 7610 were intended to expand the coverage of Article 59 of P.D.
 No. 603 and the RPC as can be seen from R.A. No. 7610's precursor 
bills, up until its enactment, which suggest a framework that 
implicates, rather than leaves untouched, existing provisions of the 
RPC. The early draft of Section 10(a) was intended to carve out a 
distinct class of offenses that did not fall under either P.D. No. 603 
or the RPC. However, as earlier mentioned, several gaps subsisted under

SEC. 10. Other Acts of Neglect,
 Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the 
Child's Development. - Any person who shall commit any other act of 
neglect, cruelty or exploitation or shall be responsible for conditions 
prejudicial to the development of a child, 
not expressly falling 
under any article of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the provisions 
of the Child and Youth Welfare Code, as amended, or the provisions of 
this Act,
 shall be punished by 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period.

Senator Lina. On page 7, delete
 all the words starting with "of", on line 3 up to the word "Act" on 
line 8, and in lieu thereof, insert the following: OF CHILD ABUSE 
INCLUDING THOSE COVERED BY ARTICLE 59 OF PRESIDENTIAL DECREE 603 AS 
AMENDED BUT NOT COVERED BY THE REVISED PENAL CODE AS AMENDED.
[47]














a) Any person who shall commit 
any other act of child abuse, cruelty or exploitation or be responsible 
for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development including 
those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended, 
but not covered by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall suffer the 
penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period.
[48]
 














Further, as pointed out by Associate Justice Caguioa, Senator Jose 
Lina, who sponsored Senate Bill No. 1209 which later became R.A. No. 
7610, explained that the purpose of introducing Section 10(a) of R.A. 
No. 7610 is to increase the penalties for acts committed against 
children, thus:




 Senator Lina. Yes, in the Child and Youth Welfare Code, Mr. 
President, in Article 59, there is a listing of the particulars of child
 abuse. May I refer the President to enumeration No. 8, "inflicts cruel 
and unusual punishment upon the child or deliberately subjects him to 
indignities and other excessive chastisement that embarrass or humiliate
 him." 


 The President 
Pro Tempore
. That would appear to be 
sufficient. The Chair raised that question because child abuse is 
usually committed by the guardians or the parents themselves. 


 Senator Lina. Yes, the liability attaches to everyone, including the parent, Mr. President. 


 For the information and guidance of our Colleagues, the phase 
"child abuse" here is more descriptive than a definition that specifies 
the particulars of the acts of child abuse. As can be gleaned from the 
bill, Mr. President, there is reference in Section 10 to the "Other Acts
 of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty, or Exploitation and Other Conditions 
Prejudicial to the Child's Development." We refer, for example, to the 
Revised Penal Code. 


 
There are already acts described and punishable under the Revised Penal Code and the Child and Youth Welfare Code.

 These are all enumerated already, Mr. President. There are particular 
acts that are already being punished. But we are providing stronger 
deterrence against child abuse and exploitation 
by increasing the penalties when the victim is a child.
 That is number one. We define a child as "one who is 15 years and below." 


 The President 
Pro Tempore
. Would the Sponsor then say 
that this bill repeals, by implication or as a consequence, the law he 
just cited for the protection of the child as contained in that Code 
just mentioned, since this provides for stronger deterrence against 
child abuse and we have now a Code for the protection of the child? 
Would that Code be now amended by this Act, if passed? 


 Senator Lina. We specified in the bill, Mr. President, increase 
in penalties. That is one. But, of course, that is not everything 
included in the bill. There are other aspects like making it easier to 
prosecute these cases of pedophilia in our country. That is another 
aspect of the bill. The other aspects of the bill include the increase 
in penalties on acts committed against children: and by definition, 
children are those below 15 years of age. So, it is an amendment to the 
Child and Youth Welfare Code, Mr. President. This is not an amendment by
 implication. We made direct reference to the Articles in the Revised 
Penal Code and In the Articles in the Child and Youth Welfare Code that 
are amended because of the increase in the penalties.

Apropos
, the intention of the legislature in introducing 
Section 10 (a) of R.A. No. 7610 is to increase the penalties for acts 
committed against children as enumerated under the P.D. No. 603 and the 
RPC. This signifies the intention of the legislature to bring within the
 ambit of R.A. No. 7610, the provisions of Article 59 of P.D. No. 603 
that are not covered by the RPC, as well as those falling under the RPC.
 Thus, an interpretation of the phrase "
but not covered by the
 [RFC], 
as amended
,"
 that would render the application of R.A. No. 7610 only when the act is
 not covered by the RPC would be contrary to the intention of the 
legislature. To reiterate, said phrase qualifies the antecedent phrase "
including those covered by Article 59 of
 [
P.D
.] 
No. 603, as amended
,"
 and taken as a whole, means that Section 10(a), R.A. No. 7610 applies 
whenever acts of abuse are committed against children under Article 59 
of P.D. No. 603 that are not covered by the RPC. With the word "any 
person" under Section 10(a) and the intention to increase the penalties 
of the punishable acts involving child abuse, Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 
7610 encompasses a wide-ranging act by which the punishable acts under 
Article 59 of P.D. No. 603, whether or not these are covered by the RPC,
 as well as acts under the RPC, involving children may be examined. 
Thus, notwithstanding the allegation of threat to the life of AAA, for 
which grave threats may come in consideration, the act of San Juan must 
be examined under the auspices of R.A. No. 7610, especially that the 
Information alleges psychological harm and cruelty committed against a 
child, which clearly falls under Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610.
  




Section 10 in relation to Section 
3(b): The determination of general or specific intent for prosecution of
 crimes falling under R.A. No. 7610
 






In 
Araneta v. People
[50]
 (
Araneta
), this Court discussed that Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 contemplates four distinct acts, to wit:
  


 As gleaned from the foregoing, 
the provision punishes not only those enumerated under Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, but also four distinct acts, 
i.e
.,
 (a) child abuse, (b) child cruelty, (c) child exploitation and (d) 
being responsible for conditions prejudicial to the  child's 
development. The Rules and Regulations of the questioned statute 
distinctly and separately defined child abuse, cruelty and exploitation 
just to show that these three acts are different from one another and 
from the act prejudicial to the child's development.
 Contrary to 
petitioner's assertion, an accused can be prosecuted and be convicted 
under Section 10 (a), Article VI of Republic Act No. 7610 if he commits 
any of the four acts therein. The prosecution need not prove that the 
acts of child abuse, child cruelty and child exploitation have resulted 
in the prejudice of the child because an act prejudicial to the 
development of the child is different from the former acts. 


 
Moreover, it is a rule in statutory construction that the 
word "or" is a disjunctive term signifying dissociation and independence
 of one thing from other things enumerated. It should, as a rule, be 
construed in the sense which it ordinarily implies. Hence, the use of 
"or" in Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 before the phrase 
"be responsible for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development"

 supposes that there are four punishable acts therein. First, the act of
 child abuse; second, child cruelty; third, child exploitation; and 
fourth, being responsible for conditions prejudicial to the child's 
development.
 The fourth penalized act cannot be interpreted, as 
petitioner suggests, as a qualifying condition for the three other acts,
 because an analysis of the entire context of the questioned provision 
does not warrant such construal.
[51]
 (Emphasis and underline supplied; citations omitted) 




 With respect to the act of child abuse, Section 3(b) of R.A. No. 
7610 offers an enumeration of the acts that may fall therein, thus: 
  


 x x x x


 (b) "Child Abuse" refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child which includes any of the following: 




 (1)	Psychological and physical abuse, neglect, cruelty, sexual abuse and emotional maltreatment; 


 (2)	Any act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being; 


 (3)	Unreasonable deprivation of his basic needs for survival, such as food and shelter; or


 (4)	Failure to immediately give medical treatment to an 
injured child resulting in serious impairment of his growth and 
development or in his permanent incapacity or death. 






 The aforementioned enumeration	covers different acts committed 
against children. Section 3(b)(1) focuses on the act and the general 
criminal intent to commit the physical or psychological abuse, while 
Section 3(b)(2), which, in addition to general criminal intent, requires
 specific criminal intent to debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic 
worth of the child as a human being. The distinction primarily flows 
from the difference in language, wherein Section 3(b)(1) articulates 
specific acts falling thereunder (
i.e
., "neglect," "abuse," 
"cruelty," etc.), while Section 3(b)(2) is directed against "any act by 
deeds or words," which expansive language must be delimited by the 
qualifier "which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and 
dignity of a child as a human being." 
 As defined, debasement is 
the act of reducing the value, quality, or purity of something; 
degradation, on the other hand, is a lessening of a person's or thing's 
character or quality; while to demean means to lower in status, 
condition, reputation, or character.
[52]
 For acts falling under Section 3(b)(2), both the general criminal intent and specific criminal intent must be proven. 

 Other acts falling under Section 3(b) include unreasonable deprivation 
of a child's basic needs for survival such as food and shelter, and 
failure to immediately give medical treatment to an injured child 
resulting in serious impairment of his/her growth and development or in 
his/her permanent incapacity or death. 
 In a number of cases,
[53]

 this Court examined violations of Section 10(a) within the prism of the
 enumeration provided by Section 3(b) of R.A. No. 7610. Section 3(b) 
however, has its own nuances as Section 3(b)(2) provides an additional 
requirement of a specific intent when compared to Sections 3(b)(1), (3) 
and (4).
  As distinguished, specific criminal intent must be 
alleged
 and 
proved

 by the prosecution, and must be established by the prosecution as a 
fact, while general criminal intent is presumed from the criminal act.
[54]

 It is a general rule that if it is proved that the accused committed 
the unlawful act charged, it will be presumed that the act was done with
 a criminal intention, and that it is for the accused to rebut this 
presumption. However, there are certain crimes of which a specific 
intent to accomplish a particular purpose is an essential element.
[55]

 This specific intent was taken into consideration by this Court in the 
analysis of crimes involving violation of Section 3(b)(2) of R.A. No. 
7610. 
 In 
Bongalon v. People
,
[56]

 the accused was charged with violation of Section 10 (a) of R.A. No. 
7610 because he slapped a minor on his face, after said child threw 
stones at his minor daughter. This Court convicted him of slight 
physical injuries, as there was no showing that slapping the minor was 
accompanied by intent to debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth 
and dignity of the child, thus:
  


 Although [W]e affirm the factual findings of fact by the RTC and
 the CA to the effect that the petitioner struck Jayson at the back with
 his hand and slapped Jayson on the face, we disagree with their holding
 that his acts constituted 
child abuse
 within the purview of the 
above-quoted provisions. The records did not establish beyond reasonable
 doubt that his laying of hands on Jayson had been intended to debase 
the "intrinsic worth and dignity" of Jayson as a human being, or that he
 had thereby intended to humiliate or embarrass Jayson. The records 
showed the laying of hands on Jayson to have been done at the spur of 
the moment and in anger, indicative of his being then overwhelmed by his
 fatherly concern for the personal safety of his own minor daughters who
 had just suffered harm at the hands of Jayson and Roldan. With the loss
 of his self-control, he lacked that specific intent to debase, degrade 
or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being 
that was so essential in the crime of 
child abuse
.
[57]




 In 
Talocod v. People
,
[58]

 the accused therein was acquitted of the charge for violation of 
Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 as there was no indication that when she 
uttered the phrase, "
Huwag mong pansinin yan. At putang ina yan. Mga walang kwenta yan. Mana-mana lang yan!
"
 she had deliberately intended to shame or humiliate AAA's dignity in 
front of his playmates. Rather, it was apparent that she merely voiced 
the alleged utterances as offhand remarks out of parental concern for 
her child. Thus, there was no specific intent to debase, degrade, or 
demean the victim's intrinsic worth and dignity of the child. To be 
clear, it is not merely the presence or absence of a specific intent to 
debase, degrade, and demean the child which determines whether an act 
would fall under Republic Act No. 7610. This Court clarified in 
Malcampo-Repollo v. People
[59]
 that not all crimes punishable under R.A. No. 7610 requires proof of such specific intent:
  


 The act of debasing, degrading, or demeaning the child's 
intrinsic worth and dignity as a human being has been characterized as a
 specific intent in some forms of child abuse. The specific intent 
becomes relevant in child abuse when: (1) it is required by a specific 
provision in Republic Act No. 7610, as for instance, in lascivious 
conduct; or (2) when the act is described in the [I]nformation as one 
that debases, degrades, or demeans the child's intrinsic worth and 
dignity as a human being.
[60]
 (Citations omitted)




 Thus, it is only when the Information alleges a specific intent, 
or when the provision of law demands it, must the prosecution prove its 
existence.
[61]
 Specific intent
 becomes significant for determining the specific provisionâwhether 
under the RPC, under R.A. No. 7610, or even other criminal lawsâunder 
which an act will be punished. As such, where the specific intent is not
 proven under a provision of law, the act may still be punished under 
other applicable penal laws provided that the elements of the crime has 
been satisfied. It is only when both general and specific intent are not
 proven that an accused is entitled to acquittal. 
  
 It bears reiterating that the objective of enacting R.A. No. 
7610 was primarily to increase the penalty for acts committed against 
children. It is intended to protect children and serve as a deterrence 
against abuses committed against them. As such, when the act is wrong in
 itself, it is not the specific intent to degrade, debase, or demean the
 intrinsic worth and dignity of the child under Section 3(b)(2) of R.A. 
No. 7610 that must be considered. Rather, the act itself must be 
examined under Section 3(b)(1) of R.A. No. 7610. 
  




The act of San Juan falls under Section 10(a) in relation to Section 3(b)(1) of R.A. No. 7610
 






In the case at bar, the Information charges San Juan with violation
 of R.A. No. 7610, alleging "psychological cruelty and emotional 
maltreatment." While the term "psychological cruelty" is absent from 
among the enumeration under R.A. No. 7610, the allegations in the 
Information nonetheless informed San Juan of what he was being charged 
with. San Juan was not made unaware that what is involved is an act of 
psychological abuse and an act of cruelty. 
  
 Under the Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 7610 "cruelty" has
 been defined in the same manner as the punishable act under Section 
3(b)(2) of R.A. No. 7610. Section 2(c) of the Rules and Regulations on 
the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases defines cruelty as 
follows: 
  


 (c) "Cruelty" refers to any act by word or deed which debases, 
degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a 
human being. Discipline administered by a parent or legal guardian to a 
child does not constitute cruelty provided it is reasonable in manner 
and moderate in degree and does not constitute physical or psychological
 injury as defined herein[.]




  The Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 7610 nonetheless failed to 
consider that the term "cruelty" appears under Section 3(b)(1) and not 
under Section 3(b)(2) of R.A. No. 7610. As worded, Section 3(b)(1) of 
R.A. No. 7610 reads: 
  


 
Sec. 3. Definition of Terms.
 -


 x x x x


 (b) "Child 
abuse
" refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child which includes any of the following: 




 (1) Psychological and physical abuse, neglect, 
cruelty
, sexual abuse and emotional maltreatment[.] (Emphasis supplied) 






 The term cruelty, in its common usage, has been defined as the 
intentional and malicious infliction of physical suffering upon living 
creatures, particularly human beings; or, as applied to the latter, the 
wanton, malicious, and unnecessary infliction of pain upon the body, or 
the feelings and emotions; abusive treatment; inhumanity; outrage.
[62]

 Under the RPC, cruelty is included as one of the aggravating 
circumstances. It presupposes that the injury caused be deliberately 
increased by causing other wrong and that other wrong be unnecessary for
 the execution of the purpose of the offender.
[63]

  Certainly, the term cruelty, in its common usage, simply means 
suffering that is excessive and unnecessary to the purpose to be 
achieved by an offender. An act that is accompanied by such a cruel act 
can easily be determined by the manner it was executed. It does not need
 an inquiry into the specific intent to debase, degrade or demean the 
intrinsic worth and dignity of the child, as being referred to under the
 Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 7610. 
 As such, while cruelty 
has been given a definition under the Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 
7610, such term cannot be confined therein especially that Section 
3(b)(1) includes cruelty among its enumeration, that is separate from 
Section 3(b)(2). 
 To avoid confusion, child cruelty, when 
referring to Section 3(b)(2) of R.A. No. 7610 must thus always carry the
 qualification that the act complained of, debased, degrade or demeaned 
the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child. Otherwise, the same may be
 used in its common usage, which is the definition being applied in the 
instant case. 
 To illustrate, the use of the term "cruel" in its 
common usage, and not as used under the Rules and Regulations of R.A. 
No. 7610, was applied in 
Lucido v. People
,
[64]
 by making the following pronouncement:
  


 Strangulating, severely pinching, and beating an eight (8)-year-old child to cause her to limp are 
intrinsically cruel

 and excessive. These acts of abuse impair the child's dignity and worth
 as a human being and infringe upon her right to grow up in a safe, 
wholesome, and harmonious place. It is not difficult to perceive that 
this experience of repeated physical abuse from petitioner would 
prejudice the child's social, moral, and emotional development. 


 x x x x


 Hence, 
the 
intent to debase, degrade, or demean
 the minor is not the defining mark.
 Any act of punishment that debases, degrades, and demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child constitutes the offense.
[65]
 (Emphases and underline supplied) 




 Unlike in cases where the surrounding circumstances of the act 
were examined to determine the specific intent to degrade, debase or 
demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child, an act that is 
intrinsically cruel may already be examined based on Section 3(b)(1) of 
Republic Act No. 7610. When the act itself is examined based on the 
inherent characteristic of the act itself and the manner of its 
execution, and it later turns out to be intrinsically cruel, there 
should be no need to look into the specific intent. Again, the term 
cruelty, when not qualified by the terms "to debase, degrade or demean 
the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child," may still be utilized 
based on its common usage. 
 Herein, the Information filed against
 San Juan does not carry the qualifying allegations of "debased, degrade
 or demeaned the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child." To analyze 
the Information based on the definition of the Rules and Regulations of 
Republic Act No. 7610 alone would require this Court to look into the 
requirement of specific intent because of the allegation of "cruelty." 
However, such a step would result in requiring the prosecution to prove 
more than what has been alleged in the Information. Moreso, this 
additional requirement would be based on an Implementing Rules and 
Regulations that failed to make a differentiation based on the 
provisions of the law it seeks to implement. The term "cruelty" as found
 in Section 3(b)(1) of Republic Act No. 7610, and not under Section 
3(b)(2), cannot be automatically associated with the latter provision, 
which requires an additional requirement of proof of specific intent, 
especially when it does not contain the material allegations of 
"debased, degrade or demeaned the intrinsic worth and dignity of the 
child." 
 This must be so for it is settled that both the accused 
and the State are entitled to due process. For the former, such right 
includes the right to present evidence for his or her defense; for the 
latter, such right pertains to a fair opportunity to prosecute and 
convict.
[66]
 As the State 
sought the prosecution of San Juan in an Information that did not allege
 debasing, degrading or demeaning the intrinsic worth and dignity of a 
child, it cannot be required to prove such a specific intent, especially
 when the averments in the Information is supported by another provision
 of R.A. No. 7610 that do not require such a specific intent. To do 
otherwise would be tantamount to a violation of the State's right to due
 process. 
 As such, the allegation of cruelty in the Information filed against San Juan must be analyzed based on its common usage. 

 In this case, pointing a firearm towards a minor is intrinsically 
cruel. Due to the nature of a firearm, R.A. No. 10591 regulates the 
ownership, possession, carrying, manufacture, dealing in and importation
 of firearms, ammunition, or parts thereof.
[67]

 R.A. No. 10591 was enacted to maintain peace and order and protect the 
people against violence. It also recognizes the right of qualified 
citizens to self-defense through, when it is the reasonable means to 
repel the unlawful aggression under the circumstances, the use of 
firearms.
[68]
 For the members 
of the Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines and 
law enforcement agents, mere displaying of a firearm, when not used for a
 legitimate purpose, is even prohibited.
[69]

 Such is understandable for in the normal course of things, a gun, when 
displayed, moreso, when pointed towards another, regardless of age, 
instantly generates fear.
  It bears emphasis that the object 
involved in this case is a gun. Unlike other objects that may be used to
 hurt a child, a gun serves no other purpose than to cause injury or 
death. In the hands of a person with ill-motive, the objective to injure
 or kill could be achieved; in the hands of a person with good 
intention, the objective to repel an unlawful aggression may be 
accomplished. In these cases, one has to cause injury in order to 
achieve either objective. 
  
Certainly, when there is nothing to defend against, any 
preparatory act of using a gun, as by pointing it towards a minor, would
 only cause fear in the mind of that person. With the only remaining act
 of pulling the trigger of a gun, it is the near possibility of the 
resulting death or injury that will remain etched in the mind of the 
minor. There is no denying that psychological harm immediately results 
therefrom, which falls as psychological abuse, as Section 3(b) of R.A. 
No. 7610 classifies maltreatment as child abuse based on the act 
committed, whether it be habitual or not. 
  
 Militating against San Juan is his training as a police 
officer, whose duty is to uphold the law and to protect the well-being 
of the citizens of the community. Woefully, San Juan did the exact 
opposite. The use of his service firearm against a hapless 15-year old 
minor, when he could have used other means to prevent AAA and his 
friends from playing basketball during such time, is manifestly 
excessive and unnecessary to achieve his purpose. 
 It is not 
farfetched to assume that children, recognized as the most vulnerable 
members of society, can offer no resistance against an armed officer and
 in all likelihood, would be scarred by trauma long after the incident. A
 gun, when used to threaten an individual, moreso a minor, would 
undoubtedly create a lasting fear that could persist throughout the 
minor's life; worse, such an incident could further erode and even 
endanger the minor's psychological state and normal development. 
Ineluctably, the use of such firearm in such manner as in this case 
inherently carries with it a malicious intent to which San Juan must be 
held answerable for. As such, San Juan must be held liable for violation
 of Section 10(a) in relation to Section 3(b)(1) of R.A. No. 7610.
 With respect to the imposable penalty, Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 prescribes the penalty of 
prision mayor

 in its minimum period, which has a period of six (6) years and one (1) 
day to eight (8) years. In the absence of any mitigating or aggravating 
circumstance, the maximum penalty to be imposed upon San Juan shall be 
taken from the medium period of the imposable penalty, which has a range
 of six (6) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to seven (7) years 
and four (4) months. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the 
minimum penalty to be imposed shall be taken one degree lower from the 
imposable penalty, which is 
prision correccional
 maximum, with a 
range of four (4) years two (2) months and one (1) day to six (6) years.
 Considering the prevailing circumstances, this Court deems it proper to
 impose the penalty of four (4) years, nine (9) months and eleven (11) 
days as minimum, to seven (7) years and four (4) months, as maximum term
 of imprisonment.
 As to the damages, this Court affirms the CA 
ruling that San Juan should be liable to pay AAA the amount of 
P20,000.00 as moral damages on account of the psychological abuse and 
cruelty he suffered. Further, in order to serve as an example for the 
correction of the public good,
[70]

 this Court likewise affirms the award of P20,000.00 as exemplary 
damages. These civil liabilities shall earn interest at the rate of six 
(6%) percent per annum from the finality of judgment until full payment.

CONCURRING OPINION


 
LEONEN, 
SAJ.
:
 I concur in the result that 
petitioner Marvin L. San Juan (San Juan) should be convicted of 
violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610. I contribute for 
the consideration of the 
ponente
 the following observations.
 
I


 An Information was filed against petitioner charging him with 
subjecting AAA to "psychological cruelty and emotional maltreatment."
[1]
 The Information reads:
  


 That on or about March 26, 2014, in Valenzuela City and within 
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who 
was drunk, without and justifiable cause, did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously threaten of life of one [AAA] 15 years old 
(DOB: May 5, 1998) (complainant) by poking a gun at him, an act 
amounting to a crime, thereby subjecting said minor to psychological 
cruelty and emotional maltreatment.


 CONTRARY TO LAW.




  After trial, the Regional Trial Court convicted San Juan of child abuse under Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610.
[2]
 The Court of Appeals sustained San Juan's conviction but modified the designation of the offense as grave threats
[3]
 in relation to Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610.
[4]
 The 
ponencia
,
 while affirming petitioner's conviction, deleted the correlation to 
grave threats and convicted him of violation of Section 10(a) in 
relation to Section 3(b)(1) of Republic Act No. 7610.
[5]
 In ruling this, the 
ponencia

 considered the interplay between the provisions of Republic Act No. 
7610, Presidential Decree No. 603, and the Revised Penal Code. It also 
took into account the legislature's intent in enacting Republic Act No. 
7610.
[6]
  It observed 
that while most of the punishable acts under Article 59 of Presidential 
Decree No. 603 had a counterpart provision in the Revised Penal Code, 
paragraphs 6, 10 and 11 of Article 59 had no equivalent rule under the 
Revised Penal Code, and thus "no recourse could be had if these acts 
were committed by a non-parent."
[7]
 It then presented a comparative table
[8]
 of the corresponding offenses punished under Presidential Decree No. 603 and the Revised Penal Code:
  








[Presidential Decree] No. 603, Article 59










Possible [Revised Penal Code] Counterpart

(11) Allows or requires the child to

belongs to the parent, it shall be presumed that he permitted or ordered
 the child to drive. . . 










None. 










While I admire the 
ponencia
's effort to harmonize 
Presidential Decree No. 603 and the Revised Penal Code, I believe that 
the acts punished under paragraph 8, Article 59 of Presidential Decree 
No. 603 are not on all fours with that of Articles 263, 265, 266, and 
358 of the Revised Penal Code. For reference, paragraph 8 of Article 59 
reads:




 ART. 59. Crimes. - Criminal liability shall attach to any parent who:


 . . . .


 (8)	Inflicts cruel and unusual punishment upon the child or 
deliberately subjects him to indignitions and other excessive 
chastisement that embarrass or humiliate him.




  Meanwhile, Articles 263, 265, 266, and 358 of the Revised Penal Code provide:
  


 ARTICLE 263. Serious physical injuries. - Any person who shall 
wound, beat, or assault another, shall be guilty of the crime of serious
 physical injuries and shall suffer:




  1.	The penalty of 
prision mayor
, if in consequence of the physical injuries inflicted, the injured person shall become insane, imbecile, impotent, or blind;


 2.	The penalty of 
prision correccional
 in its medium 
and maximum periods, if in consequence of the physical injuries 
inflicted, the person injured shall have lost the use of speech or the 
power to hear or to smell, or shall have lost an eye, a hand, a foot, an
 arm, or a leg or shall have lost the use of any such member, or shall 
have become incapacitated for the work in which he was therefor 
habitually engaged; 


 3.	The penalty of 
prision correccional
 in its minimum 
and medium periods, if in consequence of the physical injuries 
inflicted, the person injured shall have become deformed, or shall have 
lost any other part of his body, or shall have lost the use thereof, or 
shall have been ill or incapacitated for the performance of the work in 
which he as habitually engaged for a period of more than ninety days; 


 4.	The penalty of 
arresto mayor
 in its maximum period to 
prision correccional

 in its minimum period, if the physical injuries inflicted shall have 
caused the illness or incapacity for labor of the injured person for 
more than thirty days. 


 If the offense shall have been committed against any of the 
persons enumerated in Article 246, or with attendance of any of the 
circumstances mentioned in Article 248, the case covered by subdivision 
number 1 of this Article shall be punished by 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium and maximum periods; the case covered by subdivision number 2 by 
prision correccional
 in its maximum period to 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period; the case covered by subdivision number 3 by 
prision correccional
 in its medium and maximum periods; and the case covered by subdivision number 4 by 
prision correccional
 in its minimum and medium periods. 


 The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not be 
applicable to a parent who shall inflict physical injuries upon his 
child by excessive chastisement. 


 Article 265. Less serious physical injuries. - Any person who 
shall inflict upon another physical injuries not described in the 
preceding articles, but which shall incapacitate the offended party for 
labor for ten days or more, or shall require medical assistance for the 
same period, shall be guilty of less serious physical injuries and shall
 suffer the penalty of 
arresto mayor
. 


 Whenever less serious physical injuries shall have been 
inflicted with the manifest intent to kill or offend the injured person,
 or under circumstances adding ignominy to the offense in addition to 
the penalty of 
arresto mayor
, a fine not exceeding 500 pesos shall be imposed. 


 Any less serious physical injuries inflicted upon the 
offender's parents, ascendants, guardians, curators, teachers, or 
persons of rank, or persons in authority, shall be punished by 
prision correccional

 in its minimum and medium periods, provided that, in the case of 
persons in authority, the deed does not constitute the crime of assault 
upon such person. 




 Article 266. Slight physical injuries and maltreatment. - The crime of slight physical injuries shall be punished: 




  1.	By 
arresto menor
 when the offender has inflicted 
physical injuries which shall incapacitate the offended party for labor 
from one to nine days, or shall require medical attendance during the 
same period. 


 2.	By 
arresto menor
 or a fine not exceeding 20 pesos 
and censure when the offender has caused physical injuries which do not 
prevent the offended party from engaging in his habitual work nor 
require medical assistance. 


 3.	By 
arresto menor
 in its minimum period or a fine not
 exceeding 50 pesos when the offender shall ill-treat another by deed 
without causing any injury. 


 Article 358. Slander. - Oral defamation shall be punished by 
arresto mayor
 in its maximum period to 
prision correccional
 in its minimum period if it is of a serious and insulting nature; otherwise the penalty shall be 
arresto menor
 or a fine not exceeding 200 pesos. 






 A perusal of these provisions reveals that while Article 59 (8) is
 couched in general terms, in that it may include the beating, 
assaulting, and oral defamation of a child, Article 59 (8) requires the 
additional element of embarrassment or humiliation. The infliction of 
cruel or unusual punishment upon a child must have resulted in the 
child's embarrassment or humiliation. Yet, an individual prosecuted for 
violation of Articles 263, 265, 266, and 358 of the Revised Penal Code 
may be convicted regardless of the effect of his or her act upon the 
child victim. 
 In the same way, it is my view that Article 59 (9) cannot be equated to Article 340 of the Revised Penal Code. 

 On one hand, Article 59 (9) imposes criminal liability upon a parent 
who "[c]auses or encourages. . . [his or her] child to lead an immoral 
or dissolute life[.]"
 On the other hand, Article 340 penalizes 
"[a]ny person who shall promote or facilitate the prostitution or 
corruption of persons underage to satisfy the lust of another[.]" 
  
Immorality pertains to conduct that "is 
willful, flagrant, or shameless, and which shows a moral indifference to
 the opinion of the good and respectable members of the community[.]"
[9]

 While this definition may include the acts punished under Article 340 
of the Revised Penal Code, immoral conduct is not limited to 
prostitution of children. 
  
 Accordingly, I submit that the acts punished under Article 59,
 paragraphs 8 and 9 cannot be interpreted to equate to Articles 263, 
265, 266, 358, and 340 of the Revised Penal Code. 
 
II
 I concur with the 
ponencia
 that San Juan is guilty of violating Section 10(a) in relation to Section 3(b)(1) of Republic Act No. 7610.

 Republic Act No. 7610 is a legislation enacted to advance the State's 
policy of affording children special protection against "all forms of 
abuse, neglect, cruelty exploitation and discrimination and other 
conditions, prejudicial their development[.]"
[10]
  In line with this, the law enumerates certain prohibited acts which include child prostitution
[11]
 and child trafficking,
[12]

 among others. In addition, Section 10 of Republic Act No. 7610 outlines
 the acts which are characterized as other acts of abuse. Section 10(a) 
provides:



 SECTION 10. Other Acts of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation 
and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's Development. -






(a)


Any person who shall commit
 any other acts of child abuse, cruelty or exploitation or to be 
responsible for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development 
including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as
 amended, but not covered by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall 
suffer the penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period.








Among the acts punished under Section 10(a) is child abuse, the definition of which is provided in Section 3(b) of the same law:








(b)


"Child abuse" refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child which includes any of the following:






 


 


 










(1) Psychological and physical abuse, neglect, cruelty, sexual abuse and emotional maltreatment;






 


 


 










(2) Any act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being; 






 


 


 










(3) Unreasonable deprivation of his basic needs for survival, such as food and shelter; or






 


 


 










(4) Failure to immediately give medical
 treatment to an injured child resulting in serious impairment of his 
growth and development or in his permanent incapacity or death. 








In 
Malcampo-Repollo v. People
,
[13]
 this Court, citing 
Lucido v. People
,
[14]
 characterized violations of Republic Act No. 7610 as 
malum prohibitum
, for which "no malice or intent to commit a crime need be proved."
[15]
 It held:




 Child abuse, as penalized under Republic Act No. 7610, is 
malum prohibitum
, where intent is not the defining mark in the offense: 




 Republic Act No. 7610 is a measure geared to provide a strong 
deterrence against child abuse and exploitation and to give a special 
protection to children from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, 
exploitation, and other conditions prejudicial to their development. It 
must be stressed that the crime under Republic Act No. 7610 is 
malum prohibitum
.
 Hence, the intent to debase, degrade, or demean the minor is not the 
defining mark. Any act of punishment that debases, degrades, and demeans
 the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child constitutes the offense. 




 In other words, intent is not an indispensable element to 
sustain all convictions under Section 10 (a) of Republic Act No. 7610. 
Generally, in 
mala prohibita
, the defense of lack of criminal 
intent is irrelevant. As long as all the elements of the offense have 
been established beyond reasonable doubt, conviction ensues.
[16]




 Yet, 
Malcampo-Repollo
 clarified that in some forms of child
 abuse, the prosecution must also prove the existence of the specific 
intent to debase, degrade, or demean the child's intrinsic worth and 
dignity as a human being: 
  


The act of debasing, degrading, or demeaning the child's 
intrinsic worth and dignity as a human being has been characterized as a
 specific intent in some forms of child abuse. The specific intent 
becomes relevant in child abuse when: (1) it is required by a specific 
provision in Republic Act No. 7610, as for instance, in lascivious 
conduct; or (2) when the act is described in the information as one that
 debases, degrades, or demeans the child's intrinsic worth and dignity 
as a human being.
[17]




 It is the factual allegations in the information that determine 
whether there is a need to establish the specific intent to debase, 
degrade, or demean. "If the form of child abuse alleged requires 
specific intent as defined by law, the prosecution is required to prove 
it. If the information does not allege the specific intent, or if it is 
not required by law, it need not be established."
[18]
 I agree with the 
ponencia

 that the facts, as alleged in the Information, do not require the 
prosecution to establish the specific intent to debase, degrade, or 
demean.
[19]
 The acts of 
petitioner, as described in the Information, constitute child abuse 
under Section 3(b)(1) of Republic Act No. 7610. Crimes of this nature 
are inherently cruel for which intent of the offender is immaterial.

 Abusing a child is always an intrinsically cruel act. Regardless of 
one's intent, acts constituting child abuse have the effect of impairing
 "the child's dignity and worth as a human being and infringe upon [his 
or her] right to grow up in a safe, wholesome, and harmonious place."
[20]

 It is human instinct which holds us accountable to rear a child in a 
hospitable, secure, and abundant environment. Away from maltreatment, 
obscenities, and deprivation, a child has a better chance of growing 
into a well-rounded adult. The effect of abuse is not always apparent. 
Scars and trauma are not always visible.

DISSENTING OPINION




 
CAGUIOA, 
J
.:


 From the various observations, analyses, and suggestions 
introduced by my esteemed colleagues, as well as the revisions undergone
 by the 
ponencia
, I offer my humble comments through this 
Dissenting Opinion on the proper understanding of what acts are meant to
 be punished under Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. (RA) 7610.
[1]


 The 
ponencia
 discusses: (a) the meaning of the clause 
"but not covered by the Revised Penal Code [(RPC)]" in Section 10(a) of 
RA 7610; and (b) the difference between child abuse as defined in 
Section 3(b)(1) and Section 3(b)(2) of the same law.

 Section 10(a) of RA 7610 states:



 Section 10. 
Other Acts of Neglect; Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's Development
. -
  




 (a) Any person who shall commit any other acts of child abuse, 
cruelty or exploitation or be responsible for other conditions 
prejudicial to the child's development including those covered by 
Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended, but not covered 
by the [RPC], as amended, shall suffer the penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period. 
      










On the meaning of the clause "but not covered by the [RPC]"
 






The 
ponencia
 explains that the clause "but not covered by the 
[RPC]" is meant to modify only the immediately preceding clause 
"including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. [(PD)]
 603,
[2]
 as amended." Considering the intent of the legislature to increase penalties, the 
ponencia
 interprets these two adjacent clauses to mean that acts which were previously enumerated under Article 59
[3]

 of PD 603, but do not have any counterpart in the RPC, should be deemed
 punished under Section 10(a) of RA 7610. As to what these acts are, the
 
ponencia
 explains:




 The interpretation means that acts punished under Sec. 10(a) of 
[RA] 7610 include those acts punishable under Article 59 of [PD] 603, 
even if not covered by the [RPC]. Notably, as pointed out by Associate 
Justice Alfredo Benjamin Caguioa, most of the criminal acts defined 
under Article 59 of [PD] 603 find counterparts in the [RPC]. In the case
 of [PD] 603, its provisions apply in case the offenders are the 
child-victim's parents, where "parent" also encompasses "the guardian 
and the head of the institution or foster home which has custody of the 
child." Meanwhile, the RPC applies in case of non-parent-offenders, as 
its provisions did not specify the personality of the offender. Since 
Article 59 of [PD] 603 defined certain acts which found no counterparts 
in the RPC [
i.e
., subparagraphs (6), (10), and (11)], no recourse could be had if these acts were committed by a nonÂ­ parent.
[4]






 Hence, based on the 
ponencia
, the clause "including those 
covered by Article 59 of [PD] 603, as amended, but not covered by the 
[RPC], as amended," refers to paragraphs 6, 10, and 11 of Article 59 of 
PD 603 as committed by non-parents, since these would not have been 
covered by either PD 603 or the RPC prior to the enactment of RA 7610. 
The 
ponencia
 further explains that by making "any person" a 
possible offender under Section 10(a), this section also now punishes 
the acts enumerated under Article 59 of PD 603, even as they are acts 
committed by parents: 



 x x x With the word "any person" under Section 10(a) and the 
intention to increase the penalties of the punishable acts involving 
child abuse, Section 10(a) of [RA] 7610 encompasses a wide-ranging act 
by which the punishable acts under Article 59 of [PD] 603, whether or 
not these are covered by the RPC, as well as acts under the RPC, 
involving children may be examined. x x x
[5]






 I agree with the 
ponencia
's interpretation as discussed. 
Notably also, punishing the acts enumerated in Article 59 of PD 603 
under Section 10(a) of RA 7610 is supported by Article 60 of PD 603, 
which states:



 ART. 60. 
Penalty
. â The act[s] mentioned in the preceding 
article [(referring to Article 59)] shall be punishable with 
imprisonment from two to six months or a fine not exceeding five hundred
 pesos, or both, at the discretion of the Court, unless a higher penalty
 is provided for in the [RPC] or special laws, without prejudice to 
actions for the involuntary commitment of the child under Title VIII of 
this Code.
  




 The penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period (six years
 and one day to eight years) is undeniably higher than the two to six 
months of imprisonment or a fine imposed by Article 60 of PD 603.

 As the foregoing discussion has already established that the 
acts punished under Article 59 of PD 603 should be punished under 
Section 10(a), the only remaining question is 
under which law should 
an offender be prosecuted and convicted if his/her acts can fall in 
either or both the RPC or Section 10(a) of RA 7610
.





The distinctions between Section 3(b)(1) and Section 3(b)(2) of RA 7610
 






Section 3(b) in its entirety states:




 (b) "Child abuse" refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child which includes any of the following:
  








(1)


Psychological and physical abuse, neglect, cruelty, sexual abuse and emotional maltreatment;






(2)


 
Any act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being;






(3)


Unreasonable deprivation of his basic needs for survival, such as food and shelter; or






(4)


Failure to immediately give medical 
treatment to an injured child resulting in serious impairment of his 
growth and development or in his permanent incapacity or death. 










The 
ponencia
 points out that the acts described in Section 
3(b)(1), 3(b)(3), and 3(b)(4), in contrast to the acts described in 
3(b)(2), require only proof of general criminal intent, which is 
ordinarily presumed from the commission of the criminal act.
[6]
 It is for the accused to rebut this presumption.
[7]

 On the other hand, Section 3(b)(2) additionally requires that the 
prosecution prove the existence of the specific intent to debase, 
degrade, or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human
 being, as an essential element of the crime.
[8]


 In applying these principles to the case at hand, the 
ponencia
 begins by examining the Information filed against petitioner Marvin L. San Juan (San Juan): 



 That on or about March 26, 2014, in 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

 and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, who was drunk, without any justifiable cause, did then and 
there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously threaten the life of one 
AAA,
[9]
 15 years old (DOB: May
 5, 1998) (complainant) by poking a gun at him, an act amounting to a 
crime, thereby subjecting said minor to psychological cruelty and 
emotional maltreatment.
  


 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[10]






 The 
ponencia
 notes that aside from narrating the act of 
threatening the life of the minor by poking a gun at him, the 
Information also alleges that San Juan subjected the minor to 
"psychological cruelty and emotional maltreatment." Given these 
allegations in the Information, the 
ponencia
 concludes that what is being described is an act of "psychological abuse and an act of cruelty."
[11]
 "Psychological abuse" is among the acts enumerated in Section 3(b)(1) of RA 7610. As far as "cruelty" is concerned, the 
ponencia
 observes that there may be two ways of understanding the same.

 First is the definition of "cruelty" in Section 2(c) of the 
Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse 
Cases (Rules on Child Abuse Cases), as follows: 



 (c) "Cruelty" refers to any act by word or deed which debases, 
degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a 
human being. Discipline administered by a parent or legal guardian to a 
child does not constitute cruelty provided it is reasonable in manner 
and moderate in degree and does not constitute physical or psychological
 injury as defined herein[.]
  




 The above definition evidently references the phrase "debases, 
degrades, or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child." This, 
as already mentioned, is a clause that appears in Section 3(b)(2) and 
not in 3(b)(1). This then conflicts with characterizing the alleged acts
 as "psychological abuse" under Section 3(b)(1). Furthermore, "cruelty" 
itself appears in the enumeration in Section 3(b)(1) alongside 
"psychological and physical abuse," among other acts. To remedy this, 
the 
ponencia
 looks to the ordinary meaning of "cruelty":



 Certainly, the term cruelty, in its common usage, simply means 
suffering that is excessive and unnecessary to the purpose to be 
achieved by an offender. An act that is accompanied by such a cruel act 
can easily be determined by the manner it was executed. It does not need
 an inquiry into the specific intent to debase, degrade or demean the 
intrinsic worth and dignity of the child, as being referred to under the
 Rules and Regulations of [RA] 7610. 
  


 As such, while cruelty has been given a definition under the Rules
 and Regulations of [RA] 7610, such term cannot be confined therein 
especially that Section 3(b)(1) includes cruelty among its enumeration, 
that is separate from Section 3(b)(2). 
  


 To avoid confusion, child cruelty, when referring to Section 
3(b)(2) of [RA] 7610 must thus always carry the qualification that the 
act complained of, debased, degrade[d] or demeaned the intrinsic worth 
and dignity of the child. Otherwise, the same may be used in its common 
usage, which is the definition being applied in the instant case.
[12]






 The 
ponencia
 then borrows the term "intrinsically cruel" from the case of 
Lucido v. People
[13]
 (
Lucido
)
 to distinguish between what might be considered "cruelty" under Section
 3(b)(1) and "cruelty" as defined in the Rules on Child Abuse Cases. 
According to the 
ponencia
, if the act involved is inherently cruel (such as in 
Lucido
,
 where the accused severely pinched and beat an 8-year-old child, 
causing her to limp) there is no need to establish the existence of the 
specific intent to debase, degrade, or demean the intrinsic worth or 
dignity of the child as a human being. 

 Finally, the 
ponencia
 observes that since the Information
 in the case at bar does not allege the specific intent, the Court 
cannot analyze the facts using the definition of "cruelty" in the Rules 
on Child Abuse Cases. Hence, the ordinary definition of "cruelty" should
 be followed. This leads the 
ponencia
 to the following conclusion: 



 Certainly, when there is nothing to defend against, any 
preparatory act of using a gun, as by pointing it towards a minor, would
 only cause fear in the mind of that person. With the only remaining act
 of pulling the trigger of a gun, it is the near possibility of the 
resulting death or injury that will remain etched in the mind of the 
minor. There is no denying that psychological harm immediately results 
therefrom, which falls as psychological abuse, as Section 3(b) of [RA] 
7610 classifies maltreatment as child abuse based on the act committed, 
whether it be habitual or not.
[14]






 At this point, I make the observation that the 
ponencia
's method of analyzing the facts of the case 
vis-Ã¡-vis
 RA 7610 is essentially a process of elimination. While the 
ponencia

 no longer goes into this, it is also clear that the alleged act is not 
similar to any of the acts described in Article 59 of PD 603. Also, the 
act alleged against San Juan does not fall under Section 3(b)(3) and 
3(b)(4), and these are rightly excluded from the discussion. Following 
these, the 
ponencia
 explains that Section 3(b)(2) also does not 
apply, because the specific intent is not alleged in the Information. 
Finally, the act described was found to be covered by psychological 
abuse per Section 3(b)(1).

 I believe this to be a logical and efficient way of determining 
whether Section 10(a) of RA 7610 is applicable. I agree with the 
discussions and the process employed by the 
ponencia
 
for cases clearly falling under Section 10(a)
. 
However
,
 while I agree with the method of analysis, I have come to a different 
conclusion as regards the criminal liability of San Juan. 





San Juan's act of pointing a gun at the victim cannot be punished under RA 7610
 






The bulk of the discussion on RA 7610 in recent years focuses on the 
supposed intent to increase penalties for crimes committed against 
children. Oft-quoted are the explanations of Senator Jose Lina during 
the Senate deliberations on the bills which eventually culminated in the
 enactment of RA 7610. 
But I do not believe that this should 
automatically classify every act which has a child or minor as its 
victim, as child abuse punishable under Section 10(a) of RA 7610.
 RA
 7610 simply did not provide that it would apply automatically, in place
 of the RPC, once the victim is a child/minor. In fact, it explicitly 
recognized that the provisions of the RPC remain operative, but it only 
provided a higher penalty if the victim was below a certain age: 




 For purposes of this Act, the penalty for the commission of acts 
punishable under Articles 248, 249, 262, paragraph 2, and 263, paragraph
 1 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the [RPC], for the crimes of murder, 
homicide, other intentional mutilation, and serious physical injuries, 
respectively, shall be 
reclusion perpetua
 when the victim is 
under twelve (12) years of age. The penalty for the commission of acts 
punishable under Article 337, 339, 340 and 341 of Act No. 3815, as 
amended, the [RPC], for the crimes of qualified seduction, acts of 
lasciviousness with the consent of the offended party, corruption of 
minors, and white slave trade, respectively, shall be one (1) degree 
higher than that imposed by law when the victim is under twelve (12) 
years of age.
[15]






 In this connection, I quote the following passage in the 
ponencia
: 



 Thus, it is only when the Information alleges a specific intent, 
or when the provision of law demands it, must the prosecution prove its 
existence. Specific intent becomes significant for determining the 
specific provisionâwhether under the RPC, under [RA] 7610, or even other
 criminal lawsâunder which an act will be punished. As such, where the 
specific intent is not proven under a provision of law, the act may 
still be punished under other applicable penal laws provided that the 
elements of the crime [have] been satisfied. It is only when both 
general and specific intent are not proven that an accused is entitled 
to acquittal.
[16]






 It is my understanding that "specific intent" as used in the 
foregoing paragraph refers not only to the specific intent to debase, 
degrade, or demean the inherent worth and dignity of a child. It could 
refer to any specific outcome which the accused intended to cause, such 
as the intent to make a child lose his/her civil status, as required in 
paragraph 1 of Article 59 of PD 603.
[17]


 In a similar way, I understand Section 10(a) of RA 7610 as punishing acts not merely because the victim is a child, 
but because 
the victim was sought out as a victim precisely because he or she is a child
.
 This is the enduring thread I have observed in the myriad of cases in 
which the Court refused to convict the accused under Section 10(a) 
because the acts alleged were perpetrated in the spur of the moment, out
 of retaliation to a harm caused to the accused's own children, or in 
the heat of the moment or during an altercation.
[18]

 In other words, I believe that the dividing line between acts punished 
under the RPC, on the one hand, and those punished under Section 10(a), 
on the other, is the intention to commit "child abuse" â which means 
that, in the first place, the offender committed the acts against the 
child precisely because the latter is a child.

 To illustrate, I borrow the situation involved in the case of 
Bongalon v. People
,
[19]

 where the accused struck a minor on his back and face, "being then 
overwhelmed by his fatherly concern for the personal safety of his own 
minor daughters who had just suffered harm at the hands of [the minor 
victim]."
[20]
 To my mind, a 
situation like this should not be categorized as "child abuse" and would
 be more properly punished under the RPC. For one, the accused in 
Bongalon

 did not commit the act against the child because the latter is a child.
 Arguably, the accused therein would have committed the act regardless 
of who harmed his daughters, minor or otherwise. Furthermore, the 
definition of "physical injury" in the Rules on Child Abuse Cases, which
 in turn clarifies the definition of "child abuse" as punishable under 
Section 10(a) of RA 7610, is as follows: "includes but is not limited to
 lacerations, fractured bones, burns, internal injuries, severe injury 
or serious bodily harm suffered by a child."
[21]
 While this enumeration is by no means exhaustive, its interpretation should adhere to the doctrine of 
ejusdem generis
. A single slap in the heat of anger as described in the above example, if no serious injuries are proven,
should not be lumped in together with "lacerations, fractured bones, burns, internal injuries x x x."

 Applying the foregoing in the present case, I note that San 
Juan's act of pointing a gun against the minor to threaten and 
intimidate him was an act which can be perpetrated against anyone, even 
an adult. My reading of the facts is that San Juan did not choose the 
minor complainant as his victim because he was a child. If he had been 
an adult, he would have likely used the same tactics in order to assert 
himself and to make him take him seriously. 
Hence, I believe he is liable, not for a violation of Section 10(a) of RA 7610, but only of Grave Threats under the RPC.


 Furthermore, while I agree with the 
ponencia
's 
formulation of the distinction between Section 3(b)(1) and Section 
3(b)(2), and while I agree that San Juan's act does not fall under 
Section 3(b)(2) because no specific intent to debase the inherent 
dignity of the child was ever alleged in the Information, I also believe
 that the act in question does not fall under Section 3(b)(1) 
because it is not inherently cruel
. 

 In its discussion on what "cruelty" or being "cruel" means, the 
ponencia
 keenly notes: 



 The term cruelty, in its common usage, has been defined as the 
intentional
 and 
malicious

 infliction of physical suffering upon living creatures, particularly 
human beings; or, as applied to the latter, the wanton, malicious, and 
unnecessary infliction of pain upon the body, or the feelings and 
emotions; abusive treatment; 
inhumanity
; outrage. Under the RPC, cruelty is included as one of the aggravating circumstances. It presupposes that 
the
 injury caused be deliberately increased by causing other wrong and that
 other wrong be unnecessary for the execution of the purpose of the 
offender
.
[22]
 (Emphasis supplied) 
  




 Intentional, malicious, 
inhumane
 â these words used in the 
foregoing paragraph, to my mind, carry such severe implications. One 
would ordinarily understand a cruel person as one who delights in or 
derives gratification out of the suffering of his or her victim, or, 
knowing the extent of the harm his or her acts could cause, callously 
performs those acts anyway, without justifiable reason. 

 With this understanding, I struggle to characterize San Juan's 
act as inherently cruel. While any reasonable person would understand 
that a gun would cause fear in the person staring down its barrel, the 
ordinary person would not be readily aware of the long-term 
psychological effects of such fear after its source â the gun â has 
already been taken away. Hence, San Juan cannot be said to have been 
deliberately inducing psychological abuse on his victim. Furthermore, 
his motive was clear: to intimidate the minors, who he says were 
laughing at him, into respecting him and his complaint against their 
basketball game, given how early it was in the morning. His actions may 
have been excessive and immature, but they do not have the same sinister
 quality as cruelty or abuse. 

 Thus, in conclusion, while I agree with the 
ponencia'
s interpretation of Section 10(a) 
vis-Ã -vis

 Section 3(b) of RA 7610, it is my considered view that, as previously 
mentioned, San Juan should be found guilty only for Grave Threats under 
the RPC, and not Section 10(a) of RA 7610. The two-fold reason for this 
is simple: (a) San Juan's act is not punishable under Section 10(a) 
because his act was not attended by the specific intent to commit "child
 abuse" as the minority of the victim in this case was not specifically 
sought, nor was it the prime consideration for the act committed, by San
 Juan; and (b) the specific intent to debase, degrade, or demean the 
intrinsic worth and dignity of the victim was not alleged, and inherent 
cruelty was not proven.

CONCURRENCE




 
LAZARO-JAVIER, 
J
.:


 I concur in the result.

 I start with this legal doctrine â

 A statute or act is vague when it lacks comprehensible standards
 that individuals of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its 
meaning and differ in its application.
[1]
 This incomprehensibility violates the 
Constitution

 in two ways â it violates due process for failure to give persons, 
especially the parties targeted by it, fair notice of what conduct to 
avoid; and, it leaves law enforcers unchecked discretion in carrying out
 its provisions and becomes an arbitrary source of government orders.
[2]
 But a statute or act cannot be vague if it can be clarified either by a saving clause or by construction.
[3]


 This doctrine is important in cases like the present one where 
the language of the law has to be clarified. Here, the interpretation 
and application of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610, otherwise 
known as "
Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act
"
[4]

 have confused our prosecutors and courts of what is and what is not the
 prohibited conduct under it. Even the name of the crime under this 
subsection has not been consistent and certain. This case is the 
appropriate means to uphold the doctrine and settle these concerns.

 
Antecedents


 The prosecution initiated the criminal case below with this Information:



 That on or about March 26, 2014, in Valenzuela City and within the
 jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who was 
drunk, without any justifiable cause, did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully[,] and feloniously threaten the life of one [AAA] 15 years 
old (DOB: May 5, 1998) (complainant) by poking a gun at him, an act 
amounting to a crime, thereby subjecting said minor to psychological 
cruelty and emotional maltreatment.
  




 The criminal acts are the poking of the gun and the threat to the 
life of the minor. As stated in the Information, the resulting offense 
is the conjoined "psychological cruelty and emotional maltreatment." The
 prosecution identifies the crime as violation of Section 10(a) of 
Republic Act No. 7610. 

 After trial, the 
second-level court
 found that petitioner
 pointed a gun and he motioned as if to throw the stone at the minor as 
he was hurling invectives at him and his friends. The trial court 
concluded that the crime committed was 
Child Abuse under
 Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610. 

 The Court of Appeals affirmed the factual findings of the trial 
court. It however digressed from the trial court in identifying the 
offense committed â 
grave threats in relation to Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610
. The 
ponencia

 mentioned that the Court of Appeals had based its ruling on these legal
 conclusions: there was "maltreatment" that "debase[d]" and caused fear 
to the minor. 

 
My Observations


 Having read the 
ponencia
 and all the 
Reflections
, 
and having dealt with Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 in the 
past, I conclude that the prosecution, the trial court, and the Court of
 Appeals each came up with their own name of the crime that petitioner 
is guilty of. Thus, for:

 the prosecution, it is a 
violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610
 for the minor's suffering of 
psychological cruelty
 and 
emotional maltreatment
;
 the trial court, 
Child Abuse under Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610
 as a result of the 
pointing of the gun at him
; and
 the Court of Appeals it is 
grave threats in relation to Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610
 arising from his 
maltreatment
 that debased and caused fear in him. 
  


 There are things amiss in the designation of the offense. 

 
One
. There is 
no
 "psychological cruelty" â it is 
either "psychological abuse," "psychological injury" or "cruelty." More,
 "psychological abuse" is distinct from (though could be similar to) 
"emotional maltreatment."

 
Two
. "Child Abuse" itself consists of distinct modes of committing this umbrella offense. 

 
Three
. The crime of grave threats in relation to Section 
10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 is a juxtaposition of different elements 
from each of these crimes, grave threats under the Revised Penal Code 
(RPC) and Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 (which itself consists 
of different crimes of diverse elements). Maltreatment is an overarching
 criminal act for the different modes of Child Abuse (refer to Section 
3(b) of Republic Act No. 7610)
[5]
 while "debase" is specific to subsection 3(b)(2) Republic Act No. 7610.
[6]
 Causing fear to the minor is a throwback to grave threats under the RPC.
[7]


 Must individuals of common intelligence necessarily guess at the
 meaning and differ in the application of Section 10(a) of Republic Act 
No. 7610? If we are to take the different designations given by the 
prosecution, the trial court, and the Court of Appeals, to petitioner's 
offense, then for sure the Court must clarify this criminal provision 
either by a saving clause or construction. 

 
My Analysis


 Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 provides a comprehensive 
cover for every prohibited conduct which may not have been captured by 
the other provisions of Republic Act No. 7610. This is at once shown by 
the use of the word "other" in identifying the criminal acts:



 SECTION 10. Other Acts of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's Development. 








(a)


Any person who shall commit any 
other

 acts of child abuse, cruelty[,] or exploitation or be responsible for 
other conditions prejudicial to the child's development including those 
covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended, but 
not covered by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall suffer the 
penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period.
[8]
 










Section 10(a) pertains to acts other than Child Prostitution and 
Other Sexual Abuse, Child Trafficking, Obscene Publications, and 
Indecent Shows, and the criminal acts listed in Section 10(b) to (e).
[9]


 For purposes of the present case, Subsections 3(b)(1)
[10]
 and 3(b)(2) of Republic Act No. 7610 are helpful in identifying what these 
other criminal acts
 are, thus:



 SECTION 3. Definition of Terms. â

[11]
 (Emphasis supplied) 






x x x x






 As in all other criminal provisions, we begin with identifying the 
elements
 of the offense. There are 
two general headings
 for this identification - the 
actus reus
 and the 
mens rea
. Of course, there are 
strict liability regulatory offenses
 where the 
voluntary
 doing of the prohibited conduct would be enough to convict. The 
mental element

 is not essential. Conviction for these crimes can be had just by 
proving the prohibited act. There is no particular guilty mind required.

 Section 10(a) requires both the 
actus reus
 and the 
mens rea
. The 
mens rea
 however need not always be a specific intent. In some of the offenses under Section 10(a) the general intent is enough. Hence, 
Malcampo-Repollo v. People
[12]
 (Malcampo-Repollo) is correct that 
not all the offenses
 under Section 10(a) will require the 
specific intent
 of demeaning, degrading and debasing the intrinsic with and dignity of a child. However, I 
respectfully disagree
 with the ruling in 
Malcampo-Repollo

 that criminal intent is not an essential element for the other offenses
 under Section 10(a) that do not involve the specific intent demeaning, 
degrading, and debasing the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child. For 
these 
other
 crimes, the prosecution must still prove 
general criminal intent
 to obtain a conviction.



 1. 
Actus reus






 The 
actus reus
 of Section 10(a) is a combination of separate 
acts which are further divided into their respective constituent acts. 
For the present case, the 
actus reus
 for each of the offenses under this provision is as follows:









a.


any other acts of Child Abuse,

From these, we can see that while 
any other acts of Child Abuse
 is a distinct offense under Section 10(a) from its other offenses of 
any other acts of Child Cruelty and any other acts of Child Exploitation
,
 these offenses must be correlated with each other in their 
interpretation and application to avoid any confusing overlaps. This is 
because 
cruelty
 and 
exploitation
 are also constituent 
actus reus
 of 
any other acts of Child Abuse
, and therefore, the 
cruelty
 and 
exploitation
 in 
any other acts of Child Abuse
 must be distinguished from the 
cruelty
 and 
exploitation
 involved in 
any other acts of Child Cruelty
 and
 any other acts of Child Exploitation
.


 Note also that under 
any other acts of Child Abuse, cruelty
 as a constituent 
actus reus
 parallels another constituent 
actus reus
 of 
any
 other acts of Child Abuse, which is any act by deeds or words which 
debases, degrades, or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child
 as a human being
.

 The 
ponencia
 discussed the relevance of the clause "
but not covered by the
 RPC" in Section 10(a):



 SECTION 10. 
Other
 Acts of Neglect, Abuse, Cruelty or Exploitation and Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's Development.








(a)


Any person who shall commit any 
other

 acts of child abuse, cruelty[,] or exploitation or be responsible for 
other conditions prejudicial to the child's development including those 
covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended, 
but not covered by the Revised Penal Code
, as amended, shall suffer the penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period. (Emphasis supplied)










The 
ponencia
 then held that the clause modifies only the last antecedent, which is the clause that reads "
including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603
,
 as amended...." This is correct. I wish only to add that grammatically,
 the clause "including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential 
Decree No. 603" forms a single thought with the clause "but not covered 
by the 
RPC
" and therefore the latter cannot be dissociated from the former. 


 I respectfully disagree, however, with this holding in the 
ponencia
: 



 We find that the phrase "but not covered by the Revised Penal Code, as amended" 
only qualifies the immediately preceding antecedent phrase
 "including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended" under Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610, 
and not the acts enumerating the offense under said provision
.... The interpretation means that 
acts punished under Sec. 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 includes those acts punishable under Article 59
 of P.D. No. 603, 
even if not covered by the RPC
.
  




 The entire clause "including those covered by Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended, 
but not covered by the RPC
, as amended," is a 
dependent
 clause that 
modifies
, consistently with the 
ponencia
's holding, the 
closest antecedent
 - "be responsible for 
other conditions prejudicial to the child's development
â¦."

 As already explained in 
Araneta v. People
,
[16]
 this 
closest antecedent
 is itself a 
free-standing offense
 under Section 10(a), thus:



 As gleaned from the foregoing, 
the provision punishes not only those enumerated under Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, but also four distinct acts
, i.e., (a) child abuse, (b) child cruelty, (c) child exploitation, and (d) 
being responsible for conditions prejudicial to the child's development
.
 The Rules and Regulations of the questioned statute distinctly and 
separately defined child abuse, cruelty[,] and exploitation just to show
 that 
these three acts are different from one another and from the act prejudicial to the child's development
.
 Contrary to petitioner's assertion, an accused can be prosecuted and be
 convicted under Section 10(a), Article VI of Republic Act No. 7610 if 
he commits any of the four acts therein. The prosecution need not prove 
that the acts of child abuse, child cruelty[,] and child exploitation 
have resulted in the prejudice of the child because an act prejudicial 
to the development of the child is different from the former acts. 
  


 Moreover, it is a rule in statutory construction that the word 
âor" is a disjunctive term signifying dissociation and independence of 
one thing from other things enumerated. It should, as a rule, be 
construed in the sense which it ordinarily implies. Hence, 
the use of
 "or" in Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 before the phrase "be 
responsible for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development"
 supposes that there are four punishable acts therein
. First, the act of child abuse; second, child cruelty; third, child exploitation; 
and fourth, being responsible for conditions prejudicial to the child's development
.
 The fourth penalized act cannot be interpreted, as petitioner suggests,
 as a qualifying condition for the three other acts, because an analysis
 of the entire context of the questioned provision does not warrant such
 construal.
[17]
 (Emphasis supplied)
  




 Therefore, given this analysis, the 
correct
 interpretation should be, 

 The 
acts punished under Sec. 10(a)
 as 
any other acts of Child Abuse, any other acts of Child Cruelty, and any other acts of Child Exploitation
 
include those acts punishable under Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, whether or not covered by the 
RPC
. 


 However, those 
acts punished under Sec. 10(a)
 as 
being responsible for 
other
 conditions prejudicial to the child's development
 
including those acts punishable under Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603 but not covered by the 
RPC
. 
  


 The interpretation arrived at in the 
ponencia, with due respect
, 
fails to account
 for the clause "
but not covered by the RPC
, as amended." This is because the interpretation 
lumps together
 all the cognate offenses under Section 10(a) 
regardless

 of whether the RPC already covers any of these offenses if the offense 
pertains to acts criminalized under Article 59 of Presidential Decree 
No. 603, The interpretation is 
correct
 for the first three offenses under Section 10(a) â 
any other acts of Child Abuse
, any 
other acts of Child Cruelty
, and 
any other acts of Child Exploitation
 â 
but not
 in relation to the fourth one on 
being responsible for 
other
 conditions prejudicial to the child's development
.
 If the criminal act pertains to any of those in Article 59, 
Presidential Decree No. 603, this fourth offense would arise only if it 
is 
not
 covered by the 
RPC
.



 2. 
Mens rea






 For 
psychological abuse or injury, emotional maltreatment, physical abuse or injury, cruelty
, and
 any act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being
, as the constituent 
actus reus
 of 
any other acts of Child Abuse
, the 
mens rea
 element would either be a 
general
 or 
specific
 intent.

 An act is 
intentional
 when the accused has a conscious desire to commit the act 
or

 achieve the result. For example, if I say I want to kill this male 
person and shoot this individual with my pistol, my act of shooting this
 person 
and
 causing his death would be 
intentional
. If an 
11-year-old boy destroys my garden of bonsai trees, and out of anger and
 frustration, I get a piece of wood and hit his buttocks with moderate 
force, my act of hitting his buttocks with the wood would be 
intentional
. If the offense charged is 
violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 through Other Acts of Child Abuse of physical abuse
, my (
general
) 
criminal intent
 to batter the boy would suffice to satisfy the 
mens rea
 for this crime. If the boy suffers psychological trauma as a result, I would be liable for 
violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 through Other Acts of Child Cruelty
 only if I had the 
(specific) criminal intent
 of demeaning, degrading, and debasing the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child. 

 
General intent
 means that the accused voluntarily did and intended to do the wrongful act. To illustrate, where the accused is charged with 
physically abusing
 or 
injuring a child
, it is 
enough
 that the accused 
voluntarily performed the wrongful act, regardless
 of the 
nature
 of the injury that 
resulted
. 

 The offense would be 
violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 through Other Acts of Child Abuse of physical abuse
 if the criminal act 
resulted in
 any of the following physical injuries 
whether an accused intended it or otherwise
: lacerations, fractured bones, burns internal injuries, severe injury or serious bodily harm of the child.

 I do not have to 
specifically intend
 the result because this type of offense under Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 does 
not
 require a 
specific intent
 as 
mens rea
. It is 
enough

 that I performed intentionally the initiating criminal act â the 
swinging of the piece of wood towards the boy's buttocks (a wrongful 
act). The resulting injury is 
not
 a part of this offense's 
mens rea
 but of its 
actus reus
. There is 
no required mental element to bring about an injury much less the exact type of injury
. The only 
criminal mind
 I must have is the 
intent to swing the wood
 towards the boy's buttocks. Of course, since the 
resulting injury
 is part of the 
actus reus
 of this type of offense, the 
criminal act
 must be its 
proximate cause
. The 
resulting injury
 is relevant only to the analysis of the 
actus reus
 
but not
 to the 
mens rea
. 
Mabunot v. People
[18]
 supports this analysis.

 On the other hand, 
specific intent
 means that the accused 
intended the particular result
. To illustrate, where the accusation against the accused is 
cruelty
 towards a child, the 
criminal act
 that 
resulted in the denigration, debasement
, or 
degradation
 must have been 
specifically intended to happen as a consequence
 of the accused. Hence, where the 
criminal act
 causing denigration, debasement, or degradation to the child was 
done in a state of extreme and momentary anger, the specific intent to cause this specific result
 would have been absent from the doing of the act.
[19]


 
Motive
 could be crucial in 
specific intent
 crimes. Motive is the "why" someone commits an act. It is 
not
 the same thing as 
intent
. It is 
not
 the same thing as the 
guilty mind
, blameworthiness, or culpability. The motive, the "why" the accused did it, might help prove that the accused did have a 
specific criminal mind
 required by the law. 

 There are several other concepts dealing with 
mens rea
 that are relevant to Section 10(a). 

 
One
. The accused must have 
knowledge of a particular fact
 that is an element of the crime. This is called 
scienter
. The accused should know that the victim is a 
child
. 

 
Two
. We also have the notion known as 
transferred intent
. It is where the accused might be 
intending a particular harm
, but because of something else happening, this 
original intent did not come true
 and the accused ended up 
harming someone else
 or 
causing a different harm
. With 
transferred intent
, we say that the original intent to cause that original harm, the intended harm is transferred to the 
intent to cause the harm that was actually caused
. This concept was put to use in 
Mabunot
 and 
Patulot v. People
.
[20]
 (Patulot) It is codified in Article 4(1) of the 
RPC
.
[21]


 
Three.
 If the accused 
did not intend to cause
 the criminal act, but he or she 
knew
 that there was a 
substantial risk
, or 
was reasonably certain
, that the criminal act is 
going to happen
 from his or her actions, and 
nonetheless
 proceeded to do his or her actions, and the criminal act occurs, the accused had the 
mens rea
 of 
recklessness
. He or she 
ignored this substantial risk of causing the criminal act
 and 
went on to do his or her actions
 despite this 
knowledge of the substantial risk
 that something awful would happen as a result.

 On the other hand, the accused is 
negligent
 when he or she 
did not know
 or 
was not aware of the substantial risk
 of the criminal act taking place, 
but should have been or ought to have been aware
 of such substantial risk. If he or she so acts, and a criminal act ensues, he or she acted with the 
mens rea
 of 
negligence
. 



 3. 
Nomenclature of the Offense






 As for the naming protocol of the offense, I think 
violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 through
 â

 
Other acts of Child Abuse (of psychological abuse, or physical injury, or cruelty, etc.)
 
 
Other acts of Child Cruelty
, 
 
Other acts of Child Exploitation, or
 
 
Other Conditions Prejudicial to the Child's Development




 would be appropriate. This nomenclature reflects the title of 
Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 and captures how the Court in 
Araneta v. People
[22]
 has interpreted and named the offense in this subsection. 

 I do not think the naming protocol advised in the 
ponencia

 â "violation of Section 10(a) in relation to Section 3(b)(1) of 
Republic Act No. 7610" â helps in informing an accused and the public of
 the prohibited conduct being charged. No one memorizes the section or 
article number of a criminal statute. We refer to a crime as murder or 
homicide, by its 
verbal
 reference, rather than its 
numerical
 reference, because it is easier to recall and easily communicate the prohibited criminal act. 

 
Application to the Present Case




 Petitioner was specifically charged with "psychological cruelty 
and emotional maltreatment" after he poked a gun at the minor and hurled
 invectives at him. The consequence was that the minor felt threatened 
which impacted his psychological security. In other words, he suffered 
"emotional maltreatment" or "psychological abuse or injury.â

 It is 
incorrect
 for the prosecution to combine 
psychological
 with
 cruelty
. Both are terms of art in Section 10 (a) and Section 3(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 and the 
Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases
.

 In this regard, I agree with the 
ponencia
 that the reference to 
cruelty
 in Section 3(b)(1) as a constituent element of 
Other Acts of Child Abuse
 does 
not

 require the specific intent of demeaning, degrading, and debasing the 
intrinsic worth and dignity of a child. This specific intent is 
required
 only for the offense of 
Other Acts of Child Cruelty
. The constituent 
actus reus
 of 
cruelty
 in 
Other Acts of Child Abuse
 pertains to the 
ordinary meaning
 of
 cruelty
, and 
not
 to the definition of cruelty as used in the 
Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases
. The latter is, to repeat, relevant to .the offense of 
Other Acts of Child Cruelty
.

 In any event, while erroneous, the allegations in the 
Information nonetheless truly communicated to petitioner what he was 
being charged with. To my mind, the proper naming protocol for the 
offense charged and proved is 
violation of Section 10(a) through other acts of Child Abuse of psychological abuse, or emotional maltreatment
.

 There is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the 
actus reus
 â the accused pointed a gun at the minor and hurled invectives at him, which 
resulted in psychological injury
 or 
harm
 or 
emotional maltreatment to his psychological or intellectual functioning as exhibited by severe anxiety
. The complainant is indisputably a 
child
. The 
psychological injury
 was determined 
subjectively

 to the complainant child. He suffered the psychological injury and 
attested to its existence, both established beyond a reasonable doubt.

 The 
mens rea
 has also been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. First, petitioner 
knew
 he was a child when petitioner threatened him. Next, only 
general intent
 is required. Petitioner 
voluntarily pointed
 and 
intended to point
 the gun at the minor. He 
knew
 the victim to be a 
child
. He 
may
 or 
may not have intended
 to cause the minor's psychological injury but that is beside the point.

 As affirmed in 
Mabunot
 and 
Patulot
, petitioner would have nonetheless transferred his 
intent to voluntarily
 and 
intentionally
 pointing the gun at the minor, already a criminal act, to the 
consequence of this act
, which is the minor's 
psychological injury
. Hence, by 
transferred intent
, petitioner is 
deemed
 to have also 
intended to cause the psychological injury
 even without specifically intending to cause it. And this is because, again, this type of offense is a 
general intent offense
,
 only the general intent to do intentionally and voluntarily the 
original criminal act was required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
 

 
Disposition


 I concur in the result with the simple modification that the 
nomenclature of the crime is violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act 
No. 7610 
through other acts of Child Abuse of psychological abuse or emotional maltreatment
.
