[2]
 (Underscoring not supplied).
Appellants were arrested while Azul remained at large.
Appellants pleaded not guilty on arraignment.  At the pre-trial, the parties stipulated on the following facts:
Identity of the accused as the same person charged in the information;
The jurisdiction of this Honorable Court;
That accused was arrested by the operatives of Anti-Illegal Recruitment Task Force upon information given by the private complainants;
The existence of the following documents: referral letter addressed to the Office of the City Prosecutor of  Mandaluyong City, joint affidavit of arrest executed by the arresting officers; sworn statement of the private complainants and booking and information sheet;
That accused has no knowledge of the fact that private complainants [were] repatriated upon arrival in Thailand;
That accused was arrested without warrant of arrest by the elements of Anti-Illegal Recruitment Task Force.
[3]
Trial ensued.
The six (6) private complainants, Alvaro Trinidad (Alvaro), Michael Soriano (Michael), Rebecca Villaluna (Rebecca), Maricel Tumamao (Maricel), Nyann Pasquito (Nyann), and Cyrus Chavez (Cyrus), testified for the prosecution.
Azul owns Von Welt Travel Agency located in Quezon City, while Tendenilla owns Charles Visa Consultancy in Intramuros, Manila.  Rea is Tendenillaâs employee and babysitter.
Alvaro first came to Von Welt Travel Agency, upon recommendation of a friend, to apply for employment in the United States.  When said employment did not materialize, Azul introduced him to Tendenilla on 25 June 2005.  Tendenilla represented that she can send Alvaro to work in London.  Alvaro gave P114,000.00 to Azul.
[4]
Responding to a newspaper advertisement, Michael went to Von Welt Travel Agency to inquire about a job offer in the United States.  Michael was first unable to come up with the placement fee.  He returned one year later and was introduced by Azul to Tendenilla to discuss the process of employment in London. He initially gave P70,000.00 to Azul, who handed it to Tendenilla.  Before he left, he paid another P30,000.00.
[5]
Alvaro and Michael left for Thailand on 3 July 2005.  They were accompanied by Rea to Malaysia in obtaining a non-immigrant visa.  Upon returning to Thailand, they were transferred into a barrack where they were eventually arrested and deported last 12 August 2005.
[6]
Rebecca met Azul, Tendenilla, and Rea at a training center in Roces Avenue, Quezon City where they had a briefing for applicants for employment to London sometime on 27 or 28 June 2005.  She went to Azulâs house to pay P150,000.00 with her understanding that it would be given to Tendenilla.  She was advised by Azul to wait for the plane ticket coming from Tendenilla.
[7]
Maricel went to Von Welt Travel Agency to apply for employment as mushroom picker in London.  When the supposed employment did not push through, Azul accompanied her to Tendenillaâs travel agency in Intramuros.  Tendenilla told her that she was an ex-consul in Vienna and that she could deploy people to the United States, London and Thailand.  Maricel returned the following day and handed P100,000.00 to Azul, who in turn, counted it and eventually handed it over to Tendenilla.
[8]
Maricel and Rebecca left for Thailand on 5 July 2005, accompanied by Tendenilla and Rea.  Upon arriving in Thailand, they were instructed by Tendenilla to go to Malaysia to obtain a non-immigrant Thailand visa.  They went to Penang, Malaysia to have her passport stamped.  They returned to Bangkok the following day, and a week later, they were arrested by the immigration police and deported on 10 August 2005.
[9]
Nyann and Cyrus met Azul, who promised them employment as caregivers in London, through Cyrusâ mother on 15 July 2005 at the training center owned by Tendenilla.  They were told by Azul that they have to go to Thailand while waiting for their working papers to be processed.  Azul asked Nyan to prepare P200,000.00 as placement fee.
[10]
  On 18 July 2005, Nyann and Cyrus left for Thailand.  They met Tendenilla upon arriving at a hotel in Thailand.  Nyann handed her US$1,800.00
[11]
 while Cyrus gave her P100,000.00,
[12]
 both amounts allegedly represent partial payments for the processing of their visas.  Tendenilla and a certain Sir Rey then brought them to a bus station bound for Hadyai, Thailand and told them to meet Mr. Chom who would bring them to Penang, Malaysia.  After a 12-hour bus ride, they arrived in Hadyai and met Mr. Chom and other Filipino applicants.  They rode in Mr. Chomâs van going to Penang, Malaysia.  Upon reaching Penang, they were asked to sign a fictitious employment contract to expedite the processing of their non-immigrant Thailand visas.  After acquiring their visas, they went back to Bangkok, Thailand.  They stayed in Patanakan, Thailand for seven (7) days together with other Filipino applicants, before they were arrested by Thailand immigration officers.  They were detained for two (2) weeks and repatriated on 10 August 2005.  Unaware of their plights, the father of Nyann even went to the training center in Quezon City and gave the remaining balance of the processing fee in the amount of P99,200.00 to Azul.  Upon arriving in the Philippines, they went to the training center and met with Rea, who refused to divulge the whereabouts of Tendenilla.
[13]
Tendenilla denied having recruited private complainants for work abroad.  She claimed that she was a tour guide in Bangkok, Thailand.  She organized tour groups, issued plane tickets and prepared vouchers and transportation in Thailand.  She met Azul through Buenas Diaz Travel Agency and Azul was inquiring about the tour itinerary in travelling to ASEAN countries.  She remembered seeing the private complainants once while they were in Hadyai, Thailand.  She was arrested by an agent from Task Force Hunter and was charged with illegal recruitment.  She believed that she was wrongfully charged because she was being made to pay for the actions of Azul, whom they could not locate.
[14]
Rea served as the babysitter of Tendenilla.  She first met Michael and Alvaro when they all got their non-immigrant visa in Malaysia, while she knew the other private complainants through Azul, who asked her to meet them at the airport in Manila to deliver hotel vouchers.  She came back to the Philippines on 19 July 2005.  On 15 August 2005, she was taken by agents of Task Force Hunter, the Anti-Illegal Recruitment group under the Philippine National Police, and was informed of the charges against her.
[15]
After trial, the RTC rendered judgment convicting appellants of the crime of illegal recruitment in large scale.  The dispositive portion of the decision reads:
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused MARIA JENNY REA y GUEVARRA and ESTRELLITA TENDENILLA GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Recruitment in large scale, and accordingly, they are each sentenced to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT and to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) plus costs.
Accused are further ordered to indemnify each of the complainants, Michael NiÃ±o Soriano P100,000.00, Maricel Tumamao P150,000.00, Dandy Mendoza P250,000.00, Rebecca Villaluna P150,000.00, Nyann Pasquito P200,000.00, Alvaro Trinidad P120,000.00 and Cyrus Chavez P132,000.00.
Meanwhile, let the case against accused G[i]nette Azul be placed in the archives to be revived upon her arrest and let alias warrant of arrest be issued against her.
[16]
The trial court found that all elements of illegal recruitment in large scale were established through the testimonies of the private complainants and that appellants conspired to commit the crime.
On 10 January 2011, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision.
Appellants filed a notice of appeal upon receipt of the unfavorable decision.  On 5 September 2011, this Court directed the parties to simultaneously submit their respective supplemental briefs.  The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Manifestation stating that it would no longer file any supplemental brief and would instead adopt its appellee's brief.  Appellants meanwhile filed their Supplemental Brief and maintained that there was no sufficient evidence to prove that appellants offered jobs to the private complainants.
Appellants essentially argue that the prosecution has failed to establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  Appellants claim that their supposed criminal liability is attributed to their mere presence in Thailand at the time when the private complainants were also there.  They assert that it was Azul, based on the testimonies of the private complainants, who promised employment abroad and who received payment from them.  Rea avers that delivering a voucher, meeting people at the airport and sleeping in the house of Tendenilla can hardly qualify as recruitment activities.
The OSG defends the trial courtâs evaluation of the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.  The OSG posits that the testimonies of private complainants clearly establish that Tendenilla made representations that she could provide employment abroad.  The OSG also implicates Rea as a co-conspirator by her presence when private complainants paid their placement fees and at the training center during the orientation of private complainants; and by accompanying private complainants to Thailand.
The crime of illegal recruitment in large scale is committed upon concurrence of these (3) elements, namely: (1) the offenders undertake any activity within the meaning of recruitment and placement defined in Article 13(b) or any prohibited practices enumerated in Article 34 of the Labor Code; (2) the offenders have no valid license or authority required by law to enable them to lawfully engage in the recruitment and placement of workers; and (3) the offenders commit the acts against three or more persons, individually or as a group.
[17]
Recruitment and placement is defined in Article 13(b) of the Labor Code as "any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring worker; and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not."
Simply put, illegal recruitment is committed by persons who, without authority from the government, give the impression that they have the power to send workers abroad for employment purposes.
[18]
That Tendenilla made misrepresentations concerning her purported power to recruit for overseas employment; and personally, or through Azul but on her behalf, collected placement fees from private complainants were clearly established from the testimonies of private complainants themselves, to wit:

Q: 
 
Do you have receipt that it was received by Estrellita Tendenilla?
 
 
 
A: 
 
She did not give any receipt, maâam.
[24]
 
 
As culled from the testimonies of the private complainants, it was established that first, they all met Tendenilla through Azul; second, Tendenilla personally, or through Azul, assured them that she has the power and capacity to deploy workers to London; third, they also paid Tendenilla, directly or through Azul, placement fees in the amounts ranging from P100,000.00 to P200,000.00 each; fourth, they were sent first to Thailand while waiting for the processing of their working visas to London; fifth, they travelled to Penang, Malaysia to obtain a non-immigrant Thailand visa to validate their stay in Thailand; and sixth, they were arrested and deported back to the Philippines by the Thailand immigration office.
To prove illegal recruitment, it must be shown that appellant gave complainants the distinct impression that he had the power or ability to send complainants abroad for work such that the latter were convinced to part with their money in order to be employed.
[25]
The first element of large scale illegal recruitment was proven by the testimonies of the private complainants which the trial court found to be credible and convincing.  We find that they were given in a clear, positive and straightforward manner.  Between the positive and categorical testimonies of private complainants and the unsubstantiated denials of appellants, we give more weight to the former.
The certification issued by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration that Tendenilla is not licensed to recruit workers for overseas employment constitutes the second element of the crime of illegal recruitment.
The third element is likewise satisfied when at least six (6) individuals filed the case, claimed and in fact, were found to have been defrauded by appellants.
As for Reaâs participation as a principal, it was likewise established by the testimonies of the following witnesses, to wit:

[30]
 
 
Testimony of Cyrus Chavez:
 
 
Q: 
 
What happened when you went to Roces Avenue?
 
 
 
A: 
 
I went there with my girlfriend, maâam, we met Jenny Rea one of the accused, maâam.
 
 
 
Q:
 
What happened during your meeting with Jenny Rea?
 
 
 
A: 
 
She said, "you just have to wait we [are] already processing your paper and if you want to reimburse your money you have just to wait because weâre already recruiting some of the applicants and the money that the applicants will be giving are the one[s] will (sic) be giving back to you." Maâam.
 
 
 
Q: 
 
It was Jenny Rea who told you that?
 
 
 
A: 
 
Yes, maâam and they actually using some other peopleâs money to pay us back. Then after that she also said that, "hinding-hindi namin ilalabas si Estrellita Tendenilla sa inyo, hindi naming siya isusuko at hindi naming siya ipakikita."
 
 
 
Q: 
 
It was Jenny Rea who told you that?
 
 
 
A: 
 
Yes, maâam, because they thought weâre all very angry, maâam. "Hindi namin siya ilalabas, kailangan maghintay kayo nandiyan na ang papers ninyo, gumastos na kami ng pera diyan, maghintay kayo."
[31]
 
 
Reaâs complicity was proven by her participation during the recruitment at the training center; the fact that she accompanied Rebecca and Maricel on their flight to Thailand; her presence in the hotel in Thailand; the accommodation she provided while in Thailand; that she accompanied complainants to Malaysia to obtain a non-immigrant visas; and when she offered to re-deploy the disgruntled complainants, this time, to Korea.
Conspiracy may be deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated; or from the acts of the accused evincing a joint or common purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.
[32]
It is equally clear from the narration of private complainants that appellants, together with Azul, conspired to commit the crime of illegal recruitment.  Azul referred all private complainants to Tendenilla, who made representations that she could deploy them abroad.  It was either Azul or Tendenilla who received the payment of placement fees.  And as previously stated, Rea met some of the complainants at the training center, and accompanied some of them while in Thailand.  Their actions showed unity of purpose and, taken all together, leave no doubt that they are co-conspirators.
We reiterate the findings of the Court of Appeals, to wit:
In the case at bar, it cannot be doubted that both accused-appellants indispensably cooperated and coordinated in illegally recruiting the private complainants.  From the evidence, it can be seen that the success of the scheme depended on accused-appellantsâ joint efforts.  Estrellita Tendenilla directly dealt with the private complainants, promising them employment, demanding money from them, conducting dubious trainings, and sending them to Thailand.  Maria Jenny Rea, on the other hand, covered the next phase of the process, that is, travelling with the private complainants to Thailand, bringing them to the border of Thailand and Malaysia, securing their fraudulent non-immigrant visas, and accompanying them back to the Philippines.
[33]
Based on the foregoing, appellants were correctly found guilty of large scale illegal recruitment tantamount to economic sabotage.
Under Section 7(b) of Republic Act No. 8042,
[34]
 the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than P500,000.00 nor more than P1,000,000.00 shall be imposed if illegal recruitment constitutes economic sabotage.  Thus, the trial court, as affirmed by the appellate court, is correct in imposing the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 for each of the appellants.
WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 03178 affirming the trial courtâs conviction of appellants Maria Jenny Rea y Guevarra and Estrellita Tendenilla for large scale illegal recruitment is 
AFFIRMED
