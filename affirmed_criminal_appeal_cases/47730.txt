PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. DANILO ALFARO Y YALUNG, APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




PER CURIAM:


Incestuous rape is at all times despicable and ultimately reprehensible as its sordidness is beyond the understanding and imagination of any normal human being.  As one of the most perverted forms of sexual aberration, it deserves this society's condemnation without any compassion.
For automatic review is the Decision
[1]
 dated October 23, 1998 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 55, Macabebe, Pampanga in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-1887-M and 97-1888-M finding Danilo Y. Alfaro, appellant herein, guilty of two counts of rape and imposing upon him the supreme penalty of death.
Appellant was charged with rape in two Informations
[2]
 which, except for the dates of its commission, similarly read as follows:
 "That on or about the [15
th
 day of January 1996
[3]
 and 14
th
 day of February 1996
[4]
], in Barangay 
San Nicolas
, Municipality of 
San Simon
, Province of Pampanga, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, DANILO ALFARO Y YALUNG alias DAN/DANNY, with lewd design, taking advantage of superior strength and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with 
her daughter, 
AAA, 
13 years old,
 against her will and without her consent.
"Contrary to law."
Upon arraignment, appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded "not guilty" to both charges.
[5]
 Thereafter, the two cases were jointly heard. The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely: AAA, the victim; 
Maria Luisa Alfaro
, the victim's mother; and Dr. Marie Antoinette Golding who examined the victim.  Their testimonies established the following:
AAA was born on September 14, 1983 to appellant and 
Maria Luisa
 as shown by her Certificate of Live Birth.
[6]
 They live in 
San Nicolas, San Simon
, Pampanga. On January 15, 1996, at around 10:00 o'clock in the evening, while AAA was sleeping in their house she was suddenly roused from sleep by appellant when he removed her panty and placed himself on top of her.
[7]
 She felt terrible pain as he inserted his penis in her vagina.  He continued molesting her sexually until he was able to satisfy his bestial lust.
[8]
After that harrowing incident, AAA noticed a white sticky substance in her private part.  Then she wore her panty and slept.
Again, on February 14, 1996, at around 11:00 o'clock in the evening, while AAA and her two brothers were sleeping in their house, she was awakened by appellant as he undressed her and placed himself on top of her, inserting his penis into her vagina.
[9]
 She cried because it was painful. Thereafter, she found a white sticky substance in her private part.
[10]
AAA did not immediately tell the incidents to anybody because appellant threatened to kill her and her mother if she would do so.
[11]
Maria Luisa
 testified that in the evening of April 23, 1997, she caught appellant stooping over their sleeping daughter AAA and kissing her genitalia.
[12]
 Surprised by his wife's presence, he immediately went out with his penis protruding out of his shorts.
[13]
 He warned her to keep quiet or else he would kill her.  This incident prompted AAA to inform her mother that appellant sexually molested her on January 15 and February 14, 1996.
On April 25, 1997, AAA accompanied by her mother, was examined by Dr. Marie Antoinette Golding, a resident physician of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Jose B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital in Pampanga.  On April 27, 1997, she issued a Medico-Legal O.B. -Gyne Report
[14]
 stating that the victim's hymen has superficial healed lacerations at 3:00 o'clock and 9:00 o'clock positions which could have been caused by a man's erect organ
[15]
 and by the rape incidents on January 15, and February 14, 1996.  She also found that AAA's introitus could admit two fingers with ease.
On April 26, 1997, 
Maria Luisa
 and her daughter AAA went to the Apalit Police Station and reported the incidents.  AAA executed a 
"Sinumpaang Salaysay,"
 marked as Exhibit "B,"
[16]
 partly quoted as follows:

(Underscoring ours)
 
 
Maria Luisa
 also executed an affidavit
[17]
 stating that she caught appellant kissing AAA's genital organ.  Because of this incident, she came to know that he raped AAA twice in the past.
Both AAA and 
Maria Luisa
 confirmed the contents of their respective 
"Sinumpaang Salaysay"
 during the trial.
The defense presented appellant as its sole witness.  He vehemently denied the charges, contending that on January 15, 1996, he was at home; and that on February 14, 1996, he was in Manila.
[18]
 He claimed that in testifying against him, his wife and daughter were ill motivated because he abandoned them for nine years.  Moreover, that it took them one year before reporting the incidents to the authorities engenders doubt on the veracity of the charges.
On October 23, 1998, the trial court rendered its Decision convicting appellant of two counts of incestuous rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, thus:
 "The acts committed by the accused against his daughter constitutes the abhorable (sic) crime of incestuous rape committed with the gravest abuse of parental authority.  
The accused had the moral ascendancy and influence that substitutes for the violence or intimidation required in rape cases.  His act of having sexual intercourse with his daughter who was then at the tender age of thirteen (13) years old may be considered to have the effect of statutory rape.  The Court also believes that strong force of intimidation by implication existed during the sexual molestation committed by the accused Danilo Alfaro against his daughter AAA.  
His defense of alibi that he was elsewhere at the time, and his explanation that he did not do it as he loves his family and blamed his parents-in-law as those who were responsible in bringing about the accusation against him because they were mad at him, is totally rejected as they are unbelievable.
"
WHEREFORE
, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of rape and as a consequence of which and pursuant to Art. 335 of the Revised Penal code, he is hereby sentenced to the corresponding mandatory penalty of death and he is likewise ordered to indemnify the offended party the sum of P100,000.00."
[19]
Hence, this appeal, appellant ascribing to the trial court the following assignments of error:
 "I
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF ILL-MOTIVE ON THEIR PART AND THE INCREDIBLE LENGTH OF TIME IT TOOK THE COMPLAINANT TO REPORT THE CRIME.
"II
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF TWO (2) COUNTS OF RAPE."
[20]
The Solicitor General counters that if indeed appellant's wife and daughter were ill motivated, then they should have charged him earlier considering that he abandoned them for nine years.  Likewise, AAA failed to report the incidents to the authorities immediately because he threatened to kill her and her mother.
After a careful review and evaluation of the entire record, we agree with the trial court that appellant is guilty as charged.
AAA testified in a straightforward, candid and convincing manner, which leaves no room for doubt that she was in fact ravished twice by her own father.  She positively identified him as her rapist.  She testified as follows:

[24]
 (Underscoring ours)
 
 
The above testimony vividly describes AAA's harrowing experience in the hands of her own father. It bears emphasis that appellant resorted to force, threat and intimidation to consummate his lust.  In her 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
,
[25]
 AAA stated: 
"pinagsamantalahan (ginahasa) niya po ako 
ng puwersahan na may
 
halong pananakot at pagbabantang ako ay papatayin."
  AAA categorically affirmed such declaration when she testified in court.
[26]
 Courts usually give credence to such testimony, particularly if it constitutes incestuous rape, because, normally, no person would be willing to undergo the humiliation of a public trial and to testify on the details of her ordeal were it not to condemn an injustice.
[27]
It is a settled jurisprudence that testimonies of child-victims are given full weight and credit.  When a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed.
[28]
 Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.
[29]
 Young as she was then, AAA withstood all the rigors of the case, such as the initial police interrogation, the medical examination, the formal charge, the public trial and the cross-examination. And she never wavered in her testimony even after it was explained to her that her father could be meted the death penalty if found guilty.
[30]
 If it was true that she merely made up the charge, she should have been bothered by her conscience at the sight of her father in a prisoner's garb at the detention cell.  It certainly would take a most senseless kind of depravity for a young daughter to concoct a story of rape which would consign her own father to the supreme penalty of death if the same were not the truth.
[31]
Moreover AAA's testimony is corroborated by the findings of Dr. Golding that the lacerations on her hymen were compatible with the incidents of rape on January 15 and February 14, 1996.  According to Dr. Golding, the multiple healed hymenal lacerations at 3:00 o'clock and 9:00 o'clock positions could have been caused by an erect organ of a man
[32]
 and that her introitus could admit two fingers with ease.
As against AAA's positive and categorical testimony, appellant could only proffer the defense of alibi.  In a chain of cases, we ruled that for alibi to prosper, it must be proven that during the commission of the crime, the accused was in another place and that it was physically impossible for him to be at the 
locus criminis
.
[33]
 This is not so in the present case. Appellant admitted in his testimony
[34]
 that he was at home with his family in 
San Simon
, Pampanga on January 15, 1996 when the crime took place.  It must be recalled that the rape was committed in the evening of that day at 
San Nicolas
 of the same town.  We can safely conclude, therefore, that it was physically possible for appellant to be at the scene of the crime during its commission.
Moreover, while appellant sought to establish that he went to Manila on February 14, 1996 when the second rape was committed, however, he could not categorically admit he really left for Manila.  Instead, he declared that he went home at 
San Simon
 because it was Valentine's day, thus:

When his own counsel asked appellant on re-direct examination to clarify whether he was in Manila or at home on February 14, 1996, appellant could not answer, thus:
 
 
 
"ATTY. HERNANDEZ

Obviously, appellant's testimony bears the badges of falsehood.  His unsubstantiated defense of alibi must, therefore, fail.
Appellant's argument that the delay in reporting the incidents renders the charges against him doubtful should also fail.  Delay in reporting an incident if rape is not necessarily and indication that the charge is fabricated.
[36]
 In these cases, the delay could be attributed to AAA's tender age and appellant's threat to kill her and her mother if she would tell anyone what he did to her.
[37]
 It is therefore, easy to see why AAA kept her silence.  Indeed, a rape victim's actions are oftentimes moved by fear rather than by reason.  In incestuous rape, this fear is magnified because the victim usually lives under the same roof as the perpetrator or is at any rate subject to his dominance because of their blood relationship.
[38]
Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, applicable to these cases, provides:
 "Art. 335.  
When and how rape is committed
. - Rape is committed 
by having carnal knowledge of a woman 
under 
any
 of the following circumstances:
 
By using force or intimidation;
xxx
"The 
death penalty
 shall be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
 
When the victim is 
under eighteen (18) years of age
 and the 
offender
 is a 
parent
, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree of the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
 
 xxx" (Underscoring ours)
There is no doubt that appellant 
had carnal knowledge of AAA through force and intimidation
 on January 15, 1996 and February 14, 1996 as positively testified to by her.
To justify the imposition of the death penalty, pursuant to the above provisions, the qualifying circumstances of 
minority
 and 
relationship
 must be specifically alleged in the Information and duly proved during the trial with equal certainty as the crime itself.
[39]
Here, AAA's Certificate of Live birth shows that she was born on September 14, 1983.  She was thus twelve years and five months old when she was raped by her father on January 15 and February 14, 1996.  Likewise, there is no doubt that appellant is her biological father.  Aside from the entry
[40]
 in the Certificate of Live Birth attesting to such fact, appellant himself admitted in open court that he is the father of the victim, thus:
 "
DIRECT EXAMINATION
ON DANILO ALFARO BY
ATTY. HERNANDO HERNANDEZ
 
 
ATTY. HERNANDEZ
Questioning
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mr. Witness, do you know the complainant AAA?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
WITNESS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
Why do you know her? 
 
 
 
A 
 
She is my daughter, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
With whom is she your daughter? 
 
 
 
A 
 
With my wife 
Maria Luisa Alfaro
, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
xxx
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
What was AAA like as a daughter to you?
 
 
 
A 
 
AAA is so close to me."
[41]
 (Underscoring ours)
 
 
Clearly, the concurrence of the minority of AAA and her relationship to appellant, alleged in the Information and sufficiently proved by the prosecution, justifies the imposition of the death penalty upon him for each count of rape.
We noticed, however, that the trial court imposed the death penalty upon appellant in both cases. We rectify this error by stressing that he should be meted out the penalty of death in each case considering that the two charges of rape are separate and distinct from each other.
With respect to the civil liability of appellant, the prevailing jurisprudence is that where, as here, the death penalty is imposed, the victim is entitled to an indemnity 
ex delicto
 in the sum of P75,000.00 for each count of rape, instead of P100,000.00 awarded by the trial court.  Such award is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape.
[42]
We likewise award the victim moral damages in the amount of P75,000.00 in each case, without need of pleading or proof of basis thereof.
[43]
 This is so because the anguish and the pain she has to endure are evident.
[44]
 In addition, the victim should be awarded P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape to deter other fathers with perverse tendencies or aberrant sexual behavior from sexually abusing their daughters.
[45]
Three (3) members of the Court, although maintaining their adherence to the separate opinions expressed in 
People vs. Echegaray
 that R.A. No. 7659, insofar as it prescribes the penalty of death is unconstitutional, nevertheless submit to the ruling of the majority that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty should accordingly be imposed.
WHEREFORE
, the appealed Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 55, Macabebe, Pampanga in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-1887-M and 97-1888-M, finding appellant Danilo Alfaro 
GUILTY
 beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of incestuous rape is 
AFFIRMED
, with the following 
modifications
:
(1) Appellant is sentenced to 
DEATH
 for each count of rape; and
(2) In each count of, he is ordered to pay the victim P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.
Let the records of this case, upon finality of this Decision, be forwarded to the Office of the President for the possible exercise of her pardoning power pursuant to Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 25 of RA 7659.

Bakit sa tagal ng panahon na nakalipas, ngayon lamang kayo nag-report dito sa aming himpilan ng Pulisya ng bayang ito hinggil sa kasong ito?
 
 
 
S:
 
Kasi po noong Abril 23, 1997 humigit-kumulang alas 10:00 ng gabi sa aming tirahan ay nahuli ko mismo sa akto ang aking asawang si Danilo na hinahalikan ang kaselanan (vagina) ni AAA na aking labis na ikinagulat at sa kabiglaanan ay napasigaw ako at kaagad kong kinompronta si Danilo sa kanyang ginagawang masama sa aming anak na kanya namang ikinaila pero sa puntong ito ay 
nagtapat sa akin si AAA at isinumbong ang mga naunang pinag-gagawa sa kanya ng kanyang ama na hindi lamang kaagad nagsumbong dahil siya ay tinatakot at pinag-babantaang papatayin ng kanyang tatay kung siya ay magsusumbong sa akin o kanino pa man.
 Nang matuklasan ko ang mga bagay na ito ay kaagad na akong nagsumbong dito sa Pulisya para magsampa ng demanda laban kay Danilo."
