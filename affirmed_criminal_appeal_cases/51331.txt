THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 139610, August 12, 2002 ]


AUREA R. MONTEVERDE, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:




Time and time again, this Court has emphasized the need to stamp 
out graft and corruption in the government. Indeed, the tentacles of 
greed must be cut and the offenders punished. However, this objective 
can be accomplished only if the evidence presented by the prosecution 
passes the test of moral certainty. Where doubt lingers, as in this 
case, the Court is mandated to uphold the presumption of innocence 
guaranteed by our Constitution to the accused.  


The Case 


Before us is a Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the April 29, 1999 Decision
[1]
 and February 3, 2000 Resolution
[2]

 of the Sandiganbayan (Second Division) in Criminal Case No. 18768. The 
dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads as follows: 




âWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered 
finding accused AUREA MONTEVERDE y RASUELO guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of the crime of Falsification of Commercial Document under Article
 172 of the Revised Penal Code, and in default of any mitigating or 
aggravating circumstances and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, 
she is hereby sentenced to suffer a prison term of SIX (6) MONTHS of 
Arresto Mayor as minimum, to SIX (6) YEARS of Prision Correccional as 
maximum, to pay a fine of Five Thousand (P5,000.00) pesos with 
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, with all the accessory 
penalties of the law, and to pay the cost. 


âShe shall be credited with the full period of any preventive 
imprisonment suffered, pursuant to and as mandated by Batas Pambansa 
Blg. 85. 


âThe facts from which the civil liability may arise not being indubitable, there is no pronouncement as to the same. 


âThe bailbond of herein accused is hereby ordered cancelled.â
[3]
 




The assailed resolution denied petitionerâs Motion for Reconsideration. 


This case originated from the Information dated February 4, 1993, 
signed by Special Prosecution Officer Gualberto J. dela Llana with the 
approval of then Ombudsman Conrado M. Vasquez. Charging petitioner with 
estafa through falsification of commercial documents, the accusatory 
portion reads thus: 




âThat on or about January 17, 1991, or sometime prior or 
subsequent thereto, in Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, a public officer, 
being the Chairman of Barangay 124 of Zone 10, District 1, Malaya, 
Balut, Tondo, Manila with intent to defraud, and by taking advantage of 
[her] official position and to liquidate the funds donated/granted by 
the Philippine Games and Amusement Corporation submitted Sales Invoice 
No. 21568 dated January 17, 1991 in the amount of P13,565.00 allegedly 
issued by Sanford Hardware when in truth and in fact said sales invoice 
is falsified and later did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously misappropriate, misapply and convert the same to her 
personal use and benefit, to the damage of the Government and which 
crime was committed in relation to her office.â
[4]
 




During her arraignment on April 5, 1993, petitioner, assisted by her counsel de parte,
[5]
 pleaded not guilty.
[6]

 After trial on the merits, the Sandiganbayan acquitted petitioner of 
the crime of estafa, but convicted her of falsification of a commercial 
document under Article 172 of the Revised Penal Code. 


The Facts 


Version of the Prosecution 


The prosecutionâs version of the facts is curtly summarized by the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) as follows: 




âPetitioner Aurea A. Monteverde was from 1991 to 1993 the 
Barangay Chairman of Barangay 124 of Zone 10, District 1, Malaya, Balut,
 Tondo, Manila. In that capacity, she received the amount of P44,800.00 
from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR). The 
amount was spent for lighting, cleanliness and beautification programs 
of the Barangay. To liquidate the amount, she submitted a financial 
statement (Exhibits â1 to 1-A-3â) with copies of sales invoices/receipts
 to PAGCOR. 


âSometime in August 1991, Antonio R. Araza, Jose Salvatierra, 
Santos L. Lopez, and Narciso Cruz, residents of Brgy. 124, charged 
Petitioner and Bella Evangelista, then Barangay Treasurer, with 
Malversation of the following funds: 1.) P82,500.00 from [the] Barangay 
General Fund; 2.) P44,800.00 from the PAGCOR; and 3.) P600.00 allowance 
of Kagawad Lito Galinda for the period July 16, to December 1990. The 
complaints were docketed as OMB-0-91-12694 and OMB-0-92-0643 (Exhs. A, B
 and C).â
[7]
 




Version of the Defense 


The foregoing account is reiterated by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in its Memorandum.
[8]
 The petitioner did not submit her own Memorandum, but merely adopted the position of the OSG which recommended her acquittal. 


Version of the Sandiganbayan 


The foregoing narration does not adequately explain the evidence. 
In fairness to the Sandiganbayan (âSBNâ hereafter) which is being 
faulted with reversible errors by petitioner and the OSG, we deem it 
prudent to quote the facts and the evidence it relied upon in its 
assailed Decision, as follows: 




âEVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION 




In its bid to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable 
doubt, the People presented the following documentary evidence: 


Exhibit A which is a letter complaint addressed to the 
Ombudsman dated September 2, 1991 signed by Santos Lopez, Narciso Cruz, 
Antonio Araza and Jose Salvatierra; 
    
  
Exhibit B which is a Joint-Affidavit of the said four 
(4) complainants subscribed and sworn to before a Notary Public on 
September 8, 1991; 
    
  
Exhibit C which is a letter dated June 13, 1991 signed
 by complainants Jose Salvatierra and Antonio Araza addressed to Mr. 
Manuel de la Fuente of the Chief Barangay Bureau, City of Manila; 
    
  
Exhibit D which is the cover of the Booklet of Sales invoice[s]/Receipts of Sanford Hardware. 
    
  
  Exhibit D-1 which is the duplicate original copy of Sales Invoice No. 21568 dated July 20, 1981 listing only three (3) items; 
    
  
  Exhibit D-1-A which is a genuine machine copy of Exhibit D-1; 
    
  
Exhibit E which is a machine copy of an official 
receipt with Aurea Monteverde appearing as buyer and listing eleven 
items as articles purchased; 
    
  
Exhibit E-1 which is a certification of Luz Co, 
Manager of Sanford Hardware stating that Exhibit E is not a genuine 
reproduction of the duplicate original; 
    
  
Exhibit F (offered lately) is a xerox copy of Invoice No. 21568 dated January 17, 1991; 
    
  
Exhibit G is a machine copy of an undated letter 
signed by Bella Evangelista authorizing Antonio Araza to verify the 
authenticity of Invoice No. 21568 dated January 17, 1991 in the sum of 
P13,565.00 

  as well as witnesses Luz Co y Tan and Antonio Araza y Reposo.







    âLUZ CO y TAN declared that she is the manager of Sanford Hardware 
since 1976, that Exhibit D-1 which is [a] duplicate copy of Invoice No. 
21568 dated July 2, 1981 where the amount of purchase is only P157.00 is
 the invoice used by her firm in the conduct of its business; that 
Exhibit E was not her receipt and that she executed a certification to 
that effect (Exhibit E-1) when required by a male person; that she does 
not know the entries appearing in Exhibit E but the entries in Exhibit 
D-1 are of her business; that Sanford Hardware is owned by [her] 
sister-in-law Delia Co; that there are three copies of the sales invoice
 her business is issuing, and the third copy or last copy is the one 
left in the store, and that the one who approached her and asked about 
Exhibit E is one Narciso Cruz and when she answered that she did not 
issue Exhibit E she was requested to execute an affidavit; that she does
 not know accused Aurea Monteverde and that she had no delivery of 
hardware materials to the Barangay on January 17, 1991 (TSN May 14, 
1993). 
    
âIt was the testimony of ANTONIO ARAZA that he is a resident of 
2256 Malaya St., Balut, Tondo, Manila and that he secured a copy of 
Exhibits E and F from the Barangay Treasurer; that he brought the same 
to the owner of the Sanford Hardware for verification; that Luz Co to 
whom he talked x x x in said store manifested that said Exhibits E and F
 are not issued by the firm; and for which he requested Luz Co to issue a
 certification (Exhibit E-1); that after realizing that the receipts 
used by the accused are falsified receipts, he signed letter complaints 
and [a] Joint-Affidavit together with Santos Lopez, Narciso Cruz and 
Jose Salvatierra, and charged the accused before the Ombudsman; that the
 money involved in this case are barangay funds because it was donated 
by the PAGCOR to the Barangay and he was able to secure a copy from the 
PAGCOR evidencing that it was donated to the Barangay but the copy was 
submitted to the Ombudsman; that the Barangay Treasurer lent to him the 
receipts with the advice to verify it from the proprietor of [the] 
Hardware and she even gave a letter of authorization to him (Exhibit G);
 that the P13,565.00 appearing in Exhibits E and F was not used to buy 
electrical materials or lightings, and the bulbs in the Meralco post 
were donated by Councilor Rene Jose (TSN March 18, 1994). 


âEVIDENCE FOR THE ACCUSED 


âThe defense presented eighty-one (81) Exhibits with Exhibits 35 
to 80 dealing with certificates of commendation in favor of the accused 
during her stint as Barangay Chairman from 1991 to 1993 and even prior 
to her being a Barangay Chairman. Exhibits 1 with its submarkings 
(Exhibits 1-A to Exhibits 1-A-3) is a letter of the accused addressed to
 Alice LI Reyes of the PAGCOR with attachment she captioned Financial 
Statement; Exhibits 2 to 15 are Sales Invoices/Receipts from different 
hardware stores and individuals while Exhibits 16 and 17 are pictures 
depicting a basketball court portion thereof being sub-marked, and 
Exhibits 18 to 32 are fifteen (15) pictures depicting different alleys 
at Barangay 124. Exhibit 33 is a turn-over certificate/record of the 
Barangay properties signed by the incoming Barangay Chairman with the 
third page submarked as Exhibits 33-A to 33-b-2; and Exhibit 34 is the 
counter-affidavit of the accused sworn to before a Notary Public on 
September 5, 1991. Exhibit 81 is a Joint-Affidavit of Alfonso Cua Jr. 
and Joel Magbanua. 


âAside from her, the accused presented ALFONSO CUA, JR. whose 
testimony is as follows: that he knows the accused to be the Chairman of
 Barangay 124 from 1991 up to 1992 while he was a Barangay Tanod in the 
said Barangay; that one project of the accused was the installation of 
lights or lighting the streets and playgrounds in the Barangay; that in 
January 1991 materials were delivered to the house of the Barangay 
Chairman (accused) and around three (3) days thereafter, he helped in 
the installation of the electrical materials consisting of electrical 
wirings, electrical tapes, bulbs, lamps and lamp covers, and it took 
them (he and the husband of the accused) about three Sundays in doing 
so; that he executed a Joint-Affidavit together with one Joel Magbanua 
in connection with the incident (Exhibit 81) (TSN April 2, 1997). 


âTestifying in her behalf accused took the witness stand and declared: 




âThat she was the Barangay Chairman in Brgy. 124 since 1989 to 
1994; that in January 1991 she received donation or cash money in the 
amount of P44,800.00 from PAGCOR which she used in Barangay projects 
like lighting, and cleanliness and beautification; that she reported the
 matter to PAGCOR and submitted [a] financial statement (Exhibits 1 to 
1-A, 1-A-1); that when she purchased electrical and hardware items from 
Sanford Hardware she was issued a receipt (Exhibit 9) and considering 
Exhibit D-1 and D-1-A, it would appear that Sanford Hardware issued two 
(2) receipts; she denied the charge of Estafa thru Falsification of 
Commercial Documents, and claimed that with the meager amount involved, 
she is not going to sacrifice her good name and reputation; she then 
identified x x x several awards she received (Exhibits 35 to 79); that 
she was the one who personally purchased the items in Exhibit F, and she
 actually paid the same in cash for which she was issued Exhibit 9 
(Exhibit F and 9 contain the same items); that the receipt was issued in
 her name and the money was in her possession that was why it was she 
and not the Barangay Treasurer who personally made the purchase; that 
the PAGCOR check was issued in her name and was directly given to her 
and so she was the one who encashed the check accompanied by one of the 
councilors but she did not turn over the cash to the treasurer; that 
even after she came to know of the existence of Exhibit E, she did not 
go to Sanford Hardware to inquire about the said document; that the 
original of the said exhibit was given to her but she submitted it to 
PAGCOR. (TSN September 3, November 5, 1996 and April 1, 1997).ââ
[9]
 


Ruling of the Sandiganbayan 


The assailed Decision noted that petitioner was supposed to have 
been charged with the complex crime of estafa through falsification of a
 commercial document. However, there was no clear allegation in the 
Information that the falsification was a necessary means to commit the 
estafa.
[10]
 Nevertheless, going along âwith thesuppositionâ that a complex crime had been charged, the SBN held: 




âDespite the ambiguity and disquietude, however, the court is 
constrained to go with the supposition that what has been charged is 
that of a complex crime, otherwise the logical consequence is that the 
accused has been indicted with two crimes - that of Estafa and that of 
Falsification of Commercial Document which is not beneficial to her.â
[11]
 




The anti-graft court acquitted petitioner of estafa, because there 
was no evidence that funds had been misappropriated or converted.
[12]
 Neither was there proof that petitioner had been required to account for the money received.
[13]
 Without these proofs, no conviction for estafa was possible.
[14]
 


However, the court a quo convicted her for allegedly falsifying the
 document she had submitted to show that the P13,565 donated by PAGCOR 
was used and spent for lighting materials for her barangay. According to
 the SBN, the falsification became very clear when the document was 
compared with another one purporting to be a duplicate original 
presented by the prosecution.
[15]

 While the prosecution did not present any proof evidencing that it was 
petitioner who had caused the falsification, the SBN relied on the 
presumption that in the absence of a satisfactory explanation, a person 
who is found in possession of a forged document, and who uses it, is the
 forger.
[16]
 


Nevertheless, petitioner was not convicted of falsification as 
defined by Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code, because there was no 
proof that she had taken advantage of her position in committing the 
crime.
[17]
 Instead, she was convicted of falsification under Article 172.
[18]
 


Hence, this Petition.
[19]
 


Issues 


The OSGâs Memorandum which recommended acquittal, and which petitioner adopted, raised the following issues: 




âWhether the Sandiganbayan erred in: 




[1.]             finding petitioner guilty of falsification despite its finding that no estafa was committed[;] 


[2.]             holding that Exhibit 9, a sales invoice, was a commercial/public document[; and] 


[3.]             applying the presumption that petitioner was the 
author of falsification in the absence of any proof that she benefited 
from it.â
[20]
 


This Courtâs Ruling 


The Petition is meritorious. 


First Issue: 


Nature of Complex Crimes 


Appellant was purportedly charged with the complex crime of estafa 
through falsification of a commercial document. However, even if the SBN
 itself doubted whether the Information had properly charged a complex 
crime, it was, as quoted earlier, âconstrained to go along with the 
supposition that what has been charged is that of a complex crime, 
otherwise the logical consequence is that the accused has been indicted 
with two crimes -- that of Estafa and that of Falsification of 
Commercial Document which is not beneficial to her.â
[21]
 


We clarify. Under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code,
[22]

 a complex crime refers to (1) the commission of at least two grave or 
less grave felonies that must both (or all) be the result of a single 
act, or (2) one offense must be a necessary means for committing the 
other (or others).
[23]
 
Negatively put, there is no complex crime when (1) two or more crimes 
are committed, but not by a single act; or (2) committing one crime is 
not a necessary means for committing the other (or others) .
[24]
 


Using the above guidelines, the acts attributed to petitioner in 
the present case cannot constitute a complex crime. Specifically, her 
alleged actions showing falsification of a public and/or a commercial 
document were not necessary to commit estafa. Neither were the two 
crimes the result of a single act. The OSG correctly observed: 




âx x x. The alleged falsification happened after the money was 
spent and to explain how it was expended. Thus there is no complex crime
 since the falsification is not a necessary means for committing the 
estafa (as charged) or malversation (as suggested by Sandiganbayan in 
its Order dated February 1, 2000). If at all, it was intended to conceal
 the estafa or malversation.â
[25]
 




Well-known is the principle that an information âmust charge only 
one offense, except when the law prescribes a single punishment for 
various offenses.â
[26]
 When more than one offense is charged, the accused may move to quash the information.
[27]
 


In the present case, the accused should have objected to the 
Information on the ground that more than one offense was charged 
therein. For her failure to move to quash the indictments, she is deemed
 to have waived her right to be tried for only one crime.
[28]

 Furthermore, she did not object to the submission of evidence that 
tended to prove the offenses charged in the Information -- estafa and 
falsification. Verily, when two or more offenses are charged in a single
 complaint or information, but the accused fail to object to the defect 
before trial, the trial court may convict them of as many offenses as 
are charged and proven, and impose on them the penalty for each offense,
 setting out separately the findings of fact and law in each.
[29]
 


On the basis of the foregoing, we reject the argument of petitioner
 that since she was acquitted of estafa, she could no longer be 
convicted of falsification of a commercial document. Having, in effect, 
been charged with two distinct crimes, acquittal in one will not 
necessarily lead to acquittal in the other. Each crime will be evaluated
 based on its own merits, and conviction will depend on the proof of the
 elements of each particular offense. 


Let us assume that petitioner has correctly been charged with a 
complex crime, as the SBN supposed. Still, acquittal from a component 
offense will not necessarily lead to an acquittal from the other (or 
others). 


When a complex crime under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code is 
charged, it is axiomatic that the prosecution must allege in the 
information and prove during the trial all the elements of all the 
offenses constituting the complex crime. 


We stress that the failure of the prosecution to prove one of the 
component crimes and the acquittal arising therefrom will not 
necessarily lead to a declaration of innocence for the other crimes. 
Settled is the rule that when a complex crime is charged and the 
evidence fails to establish one of the component offenses, the defendant
 can be convicted of the others, so long as they are proved.
[30]
 


Second Issue: 


Nature of Sales Invoice 


The OSG agrees that the subject Sales Invoice is a public and/or a 
commercial document within the meaning of âfalsificationâ as defined 
under the Revised Penal Code. 


Both the OSG and the OSP agree that a private document acquires the
 character of a public document when it becomes part of an official 
record and is certified by a public officer duly authorized by law.
[31]
 The OSP aptly explained this point as follows: 




âx x x, [I]f the document is intended by law to be part of the 
public or official record, the preparation of which being in accordance 
with the rules and regulations issued by the government, the 
falsification of that document, although it was a private document at 
the time of its falsification, is regarded as falsification of public or
 official document. 


âProsecution witness Luz Co testified that the duplicate original
 of Sales Invoice No. 21568 was submitted to the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue (BIR). Thus this Sales Invoice is intended to be part of the 
public records and the preparation thereof is required by BIR rules and 
regulations. Moreover, Sales Invoice No. 21568 formed part of the 
official records of PAGCOR when it was submitted by petitioner as one of
 the supporting papers for the liquidation of her accountability to 
PAGCOR.â
[32]
 




Neither can it be denied that the Sales Invoice is also a 
commercial document. Commercial documents or papers are those used by 
merchants or businessmen to promote or facilitate trade or credit 
transactions.
[33]
 This Court has previously characterized such documents in this wise: 




âx x x. In most cases, these commercial forms [receipts, order 
slips and invoices] are not always fully accomplished to contain all the
 necessary information describing the whole business transaction. The 
sales clerks merely indicate a description and the price of each item 
sold without bothering to fill up all the available spaces in the 
particular receipt or invoice, and without proper regard for any legal 
repercussion for such neglect. Certainly, it would not hurt if 
businessmen and traders would strive to make the receipts and invoices 
they issue complete, as far as practicable, in material particulars. 
These documents are not mere scraps of paper bereft of probative value 
but vital pieces of evidence of commercial transactions. They are 
written memorials of the details of the consummation of contracts.â
[34]
 (Italics supplied) 




Third Issue: 


Proof of Guilt 


The gut issue in this case is whether the prosecution was able to 
prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of petitioner with regard to the
 crime of falsification. A determination of this question will 
necessarily require an examination of the facts as presented before the 
Sandiganbayan. 


As a rule, an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court raises only questions of law.
[35]

 However, this Court, in exceptional cases, has taken cognizance of 
questions of fact in order to resolve legal issues. This is especially 
true in cases in which a palpable error or a grave misapprehension of 
facts was committed by the lower court.
[36]

 Criminal cases elevated by public officials from the SBN deserve the 
same thorough treatment by this Court as criminal cases brought up by 
ordinary citizens, simply because the constitutional presumption of 
innocence must be overcome by proof beyond reasonable doubt in both 
instances. Indeed, in a criminal case, a personâs life or liberty is at 
stake.
[37]
 


Petitioner asserts that the SBN erroneously applied the presumption
 that the possessor of a forged or falsified document who uses it is the
 author of the forgery or falsification. The OSG concurs with her on 
this point. That is why it recommended that she be acquitted. 


We agree. To our mind, the prosecutionâs evidence is not sufficient
 to convict. As correctly observed by the OSG, the Decision of the SBN 
is based on the assumption that there was only one set of sales invoices
 issued by Sanford Hardware. On such a premise, petitionerâs Exhibit 9 
thus becomes obviously falsified when compared with respondentâs Exhibit
 D-1. But on the premise that the two Exhibits are two different Sales 
Invoices, falsification becomes doubtful. The OSG is correct in 
observing as follows: 




âx x x. For petitioner or anybody acting on her behalf to falsify
 the customerâs copy of Sales Invoice No. 21568, she/he would have to 
erase or cover with correction fluid the spaces pertaining to the name 
of the customer, date, quantity, unit, description of articles, unit 
price and amount, before the insertions could be written. Neither the 
appealed decision nor the transcript of stenographic notes (TSN) point 
out various tell-tale signs of falsification despite opportunity of the 
prosecution to see the original of Exh. 9. The only observation the 
respondent Court mentioned was with respect to the date: â[t]he 
superimposition of January 17, 1991 is too apparent to be disregarded, 
and the alteration of the date has affected both the veracity and the 
effects of the said document.â But the changing of the date was the 
easiest to accomplish. The more cumbersome, as they affect wider space, 
would [have been] the name of the customer and the purchases. The total 
absence of any hint or sign of alteration on these areas is revealing.â
[38]
 




The only logical explanation for the existence of both Exhibits 9 
and D- 1 is that there are two extant documents. Whether one is the 
original and the other is falsified depends on the proof. This the 
prosecution had to prove, but unfortunately failed to. In all criminal 
prosecutions, without regard to the nature of the defense which the 
accused may raise, the burden of proof establishing the guilt of the 
accused beyond reasonable doubt remains with the prosecution.
[39]
 Further, it is the duty of the prosecution to prove each and every element of the crime charged in the information.
[40]

 We repeat that, in this case, it failed to discharge this duty. We 
quote with approval the OSGâs disquisition on these two documents as 
follows: 




âA comparison between Exh. D-1 and Exh. 9 shows that there are 
two (2) sets of Sales Invoice No. 21568. While the form is identical in 
most respects, there are three (3) telling differences: (1) the type set
 of the sales invoice numbers are different, (2) the bottom left of Exh.
 D-1 indicates the name of the printing press while no such information 
is indicated anywhere in Exh. 9, and (3) the bottom right of Exh. D-1 
states the BIR permit which does not appear in Exh. 9. Who could have 
printed Exh. 9 is anybodyâs guess. It is possible that petitioner or any
 person acting on her behalf had a printing company copy this particular
 Sanford Hardware invoice so she could use it to liquidate the PAGCOR 
funds she received. However, it is equally possible that Sanford 
Hardware had printed two (2) sets of the same receipts, one to reflect 
the real business transaction, the other one - a sanitized version - for
 the consumption of the BIR people. Not one of these possibilities has 
been actually proven, 
but neither was their improbability established.â
[41]
 (Italics supplied) 




Indeed, the OSG points out that there are material differences 
between Exhibits 9 and D-1. These include: 1) the discrepancy in the 
âtype setâ or fonts used for the sales invoice numbers in the two Sales 
Invoices; 2) the presence of the name of the printing press at the 
bottom left corner of Exhibit D-1 and its absence in Exhibit 9; and 3) 
the presence of the BIR permit in Exhibit D-1 and its absence in Exhibit
 9. It is possible that Exhibit 9 was printed by petitioner or anyone 
acting on her behalf to facilitate the liquidation of funds. But it is 
equally possible, as the OSG points out, that Sanford Hardware caused 
the printing of two sets of receipts to serve its own purposes. However,
 none of these possibilities was either actually proven or definitely 
ruled out by the prosecution. At bottom, there is no clear and 
convincing evidence to prove that Exhibit 9 was falsified. 


The SBN relied on the settled rule that in the absence of a 
satisfactory explanation, one found in possession of -- and who used, 
took advantage of or profited from -- a forged or falsified document is 
the author of the falsification and is therefore guilty of 
falsification.


 To convict petitioner of falsification would mean that the 
prosecution was able to establish that Exhibit 9 was a falsified copy of
 an original document. But the rule itself shows that it cannot be 
applied to the present case, because Exhibit 9 (Sales Invoice No 21568) 
was not established beyond reasonable doubt to have been forged or 
falsified. At the very least, it may be a second document that may or 
may not have been printed by petitioner herself. 


Respondent claims that the original document is Exhibit D-1 but, as
 adverted to earlier, Exhibit 9 was not satisfactorily demonstrated to 
be a copy thereof. In other words, Exhibit 9 being different from 
Exhibit D-1, the prosecution cannot be deemed to have presented an 
original document, of which Exhibit 9 is a falsified copy. 


The question is: who made this second document marked Exhibit 9? 
Petitioner consistently maintains that Exhibit 9 was issued to her by 
Sanford Hardware when she purchased the items mentioned therein. On the 
other hand, the manager of Sanford Hardware denies having issued such 
document. Indeed, it is a time-honored principle
[42]

 that greater probative value is accorded to a positive than to a 
negative testimony. Furthermore, as correctly pointed out by the OSG:




âx x x [Petitioner] denied the accusation and insisted that she 
would not sacrifice her name and reputation for the meager amount 
involved. She submitted photographs that the lighting of alleys in 
Barangay 124 was completed. There was positive testimony by Alfonso Cua,
 one of the persons who installed the articles listed in Sales Invoice 
No. 21568. The prosecution failed to rebut these.â
[43]
 (Citations omitted) 




One final point. The SBN held that the âaccused refused to present 
the original of Exhibit 9,â and that it would have been so âeasy x x x 
to ask for a subpoena to direct x x x the PAGCOR to produce the original
 copy, and yet the accused satisfied herself in presenting Exhibit 9 -- a
 mere xerox copy of the supposed document.â But, as pointed out by the 
OSG in its Memorandum,
[44]
 the original of Exhibit 9 was presented in court during the November 5, 1996 hearing after a subpoena 
duces tecum

 had been issued to PAGCOR, and Prosecutor Pimentel âconfirmed that the x
 x x xerox copies are faithful reproductions of the original.â
[45]
 


In all criminal cases, mere speculations cannot substitute for proof in establishing the guilt of the accused.
[46]

 Indeed, suspicion no matter how strong must never sway judgment. Where 
there is reasonable doubt, the accused must be acquitted even though 
their innocence may not have been established. The Constitution presumes
 a person innocent until proven guilty by proof beyond reasonable doubt.
 When guilt is not proven with moral certainty, it has been our policy 
of long standing that the presumption of innocence must be favored, and 
exoneration granted as a matter of right.
[47]
 


Although the evidence for the defense may be frail, criminal 
conviction must come, not from its weakness, but from the strength of 
that for the prosecution.
