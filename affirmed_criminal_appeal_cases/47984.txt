PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. CARLITO MARAHAY Y MORACA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


For automatic review is the Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 19, Catarman, Northern Samar, in Criminal Cases Nos. 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, and 1969 convicting Carlito Marahay y Moraca, accused-appellant, of five counts of rape and sentencing him to suffer death for each count, and to pay each of the victims, AAA and BBB, the amounts of P50,000.00 as moral damages and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, in each case.
Initially, on November 24, 1994, Provincial Prosecutor Romeo M. Resuello of Catarman, Northern Samar, filed with the RTC two Informations charging accused-appellant with rape, thus:
Criminal Case No. 1964
âThat on or about the 24
th

Northern Samar
, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with lewd design, and with force, intimidation and threats to kill, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously embrace, kiss and finger AAA, a 12-year old girl and own daughter of accused, after which said accused succeeded in having sexual intercourse with his daughter AAA against her will and consent.

âCONTRARY TO LAW.â
[2]
Subsequently, or on November 29, 1994, 
Amalia P. Marahay
, mother of AAA and BBB, filed with the same court three amended complaints, charging accused-appellant with an additional three counts of rape which read:
Criminal Case No. 1967
âThat on or about the 26
th
 day of August, 1994, at more or less 3:00 oâclock in the morning at Sitio

, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously with force and intimidation, succeeded in having sexual intercourse with his daughter BBB against the will and consent of the latter.
âCONTRARY TO LAW.â
[5]
When arraigned on December 2, 1994, accused-appellant Carlito Marahay pleaded not guilty to all five charges of rape.
[6]
During the pre-trial, the prosecution and the defense stipulated that accused-appellant and complainant 
Amalia Marahay
 are legally married and that BBB and AAA are their legitimate children.
[7]
 Thereafter, joint trial of the cases ensued.
The Solicitor General, in the appelleeâs brief, summarized the theory of the prosecution as follows:
âThis is a case of rape by the father of his fourteen-year old and twelve-year old daughters.
âBBB is a fourteen-year old girl and a high school freshman while AAA is aged twelve and a fourth-grader. BBB and AAA are the eldest and second eldest, respectively, of six (6) siblings. They have three (3) sisters aged ten, eight, and four and a six-year old brother. Their parents are 
Amalia
 and Carlito Marahay, the latter being the appellant himself. BBB and AAA live with their family in a house in Barangay 
Bantayan
, Municipality of 
San Roque
, Province of 
Northern Samar
 (TSN, December 5, 1994, pp. 2 and 11; December 6, 1994, pp. 8-9)
âOn August 24, 1994, BBB and AAA accompanied appellant to their farm in Sitio 
Pangi
 where they were to make copra (TSN, December 6, 1994, pp. 7-9). At the farm, they had supper at 6:30 in the evening and went to sleep at 7:00 oâclock. They lay on the floor with the appellant between BBB and AAA (TSN, December 5, 1994, p. 12). BBB awoke to find the appellant pinching her. He placed himself on top of BBB, then kissed and embraced her while removing her shorts and panty (
Ibid
., pp. 12-13). Appellant then exposed his penis from his brief and inserted it into BBBâs organ causing her to suffer intense pain. He continued in that position until he ejaculated on the mat (
Ibid
., pp. 13-15). He again placed his organ against her vagina but BBB started to kick appellant while crying at the same time. AAA saw what was happening and cried (
Ibid
., p. 15). Appellant turned and placed himself on top of her. He disrobed AAA in the same manner as he did with BBB but could only penetrate her slightly as AAA kept on crying (TSN, December 6, 1994, pp. 5-6). So he inserted his pointing finger in her organ and made a push and pull movement with it (
Ibid
., pp. 6-7). He again placed his organ inside her vagina but then pulled it out as she jerked backward in pain and cried (
Ibid
., pp. 7-8). All this time appellant was pinning her arms against the floor and threatening to kill her (
Ibid
., p. 8). Nearby, BBB just lay and cried. She could not sleep right away because of what happened (TSN, December 5, 1994, p. 16). At about 3:00 oâclock of the following morning, BBB was again sexually assaulted by appellant (
Ibid
., p. 19). Again that evening, appellant had sexual intercourse twice with BBB (
Ibid
., pp. 19-20). Scared that they would be killed by appellant, the girls kept to themselves the ordeal they suffered (
Ibid
., p. 20). Meanwhile, appellant continued molesting BBB everytime he saw her alone in the kitchen by touching and fondling her breast. Because of this, BBB informed her mother 
Amalia
 of what appellant did to them at the farm (
Ibid
., p. 21).
âWhen AAA was examined by the municipal health officer of San Roque, Northern Samar in the person of Dr. Warren Octadoy, she was described as having a healed laceration of the hymen located at the eleven oâclock position which may be due to sexual intercourse, among other causes (TSN, December 5, 1994, pp. 2-6). In the case of BBB, there were noted healed hymenal lacerations located at the four, six and eight oâclock positions consistent with the insertion of a penis, according to Dr. Lydia Quilatan, acting assistant provincial health officer of the Northern Samar Provincial Hospital (TSN, Decmebr 6, 1994, pp. 10-14).â
[8]
The defense presented accused-appellant as its sole witness. He testified that his wife 
Amalia
 fabricated the rape charges against him. She constantly reproached him for not being rich and for her inability to continue working, being married to him. Their marriage is characteristically unstable due to her habitual drinking and her jealous fits. In 1982, they separated. In 1992, she reconciled with him so that he would continue to support their children. They all reside in Barangay 
Bantayan, San Roque, Northern Samar
.
[9]
On August 24, 1994, accused-appellant asked his wife to accompany him to Sitio 
Pangi
 to harvest copra. She refused, suggesting that he bring his daughters instead. Hence, BBB and AAA went with him to Sitio 
Pangi
 and stayed at a farmhouse for the night. While they were lying down, his daughter, BBB, informed him that his wife has a paramour. Suddenly, he felt that his âmind became confusedâ and âthe devil possessed him.â He claimed he âforgot all around himâ and then he sexually assaulted her. BBB said nothing and did not resist him. Accused-appellant further claimed that when they had sexual intercourse that night, âthe devil possessed both of them.â The next day, or on August 25, 1994, they returned to their house in Barangay 
Bantayan
.
[10]
Accused-appellant denied having any sexual contact with BBB anytime thereafter since he was bothered by his conscience. He asserted that the three additional indictments of rape allegedly committed by him against BBB were filed by his wife in order to fortify the case against him.
[11]
He also denied touching or raping his other daughter, AAA, and reiterated that such charge was concocted by his wife.
[12]
On January 11, 1995, the trial court rendered its Joint Decision,
[13]
 the dispositive portion of which reads:
âWHEREFORE, the Court finds Carlito Marahay y Moraca GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of rape, defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659 as indicated in the specifications and is hereby sentenced as follows:
âIn Criminal Case No. C-1964, to suffer the extreme penalty of death and indemnify AAA by way of moral and exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00 and P30,000.00, respectively;
âIn each Criminal Cases Nos. C-1965, C-1967, C-1968 and C-1969, to suffer the extreme penalty of death and to indemnify BBB in the amounts of P50,000.00 and P30,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages, respectively.
âThe accused shall also pay the costs hereof.
âSO ORDERED.â
[14]
Accused-appellant, in his brief, ascribes to the trial court the following errors:
ââ¦IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED FOR RAPE IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 1964 EVEN IF THE EVIDENCE RELATES TO ANOTHER CRIME.
ââ¦IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED IN CRIMINAL CASES NOS. 1965, 1967 AND 1969 DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
ââ¦IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED IN CRIM. CASE NO. 1968 DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME.
ââ¦IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIES OF BBB AND AAA DESPITE A SHOWING THAT THEY WERE COACHED OR INFLUENCED WITNESSES.â
[15]
Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, defines the crime of rape, as follows:
âArticle 335. 
When and how rape is committed
. â Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
 By using force or intimidation;
 When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and
 When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.â
In determining the guilt or innocence of the accused in rape cases, this Court is guided by three principles: (a) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult for the complainant to prove but more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove; (b) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand and fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.
[16]
To recall, Criminal Cases Nos. 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1969 refer to four charges of rape committed by accused-appellant against his daughter, BBB. The other criminal case (Criminal Case No. 1964) involves accused-appellantâs sexual assault on his other daughter, AAA.
With regard to Criminal Case No. 1968, alleged to be the first rape committed by accused-appellant on August 24, 1994, BBB testified as follows:

Q:

[17]
 
 
As can be gleaned from the above statements, BBB clearly described how accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of her and what she felt during those harrowing moments. Her positive and categorical testimony deserves credence.
Corroborating BBBâs testimony is the accused-appellant himself, who admitted that he sexually assaulted his daughter BBB while she laid beside him inside the farmhouse. He blamed âthe devilâ who âpossessedâ him as he took off the shorts and panty of his eldest daughter. He âforgot all aroundâ him as he inserted his exposed penis into her vagina. He satisfied his lust on his own flesh and blood. He claims, however, that he committed this sexual atrocity only once.
Accused-appellant harps on the fact that the element of force or intimidation was not established. He contends that his daughter did not resist his sexual assault. Nor did she seek help from her sister AAA, then sleeping nearby.
We are not persuaded. BBBâs testimony unmistakably shows that she struggled to repel her fatherâs sexual advances but his strength proved too much for her. Obviously, in cases of incestuous rape, the perpetrator generally takes full advantage of his blood relationship, ascendancy, and influence over his victim, both to commit the sexual assault and to intimidate the victim into silence.
[18]
 The instant case is no exception. There is no question that accused-appellant exercised moral ascendancy over his daughter. BBB at that time could not rouse her sister from sleep. BBB also admitted that after accused-appellant raped her, she could not escape from the farmhouse as she was so frightened of him. In fact, she could not tell her mother of her ordeal, mindful of the serious threats to their lives.
[19]
 It was only several days later that she mustered enough courage to inform her mother of what her father did to her.
The records show that BBB was in tears while narrating in court her fatherâs monstrous acts.
[20]
 Indeed, when the victim says that she has been violated, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed.
[21]
 No woman, especially one of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts and thereafter expose herself to a public trial, if she were not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished.
[22]
 It is against human nature for a girl to fabricate a story that would expose herself as well as her family to a lifetime of dishonor, especially when her charge could mean the death of her own father.
[23]
We disagree, however, with the trial courtâs conclusion that accused-appellant must likewise be liable for the three other counts of rape against BBB. We stress that every charge of rape is a separate and distinct crime and each must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
[24]
In Criminal Cases Nos. 1965 and 1969, the allegations in the informations declared that BBB was raped on August 25, 1994, at 7:00 oâclock in the evening and at 3:00 oâclock in the morning. However, BBBâs testimony regarding the commission of these two other felonies failed to satisfy the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt that would justify the conviction of accused-appellant. We cite the relevant portions of her testimony, as follows:
 
 
 
âQ: 
That evening of August 25, 1994, were you ever awakened?
 
 
A:
No, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
You slept the whole night of August 25, 1994?
 
 
A:
No, sir, because on August 25, 1994, something happened.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
What was it that happened?
 
 
A:
Papa did the same thing to me.
 
 
 
 
 
 
xxx     xxx     xxx
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
What did your father really do to you?
 
 
A:
He again used me.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
How many times did your father use you that evening of August 25, 1994?
 
 
A:
Two times.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
About what time was that when your father had sexual intercourse with you?
 
 
A:
About 3:00 oâclock early in the morning of August 25.
 
 
 
 
 
 
xxx     xxx     xxx
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Court)
 
 
 
Q:
That 7:00 oâclock of August 25, what did your father do exactly?
 
 
A:
He did the same thing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Fiscal)
 
 
 
Q:
What is that 7:00 oâclock of August 25, evening or morning?
 
 
A:
Evening.â
[25]
 
 
Thus, when asked what occurred on the evening of August 25, 1994, BBB merely replied that her father âdid the same thingâ to her.
[26]
 When prodded to specify the acts done to her, she stated that her father âused herâ. No other detail was evoked from her to show the attendant elements that constitute rape, the crime charged. Such bare statements cannot suffice to establish accused-appellantâs guilt with the required quantum of evidence.
Worse, the prosecution utterly neglected to propound questions to prove that accused-appellant indeed raped the victim in the early morning of August 25, 1994. It is essential on the part of the prosecution to establish, by the necessary quantum of proof, the elements of rape for each indictment. 
[27]
In Criminal Case No. 1967, the prosecution based its charge on BBBâs claim that her father succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her on August 26, 1994, at 3:00 oâclock in the morning. On the witness stand, BBB merely testified thus:
 
 
 
âQ:
What happened next after that assault of 7:00 in the evening of August 25, 1994?
 
 
A:
Early morning of August 26 about 3:00 in the morning.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
Early morning of August 26, this time what did your father actually do to you?
 
 
A:
He again inserted his penis inside my vagina.â
[28]
 
 
Again, we find such single statement to be inadequate. The prosecution should have conducted a further inquiry as to the circumstances surrounding the victimâs response. We reiterate that each and every charge of rape is a separate and distinct crime so that each of the other rape charged should be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
[29]
From the foregoing findings, accused-appellant can only be convicted of one count of rape against BBB, that which has been duly alleged and proved.
[30]
We now examine Criminal Case No. 1964. The information alleges that on August 24, 1994, accused-appellant kissed and inserted his finger into the vagina of his daughter AAA. Thereafter, he had sexual intercourse with her against her will and consent.
AAAâs testimony says it all, thus:
 
 
 
âQ:
What happened, if any, in the evening of August 24, 1994, at about 7:00 oâclock in the evening?
 
 
A:
I was awakened that he was already on top of me. (witness is crying while testifying)
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
Who was on top of you?
 
 
A:
Papa.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
When he was on top of you, what was he doing, if any?
 
 
A:
He had his penis out.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
Why, what was he wearing on that time?
 
 
A:
He was wearing a long pants during the daytime and on the evening he wore short pants.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
What did he do when his penis was out?
 
 
A:
He placed his penis in my vagina.

Q:
What were you wearing at that time?
 
 
A:

Q:
What others?
 
 
A:
Short pants.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
Underwears?
 
 
A:

A:

Q:
You were wearing panty?
 
 
A:
I had.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
What happened to your short pants and your panty when your father was on top of you?
 
 
A:
They were taken off towards my feet.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
Can you tell us why is it that your short pants and panty were already towards your feet?
 
 
A:
Because he (Papa) took them off.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
How did he take them off?
 
 
A:
He used his hands to take them off up to my knees only and from my knees he used his foot already in taking them off.

Q:
What did you do, if any, when your short pants and panty were taken off by your father?

(Court)
 
 
 
Q:
Why were you crying since your hands were free to do anything?
 
 
A:
I went on struggling but I could not do anything because he was stronger than me and he warned that he will kill us.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Proceed
 
 
 
(Fiscal)
 
 
 
Q:
You made mention that at the time when he took out his penis and placed it into your vagina, what else did he do, if any?

From the above-stated testimony, accused-appellantâs intention to consummate his carnal desire was clear. When he felt too much resistance from the victim upon insertion of his penis into her vagina, he instead forcefully thrust his finger inside his daughterâs vaginal opening. Moments later, he penetrated her again with his male organ and she cried in extreme pain as he pierced through her womanhood.
We give credence to AAAâs consistent, trustworthy and candid testimony. It is sufficient to warrant a judgment of conviction.
[32]
 Since her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused-appellant may be convicted on the basis thereof.
[33]
Thus, insofar as AAA is concerned, accused-appellant is liable for one count of rape committed on August 24, 1994.
Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, penalizes the crime of rape, as follows:
âThe crime of rape shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.
x x x     x x x     x x x
âThe death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
 when the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
x x x     x x x     x x xâ
We have previously declared that the special circumstances introduced by RA No. 7659, including the above-mentioned circumstance, that sanction the automatic imposition of the death penalty, partake of the nature of qualifying circumstances. These circumstances increase the penalty for rape by one degree.
[34]
 However, both the circumstances of minority and relationship must be alleged in the information and proven during trial to warrant the imposition of the death penalty.
[35]
While the father-daughter relationship of accused-appellant and the victims, BBB and AAA, remains undisputed, the minority of the victims, though alleged, was not satisfactorily established. It is the burden of the prosecution to prove with certainty the fact that the victim was below 18 years of age when the rape was committed in order to justify the imposition of the death penalty.
[36]
In the recent case of 
People vs. Manuel Pruna y Ramirez or Erman Pruna y Ramirez
,
[37]
 this Court laid down the following guidelines in appreciating age, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance:
â1.  The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.
â2. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents such as baptismal certificate and school records which show the date of birth of the victim would suffice to prove age.
â3. If the certificate of live bright or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victimâs mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:
If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;
If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 12 years old;
If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 18 years old.
â4. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victimâs mother or relatives concerning the victimâs age, the complainantâs testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.
â5. It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against him.
â6. The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim.â
Thus, although the defense does not contest the age of the victim, it is still essential that the prosecution present independent proof thereof, pursuant to No. 5 of said guidelines. As a matter of fact, the minority of the victim must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself.
[38]
 Under Section 44, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence, a birth certificate is the best evidence of a personâs date of birth.
[39]
 In the instant case, the prosecution did not present the certificates of live birth of both BBB and AAA or other similar authentic documents to prove their ages. Not even the victimsâ mother or the victims themselves, or any other relative qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree, were presented by the prosecution to establish the victimsâ ages at the time the crimes were committed. Such failure of the prosecution to discharge its burden constrains this Court to hold that the qualifying circumstance of minority cannot be appreciated in these cases.
In sum, accused-appellant should only be convicted of two counts of simple rape. The penalty for each count should only be 
reclusion perpetua
, not death.
[40]
As to damages, it must be stressed that moral damages are awarded in rape cases without need of proof other than the fact of the rape itself because it is assumed that the victim has suffered moral injuries entitling her to such an award.
[41]
 We find the trial courtâs award of P50,000.00 as moral damages to each victim in each case to be in order.
The trial court erred in not awarding civil indemnity to the victims in each case, the same being mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape.
[42]
 This Court awards each of the victims the sum of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity.
The trial court awarded P30,000.00 as exemplary damages. In line with our ruling in 
People vs. Catubig
,
[43]
 wherein the exemplary damages of P25,000.00 was awarded because the aggravating circumstance of relationship in the commission of rape was duly alleged and established,
[44]
 we reduce the trial courtâs award to P25,000.00.
