These cases were consolidated and jointly tried. Upon arraignment, Ramos pleaded not guilty to all counts of rape.
As directed by the trial court, its social worker conducted a case study on the minor victim, AAA, the victimâs family and environment and on such other matters relevant to the proper disposition of the case.
The Pre-Trial Order for the cases contained the following stipulations and admissions:
that the court has acquired jurisdiction over the offense charged and over the person of the accused;
the identity of the accused Adel Ramos y Abellana [who] is the same person present in court and that his true name is that appearing on the criminal information; and
the fact that the minor private complainant (AAA) was brought to Camp Crame for medical examination.
[5]
At the trial, the prosecution presented four (4) witnesses: (1) AAA; (2) BBB, AAAâs mother; (3) Police Chief Inspector Marianne S. Ebdane (P/Chief Insp. Ebdane), Philippine National Police Medico-Legal Officer and Child Protection Specialist; and (4) Roselyn Abunal (Roselyn), AAAâs friend and confidant.
On the witness stand, AAA recounted that the first incident of rape occurred on 17 July 2007 when she slept over at Ramosâ house upon the invitation of the latterâs daughter and AAAâs friend, Jocelyn Ramosâ (Jocelyn). AAA and her family resided next door in a house leased to them by Ramos.
In the early hours of that day, 3:00 a.m., AAA woke up and went to the comfort room to urinate. About to step out of the comfort room, she was surprised to see Ramos who blocked her way, suddenly pushed her inside, pointed a gun at her side, and told her to be quiet. Ramos threatened to kill her and evict her family from their house, so she silently acquiesced.
Ramos ordered AAA to undress and lie on the bathroom floor; he then mounted AAA and penetrated her twice. Once sated, Ramos instructed AAA to wear her clothes and return to bed. AAA narrated that she sustained bloodstains on her panty and shorts and fell ill for about a week. She was terrified and thus, spoke to no one and nothing of what had befallen her.
Unwittingly, BBB sent her daughter to her second rape â on an errand, giving Ramos another opportunity to ravage AAA.
One day between the first rape on 17 July 2007 and the last one on 29 January 2008, at noon, BBB asked AAA to bring viand to Ramosâ house. AAA was at the door and called for someone to get the food she had brought with her. A male voice asked her to place the food on the table, so AAA entered the house, placed the food and hurried to get out of the house. Unfortunately, however, Ramos pulled AAA back inside the house.
Trapped once more inside Ramosâ house, AAA immediately saw that she and Ramos were again alone. At this point, Ramos again threatened AAA and ordered her to undress. Ramos then removed his shorts and for the second time, Ramos raped AAA. Like before, AAA was terrified, left Ramosâ house and kept mum about this second rape.
The third incident took place sometime in August 2007 when AAA went to Ramosâ house to return Jocelynâs things. AAA thought no one was at Ramosâ house since no one came to the door despite her knocking. Despite her prior experience, she decided to go inside the house and just leave Jocelynâs things. AAA was once again surprised by Ramos who was inside the house. The experience was repeated, Ramos pulled her and told her to remove her shorts. Ramos kissed AAA on the neck, fondled her, and ultimately succeeded in raping her for the third time. AAA, the whole time, just silently cried. As in the past assaults, AAA kept the ordeal to herself.
The fourth and final incident took place at around 3:00 a.m. of 29 January 2008. AAA went to the comfort room outside of their house and was startled see Ramos already inside. Similar to the previous occasions, Ramos threatened AAA to keep silent and told her to remove all her clothes. This time, Ramos lifted one of AAAâs legs, shoved her against the wall and penetrated her while standing up.
Three days later, AAA broke her silence and told her best friend, Roselyn about Ramosâ sexual assaults. Upon Roselynâs urging, AAA revealed all to her mother who brought her to the Women and Children Protection Desk at the Las PiÃ±as Police Station the following day.
At Camp Crame, Quezon City, P/Chief Insp. Ebdane conducted the medical examination of AAA:
x x x [AAA] has a deep-healed laceration at 6 oâclock position which means that the laceration cannot be dated accurately since it is healed but there is clear evidence that there is a blunt penetrating trauma; AAAâs claim, as stated on the sexual crime protocol, that she was raped on 17 July 2007 is consistent with [the] findings in [the] medico-legal report; during [the] medical examination, AAA was coherent; there were no other abnormal findings, and no abnormalities on the external genitalia; the general physical examination was normal and there were no physical injuries except for the genital finding; AAA was not crying at the time of her medical examination; and AAA was accompanied at that time by her mother. Dr. Ebdane identified the Medico-Legal Report No. R08-244 dated 08 February 2008.
x x x AAAâs deep-healed laceration could also be caused by consensual sex; a blunt force or penetrating trauma could be caused by a finger, penis or a ballpen; the trauma could also be self-inflicted by using oneâs finger ; a deep healed laceration cannot be dated accurately; a deep-healed laceration is more than twenty-one (21) days; the blunt force or penetrating trauma sustained by AAA was not caused just recently at the time of the examination on 02 February 2008 because the laceration is already healed; according to AAA she has not sexual relationship and that it was the accused who is the perpetrator; and AAA told her that she was raped for the first time on 17 July 2007 and that the last time was on 29 January 2008 at x x x, Las PiÃ±as City.
[6]
Meanwhile, based on the Social Case Study Report filed on June 8, 2008 by the courtâs social worker, the trial court issued an Order on the same day directing the parents of AAA to bring her to the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) for psychiatric evaluation and treatment. The trial court likewise directed the NCMH to submit a report thereon.
As expected, the defense painted a different story: Ramos simply denied all charges of rape and countered with rhetorical questions and scenarios to assail the prosecutionâs evidence:
1.  On the first incident, AAA did not sleep over and was accompanied by his daughter back to AAAâs house while Ramos held their household dogs at bay to stop them from running after AAA. These dogs are usually near the comfort room and would bark at strangers in their house. Moreover, their house, 4 x 4 meters in size, is made of thin wood, without divisions, where all members of his household slept near the comfort room. In all, Ramos could not have raped AAA without being heard by other occupants of his house.
2.  As for the circumstances surrounding the other incidents of rape, Ramos simply proffered instances of his kindness and generosity to AAAâs family ranging from stopping AAAâs parents from fighting to allowing AAAâs family to pay house rentals on installment.
3.  On raping AAA while in a standing position as recounted in the fourth and final rape charge, Ramos pointed out that he was taller than AAA which renders it impossible for him to rape the latter at such position.
4.  If he had indeed raped AAA, then she and her family would have lodged a complaint at the first occurrence thereof.
Ramosâ testimony was corroborated by his wife and daughter, Vergie and Joandel Ramos.
As adverted to, the trial court found Ramos guilty of four (4) counts of rape:
WHEREFORE, the court finds the accused 
ADEL RAMOS y ABELLANA
, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for Four (4) counts or Rape under Criminal Informations Nos. 08-0281, 08-0282, 08-0283 and 08-0284 (penalized under Article 266-A Revised Penal Code in relation to Republic Act 7610), and hereby sentence (sic) to suffer a penalty of 
RECLUSION PERPETUA
 for each of the aforesaid cases with the accessory penalty as provided for by law.
This court likewise directs the accused ADEL RAMOS Y ABELLANA to indemnify the victim âAAAâ FITY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity 
ex-delicto
, another FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) as moral damages and another TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P25,000.00) as exemplary damages for each of the aforesaid cases.
The awards of civil indemnity and moral damages [are] in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence. Civil indemnity, actually given as actual or compensatory damages, is awarded upon the finding that rape was committed. Similarly, moral damages are awarded to rape victims without need of pleading or evidentiary basis because the law assumes that a rape victim suffered moral injuries entitling her to the award.
[7]
On Notice of Appeal, the appellate court affirmed the trial courtâs finding of guilt on four (4) counts of rape. However, the Court of Appeals increased the award of exemplary damages for each count of rape and specified that all awards for civil indemnity, moral and exemplary damages shall bear interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of the decision:
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the appeal is 
DENIED
. The Decision dated 27 January 2010 of the Regional Trial Court of Las PiÃ±as City, Branch 199 in 
Crim. Cases Nos. 08-0281, 08-0282, 08-0283, 08-0284
 finding accused-appellant Adel Ramos y Abellana guilty beyond reasonable doubt of four (4) counts of rape under Article 266-A, par. 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended; sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 for each count of rape, and ordering him to pay the victim AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages for 
each
 count of rape, is 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION 
in that the trial courtâs award of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages to be paid by accused-appellant to AAA is hereby increased to P30,000.00 for 
each
 count of rape, and that
 ALL
 the awards for civil indemnity, and moral and exemplary damages shall bear interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum 
from the date of finality of this Decision.
[8]
Hence, this appeal on the sole issue of whether Ramos raped AAA on four (4) separate occasions.
As the lower courtsâ have ruled, we likewise find that Ramos had carnal knowledge of AAA through force, threat and intimidation, on all four (4) occasions.
We affirm both courtsâ uniform findings that Ramos repeatedly raped AAA in four (4) separate instances in a span of seven (7) months.
Articles 266-A
, paragraph 1(a), and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code enumerate how rape is committed and the penalty therefor:
ART. 266-A
. 
Rape, When and How Committed
. â Rape is committed â
1. By a man who shall have 
carnal knowledge
 of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
a. Through 
force, threat or intimidation
;
x x x x
ART. 266-B.
 
Penalties.
 â Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.
The appellate court affirmed the trial courtâs disquisition finding the testimony of AAA, straightforward and categorical, that she had been raped by Ramos,
 i.e.
, Ramos had carnal knowledge of AAA, through force, threat and intimidation.
First.
 Both the lower courts correctly gave credence to AAAâs testimony, which was personally observed by the trial judge. On more than one occasion, we have held that in a prosecution for rape, the accused may be convicted solely on the basis of the testimony of the victim that is credible, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.
[9]
 As in this case, the final resolution of the issue turns on the credibility of the victim.
In the review of rape cases, we continue to be guided by the following principles: (1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant is scrutinized with extreme caution; and, (3) the evidence for the prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the defense.
[10]
 Thus, in a prosecution for rape, the complainant's credibility becomes the single most important issue.
[11]
Moreover, we have consistently held that the testimony of minor victims is normally given full weight and credit. When a woman states that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed.
[12]
 AAA was still a minor when the rape occurred and her testimony was found by the lower courts to be a straightforward and categorical account of all the incidents, notwithstanding her youth and innocence.
As the lower courts have noted, we find AAAâs testimony credible; she remained steadfast and never wavered in her claim that Ramos raped her, as she recounted the harrowing ordeal repeated four (4) times:

He told me to wear my clothes and to go out, sir.
 
 
 
Q: 
 
Did he threaten you?
 
 
 
A: 
 
He threatened me that he will kill me and my parents if I will talk about the incident, sir.

AAAâs testimony is corroborated by the medical finding evincing forcible defloration, which taken together, provide sufficient basis to conclude that the essential requisites of carnal knowledge through force, threat and intimidation have been established.
On the whole, the prosecutionâs evidence, consisting of AAAâs testimony, the result of the medical examination conducted on AAA, the Social Case Study Report, even without delving into AAAâs fainting episode during the trial proceedings, establish in all aspects, physical and emotional, the sexual assault by Ramos on AAA.
In stark contrast, Ramos makes a wholesale denial of the four (4) instances of rape and throws rhetorical questions that are irrelevant to the gravamen of the crime of rape and its specific details testified to by AAA.
Ramos claims that AAA did not employ even the slightest amount of resistance as she did not push him away or attempt to shout. He further avers that during the first incident when he supposedly poked a gun at AAA, it was unusual that AAA remained passive under attack and went back to sleep in Ramosâ house after having been sexually assaulted.
The supposed observations do not disprove rape.
To begin with, tenacious resistance against rape is not required; neither is a determined or a persistent physical struggle on the part of the victim necessary.
[14]
 It is well-settled that the force contemplated by law in the commission of rape is relative, depending on the age, size and strength of the parties.
[15]
AAA was a minor of small stature â 4â10 in height, whereas Ramos was 50-years-old at the time â 5â6 in height. For AAA, resistance would have been futile when taking into consideration the significant age and height differences between her and Ramos.
And Ramosâ very argument about AAA being poked with a gun but remaining pliant illustrates vividly Ramosâ exploitation of AAAâs youth that made it easy to cow her into submission. Any person, even socially labeled alpha males, more so a minor female, may very well be seared away by a pointed gun.
Next, Ramos casts doubt on the credibility of AAA by insisting that AAA could have easily escaped during the second and third incidents but did not, nor did she even try to shout for help. In addition, he argues that her visits to his house twice a week thereafter and her carelessly going to his house make it hard to believe that AAA was subjected to anything against her will.
We once more disagree.
Failure to cry for help or attempt to escape during the rape is not fatal to the charge of rape; it does not make voluntary AAAâs submission to appellantâs lust.
[16]
 Rape through intimidation includes the moral kind such as the fear caused by threatening the girl with a knife or pistol.
[17]
In this case, Ramosâ gun and continual threats were enough to make AAA cower in fear. Thus, the lower courts did not err in finding that Ramos employed enough force and intimidation to consummate his purpose in mind.
[18]
 And as correctly held by the trial court, the fact that she was able to sleep after the first incident of rape is a trivial matter and does not affect the positive and categorical testimony of AAA about the rape.
[19]
With respect to AAAâs ostensible carelessness for returning to Ramosâ house even after she was raped, Ramos insinuates that such is not the normal actuation of a woman who had been previously raped and is in fear of being raped again.
There is no established singular reaction to rape by all victims of this crime against persons. Indeed, AAA may have been naÃ¯ve in returning to Ramosâ house after Ramos raped her. However, naivetÃ© is not equivalent to consensual sex and cannot erase the rape committed against AAA by Ramos.
AAA sufficiently explained why she went to the house of the appellant, to wit:
 
 
A: 
 
Because my other siblings are not capable of going on errands and also his daughter was outside, so I was the one who put the things inside the house, Your Honor.
 
 
 
x x x x
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
Ms. Witness, was there a time that you came to like the accused raping you?
 
 
 
A: 
 
No, sir.
 
 
 
x x x x
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
Tell us your reason why do you have to go to the house of the accused?
 
 
 
A:
 
 
Because of his teenage daughter, Your Honor. Weâre inviting each other.
 
 
 
Q: 
 
And what do you usually do whenever you go to the house of the accused?
 
 
 
A: 
 
Me and his teenage daughter are talking to each other, Your Honor.
[20]
 
 
In the appellantâs brief, Ramos belatedly asserts that AAA is sexually promiscuous, who cohabited with her boyfriend soon after the criminal charges against Ramos were lodged, and was impregnated thereafter.
We reject this defense as a clear afterthought. In any event, we have previously ruled that even those with unchaste character may be a victim of rape.
[21]
 Thus, Ramosâ strategy in attacking AAAâs character falters as a defense.
Then, too, Ramos is ensnared by his conflicting assertions. He would say that AAA consented to the sexual intercourse, there being no proof of force, threat and intimidation. Yet, he likewise claims that he did not have sexual intercourse with AAA because it was allegedly impossible to do so at the comfort room in his house.
Ramos next posits that the delay of seven (7) months before AAA revealed the rape to her mother belied her claim of sexual assault.
We cannot subscribe to Ramosâ reasoning.
Delay in reporting a rape to the police authorities does not negate its occurrence nor does it affect the credibility of the victim. In the face of constant threats of violence and death, not just on the victim but extending to her kin, a victim may be excused for tarrying in reporting her ravishment.
[22]
 In this case, AAA consistently claims that on all occasions of the rape, Ramos threatened her with death and eviction from home. Hence, apart from the embarrassment and shame that, if unjustifiably, goes with being raped, it is quite understandable for a minor to be hesitant or disinclined to come out in public and relate a painful and horrible experience of sexual violation.
[23]
Significantly, while the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are supported by direct evidence, the evidence of the defense consist in bare allegations that were easily dismissed by the lower courts.
For instance, Ramos testified that the presence of dogs and the cramped space in the comfort room precludes rape. However, no rule exists that rape can be committed only in seclusion.
[24]
 And while usually, rape is committed in relative isolation or even secrecy,
[25]
 we have found, in other instances, that venues of rape vary and sometimes include inside a house where there were other occupants,
[26]
 and even in a small room where other family members also sleep.
[27]
 Certainly, we are not wont to sustain Ramosâ defense that there were other members of his household sleeping inside the house who would have heard him while he raped AAA, or that the house had no division which discourages the commission of rape.
We quote with favor the appellate courtâs assessment of the prosecutionâs and the defenseâs respective evidence:
Against a deluge of inculpatory evidence from the prosecution, all that accused-appellant could muster was his defense of denial. He testified, 
inter alia,
 that: AAA was lying; it was not possible for him to have raped her because of the dogs barking whenever there were strangers at their house; there was even a dog near the toilet, which just gave birth, and was fierce and kept on barking; and it was impossible for him to rape AAA while standing because of the height disparity; AAA did not sleep in their house on 17 July 2007 as his daughter accompanied her out of the house; and his family was also at the house. What can be gleaned from his testimony is that accused-appellant does not question the fact that he was at the 
locus criminis
 when the rape incidents happened.
Self-serving statements cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of a credible witness on affirmative matters. Time-tested is the rule that between the positive assertion of prosecution witnesses and the negative averment of an accused, the former undisputedly deserves more credence and is entitled to greater evidentiary value. As it has been oft pronounced, both denial and 
alibi
 are inherently weak defenses which cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of the prosecution witness that [Ramos] was the author of the crime charged.
For the crime of rape to be committed, it is not necessary for the place to be ideal or the weather to be fine, for rapists bear no respect for locale and time when they carry out their evil deed. In numerous cases, it has been held that rape can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the roadside, in school premises, in a house where there are other occupants, in the same room where other member of the family are also sleeping and even in places which to many would appear unlikely and high risk venues for its commission. Besides, there is no rule that rape can be committed only in seclusion. Indeed, lust is no respecter of time and place.
[28]
Turning now to the imposable penalty, the lower courts correctly sentenced Ramos to 
reclusion perpetua 
for each count of rape, totaling four.
[29]
As for the lower courtsâ award of civil indemnity and damages, (P50,000.00 for each count of rape and P50,000.00 as moral damages also for each count of rape), they differed in the amount of exemplary damages awarded which the appellate court increased from P25,000.00 to P30,000.00.
We affirm all of the lower courtsâ awards for each count of rape in the following amounts: (1) P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, (2) P50,000.00 as moral damages, and (3) P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.
The awards of civil indemnity and moral damages of P50,000.00 for each count of rape are proper given the number of times Ramos raped AAA, took advantage of her minority and the proximity of the places where they resided.
We further affirm the appellate courtâs increase in the award of exemplary damages to P30,000.00, even nary an aggravating circumstance attending the rape of AAA, based on the main provision of Article 2229
[30]
 of the Civil Code and not just on Article 2230
[31]
 thereof.
Exemplary damages are intended to deter serious wrong doings, and to serve as vindication of undue sufferings and wanton invasion of the rights of an injured or a punishment for those guilty of outrageous conduct.
[32]
 They may be awarded when circumstances of the case show the highly reprehensible or outrageous conduct of the offender. On more than one occasion, we have awarded exemplary damages to set a public example, to serve as deterrent to elders who abuse and corrupt the youth, and to protect the latter from sexual abuse.
[33]
In this case, we cannot overemphasize that AAA was a minor when Ramos raped her on four (4) separate occasions. This was aggravated by the fact that on the first incident thereof, Ramos threatened her with a gun, a deadly weapon. All told, the award of exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00 for each count of rape is in order.
Lastly, we sustain the appellate courtâs specification that all awards for civil indemnity, and moral and exemplary damages shall bear interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment thereof.
