PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. VINSON BRIONES Y ABANICA, APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




PER CURIAM:


For automatic review by this Court is the judgment
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna (Branch 31), dated September 22, 1999, finding Vinson Briones y Abanica guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping his minor daughter. The decretal portion of the decision reads as follows:  
 âWHEREFORE, the Court hereby renders judgment sentencing accused Vinson Briones y Abanica to suffer the penalty of death, to pay the private complainant Lenny Briones the sums of P100,000 as civil indemnity and P50,000 as moral damages and to pay the costs of suit.  
 âSO ORDERED.â
[2]
 The Solicitor General summarizes the evidence for the prosecution thusly:  
 âPrivate complainant Lenny Briones y Sullestre is the daughter of accused-appellant Vinzon Briones y Abanica. Her mother is Divina Sullestre. She last saw her mother when she was 12 years old and was in Grade VI. Her father (accused-appellant) is a living-out-prisoner at the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City and has a live-in partner by the name of Jenny OrdoÃ±a.  
 âLenny was living with accused-appellant at Brgy. Riverside, San Pedro, Laguna. However, since her father (accused-appellant) seldom went home to Brgy. Riverside because of the latterâs nature of work, Lenny stayed with her stepmother at Balimbing Drive, NBP Reservation, Muntinlupa City.  
 âOn September 5, 1998, Lenny went to her stepmotherâs house in Muntinlupa. She saw her stepmother and accused-appellant quarrelling. Then on that same day she was fetched by accused-appellant from her stepmotherâs house, and brought to the latterâs one-room house at Brgy. Riverside at San Pedro, Laguna where they slept.  
 âAround 4:00 oâclock in the morning of the following day, September 6, 1998 while Lenny was sleeping beside accused-appellant, she was awakened when the latter embraced and kissed her on her cheek. He also touched and mashed her entire body. Then afterwards she was undressed by accused-appellant. After her shorts and panty were removed, he started kissing and touching her body. She was crying, struggling and kicked him. But accused-appellant held her thighs and arms and kissed her private parts.  
 âWhile lying down face up, accused-appellant placed himself on top of her, removed his brief, and made a push and pull motion while mashing her body and breast; then he sat and shook his private organ. He then put a pillow on her buttocks and again placed himself on top of her and made a push and pull movement. While struggling and crying, she begged for pity but she was even choked and threatened by accused-appellant instead. Accused-appellant continued with his push and pull movements, and she felt weak and her body ached. She also felt pain in her private part everytime he forced his private organ into her private parts.  
 âIt was already dawn on the following day when appeIlant stopped abusing her and slept. In the morning of September 6, 1998, he left her. While putting on her panty, she noticed contusion on her thighs and private parts caused by accused-appellant during the struggle. Complainant went to her stepmother in Muntinlupa City.  
 âShe did not immediately tell anybody what happened to her. It was a week after the incident that she decided to tell it to Jennifer, the daughter of her stepmother. Jennifer, accompanied her to their neighbor to complain. On October 5, 1998, she was brought to the National Bureau of Investigation for examination and before the police investigator she filed a complaint against accused-appellant.â
[3]
 (Citations omitted)
 On the other hand, appellant raises the defense of denial. He avers that âon September 5, 1998 at around 5:00 p.m., he was engaged in a drinking spree with his landlord in Muntinlupa City. At 11:00 p.m., he went to his house at Brgy. Riverside, San Pedro, Laguna and slept there. He woke up at 6:00 oâclock the following morning. He learned that he was charged for having raped his minor daughter Lenny only on October 5, 1998 when he was detained at the municipal jail after his arrest. He did not react upon learning about the charge x x x because he was too drunk and cannot remember what happened on September 6, 1998.â
[4]
 The information against the appellant was filed on April 23, 1999. It reads as follows:  
 âThat on or about September 6, 1998, in the Municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, have carnal knowledge with his own 16-year-old daughter LENNY S. BRIONES, by means of force and intimidation and against her will, to the latter damage and prejudice.â
[5]
 When arraigned on May 13, 1999, the appellant, assisted by Atty. Jerry BaÃ±ares, pleaded ânot guilty.â
[6]
The trial court found that the prosecution had duly established the rape of the minor Lenny Briones by her own father. It ruled that the findings of the medico-legal officer had not negated the commission of rape. It gave full faith and credit to Lennyâs simple and straightforward testimony.
 In his Brief, the appellant argues that 
âTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT JUST GUILTY OF ATTEMPTED RAPE.â
[7]
  
 The appellant says that the testimony of Lenny Briones is not credible. He contends that complete penetration of her vagina by an adult male organ was negated by the absence of hymenal laceration and by the fact that her hymen, which was not elastic or extendible, was still intact.
 Time and again, the Court has held that appellate courts will not disturb the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses by the trial court. Having observed their deportment and manner of testifying, the court a quo was in a better position to weigh conflicting testimonies. This rule stands, unless the trial judge overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if considered, might affect the result of the case.
[8]
 In the present case, we find no cogent reason to disturb the finding of the trial court regarding the credibility of the complainant Lenny Briones.
In many cases the Court has found the existence of the crime of rape even in the absence of complete or total penetration. The slightest penetration of the vagina is enough to consummate the crime of rape. In the present case, Lenny Briones testified on the fact of penetration as follows:

[9]
The foregoing positive and categorical testimony of the complainant bears the earmarks of truth. It sufficiently establishes the force employed on her by the appellant as well as the partial penetration of her vagina by his penis and, hence, the consummation of the crime of rape.  
 Furthermore, a daughter would not accuse her own father of a serious offense like rape, had she really not been aggrieved.
[10]
 Her testimony against him is entitled to greater weight, since reverence and respect for elders is too deeply ingrained in Filipino children and is even recognized by law.
[11]
 The rule is that when the victim says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed. If her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof. This principle is all the more true where the complainant is the daughter of the accused. That she would accuse her own father of this heinous crime had she not been aggrieved would be absurd.
[12]
 We have consistently stressed that the absence of hymenal lacerations does not negate rape; conversely their presence is not an element of it.
[13]
 Thus, a conviction for rape may be sustained even in their absence.
[14]
In the alternative, the appellant also argues that he should be found guilty only of attempted rape, not consummated rape, since there was no complete penetration by his sex organ.
 The contention has no merit. The evidence shows that part of the appellantâs penis entered the complainantâs vagina. The entry of the penis even just into the aperture of the female organ, thereby touching the labia of the pudendum, already consummates the crime of rape.
[15]
 We now go to defense of denial resorted to by the appellant. In the absence of corroborative evidence, the Court cannot accept his lame denial over Lennyâs straightforward and positive declaration. Between the positive and categorical testimony of a rape victim on one hand and the accusedâs bare denial on the other, the former generally prevails.
[16]
  Universally accepted is the rule that denial is a self-serving negative evidence that cannot be given greater weight than the declaration of a credible witness who testifies on affirmative matters.
[17]
 The circumstances of father-daughter relationship between the appellant and the complainant and the minority of the latter were duly alleged in the information and proven beyond reasonable doubt by the presentation of the complainantâs birth certificate.
[18]
 Hence, the court a quo correctly found him guilty of qualified rape. Its imposition of the death penalty
[19]
 on him must be affirmed.
 Further, the court a quo correctly awarded to the complainant moral damages of P50,000. However, its award of P100,000 as civil indemnity is reduced to P75,000, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.
[20]
 In addition, exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000 should also awarded to her in view of her proven relationship to the appellant.
[21]
 In sum, we affirm the Decision of the RTC finding the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified rape and imposing the death penalty on him.
[22]
 Indubitably, when the victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is a parent, the court has no option but to apply the penalty of death.
[23]
 
WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna, Branch 31, in Criminal Case No. 1093-SPL, finding Vinzon Briones y Abanica guilty of qualified rape and sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of death is 
AFFIRMED
  with the 
MODIFICATION
  that the appellant shall pay the victim, Lenny Briones, the amount of P75,000 as civil indemnity ex delicto and P25,000 as exemplary damages, in addition to the P50,000 moral damages awarded by the trial court. Costs against appellant. 
 In accordance with Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659, upon finality of this Decision, let the records of these cases be forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of executive clemency.
