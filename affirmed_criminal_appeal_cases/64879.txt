PERLAS-BERNABE, J.:


Assailed in this ordinary appeal
[1]
 is the Decision
[2]
 dated January 30, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09056, which affirmed the Judgment
[3]
 dated February 20, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 79 (RTC) in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-14-11237- CR finding accused-appellant Brenda CamiÃ±as y Aming (CamiÃ±as) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,
[4]
 otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."
The Facts
This case stemmed from an Information
[5]
 filed before the RTC charging CamiÃ±as with the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165. The prosecution alleged that on the evening of November 4, 2014, operatives of the District Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operation Task Group of the Quezon City Police District (DAID-SOTG), in coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, conducted a buy-bust operation against CamiÃ±as, during which ten (10) plastic sachets containing a total of 43.34 grams
[6]
 of white crystalline substance were recovered from her. Afterwards, they immediately marked, inventoried, and photographed the seized items at the place of arrest in the presence of CamiÃ±as, Barangay Kagawad Dennis Chico (Kagawad Chico), and Media Representative Alfred Oresto (Oresto). The seized items were then brought to the crime laboratory, where, after examination,
[7]
 the contents thereof yielded positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride or 
shabu
, a dangerous drug.
[8]
In defense, CamiÃ±as denied the charges against her, claiming that on the date of the incident, she bought a cellular phone at SM North, and while waiting for a taxi going to Greenhills, San Juan, two (2) men who identified themselves as policemen forcibly boarded her in a vehicle. They then brought her to Jollibee, where she was shown the items allegedly confiscated from her. Afterwards, the policemen demanded the amount of P180,000.00 for her immediate release; otherwise, a case would be filed against her. They likewise confiscated her bag which contained her personal belongings and some cash. Thereafter, she was brought to the DAID-SOTG, where she was detained for two (2) days without food.
[9]
In a Judgment
[10]
 dated February 20, 2017, the RTC found CamiÃ±as guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, and accordingly, sentenced her to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.
[11]
 It ruled that the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved.
[12]
 Aggrieved, CamiÃ±as appealed
[13]
 to the CA.
In a Decision
[14]
 dated January 30, 2018, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling.
[15]
 It ruled that the integrity of the seized items remained unscathed since PO2 Jeriel Jarez Trinidad (PO2 Trinidad) was in custody of the seized items from the time it was recovered from CamiÃ±as up to the time it was delivered to Police Chief Inspector Anamelisa Sebido Bacani (PCI Bacani), Forensic Chemist, for laboratory examination, who, in turn, delivered the seized items to Evidence Custodian Junia Ducad (Evidence Custodian Ducad) for safekeeping.
[16]
Hence, this appeal seeking that CamiÃ±as's conviction be overturned.
The Court's Ruling
The appeal is without merit.
The elements of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 are: (
a
) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (
b
) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.
[17]
 Here, the courts 
a quo
 correctly found that CamiÃ±as committed the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, as the records clearly show that she was caught 
in flagrante delicto
 selling 
shabu
 to the poseur-buyer, PO2 Trinidad, during a legitimate buy-bust operation conducted by the DAIDÂ­SOTG. Since there is no indication that the said courts overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, the Court finds no reason to deviate from their factual findings. In this regard, it should be noted that the trial court was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties.
[18]
Further, the Court notes that the buy-bust team had sufficiently complied with the chain of custody rule under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.
In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165, it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the 
corpus delicti
 of the crime.
[19]
 Failing to prove the integrity of the 
corpus delicti
 renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, hence, warrants an acquittal.
[20]
To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.
[21]
 As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, 
inter alia
, that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same.
[22]
 The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (
a
) if 
prior
 to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,
[23]
 a representative from the media 
AND
 the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official;
[24]
 or (
b
) if 
after
 the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service 
OR
 the media.
[25]
 The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."
[26]
In this case, it is glaring from the records that after CamiÃ±as was arrested, the buy-bust team immediately took custody of the seized items. They likewise conducted the marking, inventory,
[27]
 and photography
[28]
 of the seized items at the place of arrest in the presence of an elected public official, 
i.e.
, Kagawad Chico and a media representative, 
i.e.
, Oresto, in conformity with the amended witness requirement under RA 10640. PO2 Trinidad then secured the seized items and personally delivered the same to PCI Bacani of the Quezon City Police District Crime laboratory for laboratory examination, who in turn, brought the specimen to Evidence Custodian Ducad for safekeeping.
[29]
 In view of the foregoing, the Court holds that there is sufficient compliance with the chain of custody rule and, thus, the integrity and evidentiary value of the 
corpus delicti
 have been preserved. Perforce, CamiÃ±as's conviction must stand.
WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
DISMISSED
. The Decision dated January 30, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09056 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
. Accused-appellant Brenda CamiÃ±as y Aming is found 
GUILTY
 beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, as amended by Republic Act No. 10640, and accordingly, sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.

[22]
 In this regard, case law recognizes that "marking upon immediate confiscation contemplates even marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team." (People v. Mamalumpon, 767 Phil. 845, 855 [2015], citing 
Imson v. People
, 669 Phil. 262, 270-271 [2011]. See also 
People v. Ocfemia
, 718 Phil. 330, 348 [2013], citing 
People v. Resurreccion
, 618 Phil. 520, 532 [2009].) Hence, the failure to immediately mark the confiscated items at the place of arrest neither renders them inadmissible in evidence nor impairs the integrity of the seized drugs, as the conduct of marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team is sufficient compliance with the rules on chain of custody. (See People v. Tumulak, 791 Phil. 148, 160-161 [2016] and 
People v. Rollo
, 757 Phil. 346, 357 [2015].)
