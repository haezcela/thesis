VITUG, J.:


For review before the Court is the decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 73, of Antipolo City, finding appellant Bobby Orense guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of statutory rape against his own daughter, Grace Anne R. Orense, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death.
The information, dated 31 March 1997, averred â
âThat on or about the 2
nd
 day of March 1997, in the Municipality of Antipolo, Province of Rizal, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one Grace Anne Orense, who is his own daughter, a minor three (3) years of age, against her will and consent.â
[2]
When arraigned, appellant Bobby Orense pled ânot guiltyâ to the charge; whereupon, trial on the merits commenced.
The case for the prosecution.
  â
The prosecution presented five witnesses, namely: complainant-victim Grace Anne R. Orense; her mother Noralyn A. Ramos; examining physician Tomas D. Suguitan; Dr. Olga M. Bausa, who compared the blood samples of the complainant with the bloodstains found on the âsandoâ shirt of appellant; and Dr. Norieta Calma-Balderama, a psychiatrist.
Grace Anne identified her father, appellant Bobby Orense, in open court.  She testified that her father, whom she curtly called â
bastos
,â did something bad to her and that she prayed that âher father be sent to jail.â  She said that she had seen the penis of appellant which he had inserted into her vagina several times.  When she bled, appellant wiped the blood off with his shirt and then licked her private parts.  When asked about her age, she answered that she was four years old.
Noralyn Ramos Orense, mother of Grace Anne, confirmed being married to appellant Bobby Orense, their marriage twice solemnized, on 08 March 1988
[3]
 and on 16 April 1988,
[4]
 and that complainant Grace Anne was born on 08 October 1993 per her birth certificate.
[5]
 The family lived in Coconut Street, FEU Village, 
Brgy
. Mambungan, Antipolo, Rizal.  Noralyn was not home in the afternoon of 02 March 1997.  Returning home at six oâclock that evening, she noticed that Grace Anne was unusually quiet (
matamlay
).  Around noontime the following day, Grace Anne, who just had a bowel movement, complained of pains in her private parts while Noralyn was giving her a bath.  It was then when she learned for the first time of the rape incident.  For about a week, Noralyn had the same observation whenever she would give Grace Anne a bath.  Grace Anne also complained of frequent stomach pains and difficulty in urinating.  The matter prompted Noralyn to call the âhotlineâ of 
Bantay Bata
[6]
 where she was told to have her child examined by a medico-legal officer.  She and Grace Anne proceeded to the Sto. NiÃ±o de San Antonio Maternity and General Hospital.  She was advised to have the child undergo urinalysis.  Dr. D. S. Sta. Ana, a pathologist, with the assistance of medical technologist Editha A. Santos, conducted the urinalysis and found Grace Anne to be suffering from urinary tract infection.  Dr. Tomas D. Suguitan, a medico-legal officer, examined Grace Anne and found her to be a non-virgin.
On 24 March 1997, Noralyn went to the Rizal CIG Provincial Office, Karangalan Village, in Cainta, Rizal, to execute a sworn statement
[7]
 on the rape perpetrated by appellant.  When apprehended, appellant told Noralyn that he would agree to leave the house and financially support them provided she would drop the charge against him.  Noralyn declined.  Appellant was detained at the Antipolo Municipal Jail.  Since Grace Anne continued to have nightmares, Noralyn brought her daughter to the Child Protection Unit of the Philippine General Hospital for psychiatric treatment.
Dr. Sta. Ana and Editha A. Santos of the Sto. NiÃ±o De San Antonio Maternity and General Hospital in Marcos Highway, Barrio de la Paz, Pasig City, undertook urinalysis on Grace Anne.  The report,

Dr. Tomas D. Suguitan, Police Senior Inspector and Medico-Legal Officer of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory Group in Camp Crame, Quezon City, examined Grace Anne.  Medico-Legal Report No. M-1058-97,
[9]
 dated 20 March 1997, yielded the following findings; 
viz
:
âPURPOSE OF LABORATORY EXAMINATION:
To determine physical signs of sexual abuse.
âFINDINGS:
"
GENERAL AND EXTRAGENITAL
:
Fairly developed, fairly nourished and coherent female child.  Breasts are undeveloped.  Abdomen is flat and soft.
â
GENITAL
:
There is absence of pubic hair.  Labia majora are full, convex and coaptated with the pinkish brown labia minora presenting in between.  On separating the same disclosed an elastic, fleshy-type hymen with shallow healed laceration at 9 oâclock position.  External vaginal orifice admits tip of the examinerâs smallest finger.
âCONCLUSION:
Subject is in non-virgin state physically.
There are no external signs of application of any form of violence.
âREMARKS:
Vaginal and peri-urethral smears are negative for gram-negative diplococci and for spermatozoa.â
Dr. Suguitan testified that he found a shallow healed laceration at the nine oâclock position which could have been caused by the insertion of a blunt object, such as a penis or a finger, and not merely because of a bad fall.
Dr. Olga M. Bausa, Police Senior Inspector and Medico-Legal Officer of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory Service in Camp Crame, Quezon City, compared the 2 ml. blood sample taken from Grace Anne with that of the bloodstains found on a âsandoâ shirt
[10]
 belonging to appellant.  The biochemical examination on the shirt gave positive result for the presence of human blood belonging to blood type âB.â  Medico-Legal Report No. S-233-97,
[11]
 dated 10 November 1997, showed that both specimens belong to blood type âBâ:
âSPECIMEN SUBMITTED:
Specimen A â Living person of Grace Anne R. Orense
Specimen B â One (1) sando shirt colored white with alleged bloodstains.
âPURPOSE OF LABORATORY EXAMINATION:
To determine the presence of blood, its origin and its corresponding blood type.
âFINDINGS:
Biochemical examination conducted on specimen B gave POSITIVE result to the test for the presence of human blood belonging to blood group `B.â
Blood typing conducted on the living person of Grace Anne R. Orense showed that she belong[s] to blood group `B.â
âCONCLUSION:
Specimen A belongs to human blood group `Bâ.
Specimen B revealed the presence of human blood belonging to blood group `Bâ.â
Dr. Norieta Calma-Balderama, an Adult and Child Psychiatrist of the Child Protection Unit of the Philippine General Hospital, testified that she handled the psychiatric treatment.  Dr. Balderama used the âplay and interviewâ approach in talking to Grace Anne.  During the interview, she observed that Grace Anne repeatedly said the words 
âtiti ni Papa,â âdugo,â daliri ni Papa,â
 and 
âdito hinawakanâ
 (referring to her private parts) even without being asked about the abuse.  She concluded that the girl was telling the truth.  When Grace Anne visited the center for the seventh time, she showed manifestations of one who had experienced a traumatic event.
The version of the defense
. â
Appellant Bobby Orense, testifying in his own behalf, admitted being married to Noralyn.  The couple had three children born of the marriage, namely, Angelita, Grace Anne, and Norbert.  Appellant denied having raped Grace Anne.  He claimed that at eight oâclock in the morning of 02 March 1997, he was at his fatherâs house in Blumentritt, Manila, to meet a friend who would accompany him to renew his security guard license.  By eleven oâclock in the morning, appellant was at the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in U.N. Avenue, Manila, to secure an NBI clearance which he needed for his job application.  He stayed there until two oâclock in the afternoon.  He then proceeded to Camp Crame to renew his license as a security guard and left the place at four oâclock in the afternoon.  At around six oâclock in the evening, appellant arrived home only to find his clothes in a trash can.  According to appellant, his wife did it out of anger as he was away for so long.  Appellant said that his wife treated him like a house helper and obliged him to do household chores, like washing clothes and doing the dishes, that prompted him to stay with his father at Blumentritt, Manila, for about a month prior to 02 March 1997.
The decision under review
.  â
On 24 August 2001, the court 
a quo
 rendered a decision, finding Bobby Orense guilty of statutory rape; it concluded:
âWHEREFORE, premises considered, accused Bobby Orense is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of statutory rape and is sentence[d] to suffer the penalty of death in accordance with Republic Act [No.] 7659.  The accused is also ordered to pay the victim the amount of 
P
50,000.00 as indemnity.â
[12]
In this appeal, appellant contends that the prosecution has failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
As so often said, this Court, is guided in its review of trial court decisions in rape cases by certain guidelines, 
i.e
., (1) that an accusation for rape can be made with facility; (2) that the crime is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (3) that, in view of the nature of the offense of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant is scrutinized with extreme caution; and (4) the evidence for the prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the defense.
[13]
 More frequently than not, however, the thrust of the issues focuses on the credibility of the victim.  In this respect, great reliance is made on the evaluation made by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses, particularly their demeanor, conduct, and attitude, during the direct and cross-examination by counsel.
[14]
Appellant doubts the credibility of Grace Anne, being still a child, to testify.  In 
People v. Pruna
,
[15]
 the Court has observed:
âAs a general rule, when a witness takes the witness stand, the law, on ground of public policy, presumes that he is competent.  The court cannot reject the witness in the absence of proof of his incompetency.  The burden is, therefore, upon the party objecting to the competency of a witness to establish the ground of incompetency.  (VII Vicente J. Francisco, Part I, 234 [1997 Ed.], 
citing
 Whartonâs Criminal Evidence, Section 1152 [11
th
 Ed.])
âSection 21 of Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence enumerates the persons who are disqualified to be witnesses.  Among those disqualified are â[c]hildren whose mental maturity is such as to render them incapable of perceiving the facts respecting which they are examined and relating them truthfully.â
âNo precise minimum age can be fixed at which children shall be excluded from testifying.  The intelligence, not the age, of a young child is the test of the competency as a witness.  (
Ibid
., p. 242, 
citing
 58 Am. Jur. 97.)  It is settled that a child, regardless of age, can be a competent witness if he can perceive and, in perceiving, can make known his perception to others and that he is capable of relating truthfully the facts for which he is examined.  (
People v. Librando
, 335 SCRA 232, 244 [2000].)
âIn determining the competency of a child witness, the court must consider his capacity (a) at the time the fact to be testified to occurred such that he could receive correct impressions thereof; (b) to comprehend the obligation of an oath; and (c) to relate those facts truly to the court at the time he is offered as a witness.  (2 Florenz D. Regalado, Remedial Law Compendium 608 [2001 Ed.].  
See
 also VII Francisco 243, 
citing
 Wheeler v. U.S., 159 U.S. 523.)  The examination should show that the child has some understanding of the punishment which may result from false swearing.  The requisite appreciation of consequences is disclosed where the child states that he knows that it is wrong    to tell a lie, and that he would be punished if he does so, or that he uses language which is equivalent to saying that he would be sent to hell for false swearing.  (VII Francisco 243, 
citing
 3 Jones on 
Evidence
 1296-1298.)  A child can be disqualified only if it can be shown that his mental maturity renders him incapable of perceiving facts respecting which he is being examined and of relating them truthfully.  (
People v. Virtucio
, 326 SCRA 198, 205 [2000].)
âThe question of competency of a child-witness rests primarily in the sound discretion of the trial court.  This is so because the trial judge sees the proposed witness and observes his manner of testifying, his apparent possession or lack of intelligence, as well as his understanding of the obligation of an oath.  (
People v. De la Cruz
, G.R. No. 135022, 11 July 2002, 384 SCRA 375.  
See
 also 
People v. De la Cruz
, 276 SCRA 352, 357 [1997]; 
People v. Operana
, 343 SCRA 43, 63 [2000].)  Since many of the witnessâ manners cannot be photographed into the record, the finding of the trial judge will not be disturbed or reversed unless from what is preserved it is clear that such finding was erroneous.  (
People v. De la Cruz
, G.R. No. 135022, 11 July 2002, 384 SCRA 375.)â
[16]
The complainant, despite her age, was able to respond well to questions that convinced the trial court of the victimâs competency to testify.
âPUBLIC PROSECUTOR:
Are you studying right now?
âA:   Not yet, sir.

âA:   Me.
âQ:  How did you learn that it was bad?
âA:   `Kaya ko lang natutunan iyon, nasasagot lang ako ni Mama.â

âPUBLIC PROSECUTOR:
We submit to the discretion of the Court.
âCOURT:
Swear the witness.â
[17]
Appellant suggests that the testimony of Grace Anne might have just been fabricated to suit the rape charge.  Although her story might lack vividness, her narration, nevertheless, has sufficiently described the sexual assault on her.  She testified:
âINTERPRETER:
Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth in this proceedings?
âA:   Yes, sir.
âINTERPRETER:
State your name and personal circumstances.
âA:   Grace Ann[e] Orense, five years old, and residing at Antipolo.
âPRIV. PROSECUTOR:
The testimony of the witness is being offered to prove that on March 1997, she was sexually abused and raped by her father, and to prove the other allegations in the complaint.
âPUBLIC PROSECUTOR:
May we make it of record that the private prosecutor is still authorized to handle the prosecution of this case.
âCOURT:
Proceed.
âQ:  Grace Ann[e], do you know who your father is?

âA:   Yes, sir.
âQ:  And [did] you tell your mother about this bad thing your father did to you?
âA:   Yes, sir.

âA:   Yes, sir.
âQ:  Have you seen the penis of your father?
âA:   Yes, sir.
âQ:  What did your father do when you saw his penis?
âA:   He pulled it.
âQ:  Did he put his penis in your vagina?
âA:   Yes, sir.
âQ:  How many times did he do that?
âA:   `Matagal na po.â
âQ:  What happened after your father placed his penis in your vagina?
âA:   When he placed his penis inside my vagina, he did not press it hard.  But when he placed his finger inside my vagina, he pressed it really hard.
âQ:  Did you acquire any wound as a result of the placing of the penis inside your vagina?
âA:   Yes, sir.
âQ:  Did you see any blood when you had this wound?
âA:   Yes, sir.

âA:   Yes, sir, he licked my vagina.
âPRIV. PROSECUTOR:
May I make it of record that the child even pointed to her vagina while answering.
Grace Ann[e], does your father still live with you?
âA:   Yes, sir.
âQ:  Where did your father do these things to you?
âA:   Outside, sir.
âQ:  Did he do it inside your house?
âA:   Yes, sir.
âCOURT:
Did you cry when this happened?
âA:   No, your [H]onor.
âCOURT:
Was it not painful when your father did these things to you?
âA:   It was not painful, your [H]onor.
âCOURT:
Proceed.
âPRIV. PROSECUTOR:
Do you still see your father, Grace Ann[e]?
âA:   Yes, sir.
âQ:  Do you still see him in your house?

âQ:  Is the name of the doctor, Dr. Calma?
âA:   Yes, sir.
âPRIV. PROSECUTOR:
I have no further questions.â
[18]
During cross-examination, Grace Anne also did well in maintaining her account of the incident.
âCOURT:
Cross?
âDEFENSE COUNSEL:
With the permission of the Court.
âCOURT:
Proceed.
âQ:  You said that your Papa did something `bastosâ to you, `tama ba iyon?â

âQ:  Is it not that your mother Noralyn told you that your father did something `bastosâ to you?
âA:   Yes, sir.
âQ:  Is it not that it is your mother who told you, `titi ni Papa?â
âA:   Yes, sir.
âQ:  And it was and still is your Mama Noralyn who wants your Papa to be placed in jail?
âPRIV. PROSECUTOR:
Objection, your [H]onor.
âCOURT:
Witness may answer.
âA:   `Kasi salbahe siya.â

âQ:  Do you still recall the place where you were brought to the doctor?
âA:   No, sir.
âQ:  Who brought you to Dr. Calma?
âA:   Mama.
âQ:  Only the two of you went to the doctor?
âA:   Yes, sir.
âQ:  Did your mother tell you what to tell Dr. Calma?
âA:   No, sir.
âDEFENSE COUNSEL:
That will be all for the witness.â
[19]
Far from detracting from her veracity, the minor discrepancies or lapses that might have been committed by Grace Anne, just to the contrary, would tend to bolster her testimony.
[20]
 Indeed, her narration was corroborated, not only by Noralyn Orense (Grace Anneâs mother) but, significantly, by the medical report presented by the prosecution; 
i.e
., that blood samples of Grace Anne, belonging to blood type âB,â matched with the bloodstains found in appellantâs shirt which, according to Grace Anne, appellant used to wipe off the blood from her; that the results of the urinalysis showed that Grace Anne had urinary tract infection; that the hymenal lacerations found could have been caused by the insertion of an object like a penis or a finger; and that Grace Anne showed manifestations of an abused child who had undergone a traumatic event.  The fact that there were no signs of physical violence would not militate against the occurrence of rape, proof of external injuries not being indispensable in a prosecution for rape.  Clearly, appellant took advantage of his moral ascendancy over his defenseless daughter.  Neither would the presence of spermatozoa be essential to prove rape.
[21]
The bare and uncorroborated denial of appellant and his defense of 
alibi
 cannot prevail.  Denial is an intrinsically weak defense which must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility.
[22]
 In order that 
alibi
 can prosper, not only must an accused prove his being in another place at the time of the commission of the crime, but also that it would have been impossible for him, given the circumstances, to be at the crime scene at the appointed time.
[23]
Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as so amended by Republic Act No. 7659, provides:
âART. 335.  
When and how rape is committed
.  â Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.
â1.     By using force or intimidation;
â2.     When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and
â3.     When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.
âThe crime of rape shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.
âWhenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.
âWhen by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.
âWhen the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.
âWhen by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death.
âThe death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
â1.     When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
â2.     When the victim is under the custody of the police or military authorities.

People v. Pruna
[24]
 has set forth the guidelines in the appreciation of the age of the victim, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance, 
viz
:
â1.     The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.
â2.     In the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents such as baptismal certificate and school records which show the date of birth of the victim would suffice to prove age.
â3.     If the certificate of live birth or authentic document 
is shown to have been lost or 
destroyed or otherwise unavailable
, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victimâs mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:
âa.     If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;
âb.     If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 12 years old;
âc.     If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 18 years old.
â4.      In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victimâs mother or relatives concerning the victimâs age, the complainantâs testimony will suffice 
provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused

â5.      It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party.  
The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against him
.
â6.     The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim.â
The relationship of the complainant to the appellant was sufficiently proved.  Noralyn testified having been married to appellant.  The marriage was twice celebrated, the first on 08 March 1988 at a church in Ermita, Manila and on 16 April 1988 at the San Roque De Manila Parish.  A certified true copy of the 08 March 1988 marriage certificate and a duplicate original of the one contracted on 16 April 1988 were presented in court.  After due comparison, the photocopies of these documents were duly marked, respectively, Exhibit âAâ and Exhibit âB.â  The prosecution, however, failed to satisfy the 
Pruna
 test to warrant the imposition of the death penalty.  The Certificate of Live Birth of Grace Anne presented to the court is neither an original nor a certified true copy.  When Noralyn took the witness stand, neither was an original or a certified true copy of the birth certificate shown in court to at least compare it with a bare photocopy marked as Exhibit âB.â  Most importantly, it was not shown that the authentic document had been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable required in 
Pruna
.
The civil indemnity of 
P
50,000.00 awarded by the trial court is consistent with the prevailing jurisprudence.  Additionally, moral damages of 
P
50,000.00 must be awarded for in crimes of rape it is to be assumed that the victim has suffered such damages.
[25]
 Exemplary damages of P25,000.00 must also be awarded to the victim, the daughter of appellant, as has been sanctioned in 
People v. Catubig
[26]
 pursuant to Article 2230 of the Civil Code.
WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 73, Antipolo City, finding appellant Bobby Orense guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the penalty of death is reduced to 
reclusion perpetua
 and, in addition to the 
P
50,000.00 civil indemnity awarded by the trial court, appellant is ordered to pay complainant Grace Anne R. Orense, 
P
50,000.00 moral damages and 
P
25,000.00 exemplary damages.  Costs
