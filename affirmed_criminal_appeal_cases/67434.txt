HERNANDO, J.:


This is an appeal from the September 9, 2016 
Decision
[1]
 of the
 Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 07658 which affirmed the 
June 18, 2015 Judgment
[2]
 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 64 of 
Labo, Camarines Norte convicting accused-appellant ZZZ of two (2) counts
 of Rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of
 reclusion 
perpetua
 in Criminal Case Nos. 08-1636-37. 
 ZZZ was 
charged with two (2) counts of Rape under Article 266-A of the Revised 
Penal Code (RPC) in relation to Republic Act No. 7610
[3]
 (RA 7610) in two 
Informations which read: 
 


CRIM. CASE No. 08-1636
 
 That 
sometime in the afternoon of May 3, 2008 in Brgy. 
xxxxxxxxx
, Labo, Camarines Norte, Philippines and 
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, with lewd design and motivated by bestial lust and by means of 
force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously had carnal knowledge of his 12-year old granddaughter 
AAA,
[4]
 without 
her consent, which acts debase, degrade her intrinsic worth as a child 
and is prejudicial to her growth and development, to her damage. 

 
 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[5]
 
 
CRIM. CASE No. 
08-1637
 
 That sometime in the early part of
 2008 in Brgy. 
xxxxxxxxx
, Labo, Camarines Norte, 
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above-named accused, with lewd design and motivated by bestial lust and 
by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge of his 12-year old 
granddaughter AAA, without her consent, which acts debase, degrade her 
intrinsic worth as a child and is prejudicial to her growth and 
development, to her damage. 
 
 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[6]


 
 The cases against ZZZ were initially 
archived by the trial court since the warrant for his arrest was 
returned unserved.
[7]
 He was eventually arraigned on December 6, 2011 
and pleaded not guilty to both charges.
[8]
 
 During trial, AAA testified
 that on two separate occasions in 2008, her grandfather, ZZZ, forcibly 
took her out of their house, brought her to a secluded place and raped 
her.
[9]


 AAA recounted that sometime in January to April 
2008, ZZZ forcibly brought her to a big copra kiln where, after 
undressing them both, he mounted her and inserted his penis into her 
vagina. To prevent her from screaming, accused-appellant covered her 
mouth with his hand and inserted his penis into her vagina. After he 
removed his penis from her vagina, AAA's vagina was swollen with the 
presence of blood and a white sticky substance. ZZZ gave AAA P50.00 and 
instructed her not to tell her father about the incident.
[10]
 
AAA further testified that in the afternoon of May 3, 2008, ZZZ fetched 
her from their house and dragged her towards the river. While crossing 
the river midway, AAA saw her siblings. However, ZZZ immediately covered
 her mouth to prevent her from shouting and calling their attention. As 
soon as they reached the side of the river, ZZZ undressed them both, 
mounted AAA and inserted his penis into her vagina. After he was done, 
accused-appellant once again told the victim not to report the incident 
to her father. This time, he threatened AAA with death should she inform
 her father. He also gave AAA P20.00.
[11]
 Since she could no longer 
bear the pain in her swollen vagina, AAA told her father of what ZZZ had
 done to her. AAA and her father then went to the barangay to file a 
complaint.
[12]
 AAA
 was also examined by Dr. Virginia Barasona who testified at the trial 
that her medical findings were consistent with AAA's claim of rape and 
that she had issued a medical certificate thereon.
[13]
 
 ZZZ was the 
sole witness for the defense. He claimed that he could not have raped 
his granddaughter, AAA, since he was already sixty-seven (67) years old 
in 2008 and his penis was no longer capable of erection due to a cyst 
near his inner thigh which caused chronic pain in his legs.
[14]
 
Accused-appellant further testified that on May 3, 2008 he was at his 
house which is located some distance away from AAA's family home.
[15]
 
 
On June 18, 2015, the trial court rendered its Judgment convicting ZZZ 
of the charges of rape, thus: 
 


WHEREFORE
, premised from the foregoing, and having 
found accused 
ZZZ
, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for
 two (2) counts of RAPE in relation to RA 7610, he is hereby sentenced 
to suffer the penalty of 
RECLUSION


PERPETUA
. Said accused is ordered to pay victim, AAA,
 for each count the following: 
 
 
Php50,000.00 as civil indemnity; and
Php50,000.00 as
 moral and exemplary damages.
 
 SO 
ORDERED.
[16]
 
 
 On 
appeal, ZZZ maintained his innocence and decried the trial court's 
finding of guilt despite the prosecution's failure to establish with 
particularity the date of commission of the rape and the inconsistent 
testimony of AAA.
[17]
 He argued that the trial court erred in not 
considering his defense of denial.
[18]
 In the alternative, assuming without admitting 
that he is guilty of raping his granddaughter, the penalty imposed 
should be that provided in Section S(b), Article III of RA 7610.
[19]
 
The appellate court sustained ZZZ's conviction for two counts of rape: 

 
 
WHEREFORE
, 
premises considered, the appeal is
 DENIED
. The 
Judgment dated 18 June 2015 of Branch 64, Regional Trial Court of Labo, 
Camarines, Norte in Criminal Case Nos. 08-1636 and 08-1637 is 

AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION
. 
Appellant [ZZZ] is hereby found 
GUILTY
 beyond 
reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of rape and is accordingly sentenced 
to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 without 
eligibility for parole for each count. Appellant is ordered to pay the 
private offended party as follows: P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, 
P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, also
 in each count. He is further ordered to pay interest on all damages 
awarded at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of
 finality of this judgment.
 
 
SO 
ORDERED.
[20]
 
 
 Hence, 
this appeal
[21]
 by
 ZZZ raising the same assignment of errors contained in his Appellant's 
Brief before the appellate court.
[22]
 
Our 
Ruling
 
 The appeal is bereft of merit. 

 After a careful review of the evidence and testimony
 proffered by the prosecution, we rule that the trial court and the 
appellate court were correct in their assessment of the testimonies of 
AAA and ZZZ. The accused-appellant failed to show that the lower courts 
overlooked a material fact that otherwise would change the outcome of 
the case or misunderstood a circumstance of consequence in their 
evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses. Thus, we will not 
disturb the trial court's findings of fact as affirmed by the appellate 
court. 
 Accused-appellant insists that the 
prosecution failed to sufficiently establish the date of the commission 
of the rape. In particular, accused-appellant points to the Information 
in Criminal Case No. 08-1637 which specified the date of the rape 
charged as "sometime in the early part of 2008". Accused-appellant 
counters that this "irregular designation" violates Section 11,
[23]
 Rule 110 of the Rules
 of Court. 
 This contention does not persuade. As 
correctly ruled by the appellate court, the date of commission of the 
crime is not an essential element thereof. In fact, the specific Rule 
cited by accused-appellant states that "it is not necessary to state in 
the Information the precise date the offense was committed 

except when it is a material ingredient of the 
offense
." The date of commission is not even an element of the
 crime of rape which elements are: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a 
woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under 
[18] years of age at the time of the rape; (5) the offender is a parent 
(whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) of the victim.
[24]
 
 
We fully agree with the appellate court's ruling that - 

 
 [A]n Information is valid as long
 as it distinctly states the elements of the offense and the acts or 
omission constitutive thereof. The exact date of the commission of a 
crime is not an essential element of the crime charged. In a prosecution
 for rape, the material fact or circumstance to be considered is the 
occurrence of the rape, not the time of its commission. The precise time
 of the crime has no substantial bearing on its commission. Therefore, 
it is not essential that it be alleged in the information with ultimate 
precision. 
 
 Further, it cannot be considered that 
appellant was deprived of his constitutional right to be informed of the
 nature and cause of the accusation against him. As cited in 

People v. IbaÃ±ez
, the Supreme Court previously upheld
 complaints and informations in prosecutions for rape which merely 
alleged that a rape has been committed "sometime in the month of April 
1993," for a rape which was committed in 1993; "on or about May 1998," 
for a rape committed sometime in the first week of May 1998; and 
"sometime in the month of September 1998" for a rape committed on an 
evening in September 1998. Here, the allegation in the Information that 
appellant committed rape "sometime in the early part of 2008" was 
sufficient to inform appellant that he was being charged of rape 
committed against his granddaughter. 
 
 It bears 
emphasis that objections as to the form of the complaint or information 
cannot be made for the first time on appeal. If appellant found the 
Information insufficient, he should have moved before arraignment either
 for a bill of particulars, for him to be properly informed of the exact
 date of the alleged rape; or for the quashal of the Information, on the
 ground that it did not conform with the prescribed form. As appellant 
failed to pursue either remedy, he is deemed to have waived objection to
 any formal defect in the Information.
[25]
 
 
 
 
Moreover, the alleged inconsistencies in AAA's testimony are 
understandable considering that she was still only a minor, 16 years 
old, at the time she testified before the trial court. In 

People v. Lagbo
[26]
 we explained that: 


 x x x Courts expect minor inconsistencies when a child-victim
 narrates the details of a harrowing experience like rape. Such 
inconsistencies on minor details are in fact badges of truth, candidness
 and the fact that the witness is unrehearsed. These discrepancies as to
 minor matters, irrelevant to the elements of the crime, cannot, thus, 
be considered a ground for acquittal.
[27]
 
 
 
 The 
testimony of AAA is consistent on material points. Slightly conflicting 
statements will not undermine her credibility or the veracity of her 
testimony. They in fact tend to buttress rather than impair their 
credibility as they erase any suspicion of rehearsed testimony.
[28]
 The defense was not 
able to elicit significant contradictions in the testimony of the victim
 to render such as a fabrication prodded by her father who 
accused-appellant points to as the perpetrator of the rape of AAA. Even 
under rigid cross-examination, AAA remained consistent in her testimony 
that accused-appellant, her grandfather, raped her in two separate 
instances: one, where she was forcibly brought to the copra kiln, and 
two, by the river where she had just previously seen her siblings but 
was unable to cry out to them for help. 
 Carnal 
knowledge had also been proven in two instances. It is settled 
jurisprudence that testimonies of child-victims are given full weight 
and credit, since when a woman or a girl-child says that she has been 
raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was 
indeed committed.
[29]
 The testimony of AAA sufficiently describes her
 harrowing experience in the hands of ZZZ. It bears emphasis that 
accused-appellant resorted to force, threat and intimidation to 
consummate his lust. We have consistently ruled that rape is committed 
when intimidation is used on the victim, which includes moral 
intimidation or coercion.
[30]
 We find to be unacceptable 
accused-appellant's contention that he could not have sexually abused 
AAA since he could no longer have an erection due to his old age, 67 
years old at the time of the rape, and considering the cyst near his 
inner thigh. Suffice it to state that neither of the lower courts gave 
credence to accused-appellant's unsubstantiated claim. Accused-appellant
 did not present documentary evidence such as a medical certificate 
attesting to the physical impossibility of his having an erection and 
incapacity of raping AAA. 
 In the same vein, his 
defense of denial fails to persuade Us. Denial, if unsubstantiated by 
clear and convincing evidence, is a self-serving assertion that deserves
 no weight in law, as in this case.
[31]
 Ultimately, accused-appellant's conviction was 
not primarily based on the weakness of his defense of denial and his 
attempt to shift the accusation to AAA's father as the alleged actual 
perpetrator of the rape. Rather, accused-appellant was found guilty on 
the basis of AAA's consistent and steadfast testimony, even under rigid 
cross-examination, pointing to him as the one who despoiled her honor. 

 ZZZ next insists that he should be penalized under 
Section 5, Article III of RA 7160 and for the mitigating circumstance of
 old age to be applied in his favor. 
 We disagree. 

 Notably, the trial court found accused-appellant 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of "Rape in relation to
 RA 7610". The appellate court affirmed this ruling of the trial court. 

 At this point, it must be pointed out there is a 
need to fix the error in the nomenclature of ZZZ's crime. As corrected, 
accused-appellant should be held criminally liable for two (2) counts of
 Rape under Article 266-A, Paragraph 1(a) penalized under Article 266-B 
(1) of the RPC.
[32]
 The correlation to RA 7610 is deleted. 

 
People v. Tulagan
[33]
 explains the ratio 
for this, 
viz
.: 


 Assuming that the elements of both violations of Section 5(b) 
of R.A. No. 7610 and of Article 266-A, paragraph !(a) of the RPC are 
mistakenly alleged in the same Information- e.g., carnal knowledge or 
sexual intercourse was due to "force or intimidation" with the added 
phrase of "due to coercion or influence," one of the elements of Section
 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610; or in many instances wrongfully designate the 
crime in the Information as violation of "Article 266-A, paragraph 1 (a)
 in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610," although this may be a 
ground for quashal of the Information under Section 3(f) of Rule 117 of 
the Rules of Court - and proven during the trial in a case where the 
victim who is 12 years old or under 18 did not consent to the sexual 
intercourse, the accused should still be prosecuted pursuant to the RPC,
 as amended by R.A. No. 8353, which is the more recent and special penal
 legislation that is not only consistent, but also strengthens the 
policies of R.A. No. 7610. Indeed, while 
R.A. No. 7610 is a 
special law specifically enacted to provide special protection to 
children from all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation and 
discrimination and other conditions prejudicial to their development, We
 hold that it is contrary to the legislative intent of the same law if 
the lesser penalty (
reclusion temporal
 medium to 

reclusion perpetua
) under Section 5(b) thereof would 
be imposed against the perpetrator of sexual intercourse with a child 12
 years of age or below 18.
 
 


Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) in relation to Article 266-B of 
the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 8353, is not only the more recent law, 
but also deals more particularly with all rape cases
, hence, 
its short title "
The Anti-Rape Law of 1997
." R.A. No.
 8353 upholds the policies and principles of R.A. No. 7610, and provides
 a "stronger deterrence and special protection against child abuse," as 
it imposes a more severe penalty of 
reclusion 
perpetua
 under Article 266-B of the RPC x x x 
[34]
 (Emphasis supplied.) 

 
 
 Pursuant to the foregoing, 
accused-appellant's conviction for two (2) counts of Rape under Article 
266, Paragraph 1(a) of the RPC is in order. 
 
Moreover, the crime of Qualified Rape under paragraph 1, Article 266-A 
of the RPC is penalized under Article 266-B (1), which provides that the
 death penalty shall be imposed if the victim is under 18 years of age 
and the offender, among others, is the ascendant or a relative by 
consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree. Applying RA 
9346,
[35]
 the 
appellate court correctly imposed the penalty of 
reclusion 
perpetua
 and without eligibility for parole. When 
circumstances warranting the imposition of the death penalty are present
 but the death penalty could not be imposed because of RA 9346, the 
qualification "without eligibility for parole" shall be used to qualify 

reclusion perpetua
 in order to emphasize that the 
accused should have been sentenced to death had it not been for RA No. 
9346.
[36]


 The Court recently settled in 
People v. 
Ejercito
[37]
 (
Ejercito
) that RA 
8353
[38]
 amending 
the RPC should now be uniformly applied in cases involving sexual 
intercourse committed against minors, and not Section 5 (b) of RA 7610. 
We declared that while RA 7610 has been considered as a special law that
 covers the sexual abuse of minors, RA 8353 has expanded the reach of 
our rape laws. We thus clarified that these existing rape laws should 
not only pertain to the old Article 335 of the RPC but also to the 
provision on sexual intercourse under Section 5 (b) of RA No. 7610 
which, applying the characterization in 
Quimvel v. 
People
[39]
 of a child "exploited in prostitution or 
subjected to other abuse," covers the rape of a minor. 

 
Ejercito
[40]
 instructs, thus: 

 
 It bears to emphasize that not 
only did RA 8353 re-classify the crime of Rape from being a crime 
against chastity to a crime against persons, it also provided for more 
particularized instances of rape and conjunctively, a new set of 
penalties therefor. Under RA 8353, Rape is considered committed not only
 through the traditional means of having carnal knowledge of a woman (or
 penile penetration) but also through certain lascivious acts now 
classified as rape by sexual assault: 
 


 Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. â Rape is 
committed â
 


 
1)
 
By a man who shall have carnal
 knowledge of a woman under any of the following 
circumstances:
 
 
 
 


 
 
 


a)


 
Through force, threat, or 
intimidation;
 
 


 
 
 


 
 
b)
 
When the offended party is deprived of reason or 
otherwise unconscious; 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 


c)


By means of fraudulent machination 
or grave abuse of authority; and
 


 
 


 
 
 


d)


When the offended party is under 
twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the 
circumstances mentioned above be present. 


 
 
 


 
 
 


2)


By any person who, under any of the
 circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of 
sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or 
anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal 
orifice of another person. (Emphasis supplied) 


 
 


Moreover, RA 8353 provides for new penalties for Rape that may 
be qualified under the following circumstances: 
 
 
Article 266-B. Penalty. â Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding 
article shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
. 

 
 Whenever the rape is committed with the use of a 
deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be 

reclusion perpetua
 to death. 
 
 
When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become 
insane, the penalty shall become 
reclusion perpetua
 
to death. 
 
 When the rape is attempted and a homicide
 is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall 
be
 reclusion perpetua
 to death. 
 
 
When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, homicide is committed, 
the penalty shall be death. 
 
 The death penalty shall
 also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the 
following aggravating/qualifying circumstances: 
 
 1) 

When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the 
offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by 
consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the 
common-law spouse of the parent of the victim
; 


 2) When the victim is under the custody of the police or 
military authorities or any law enforcement or penal institution; 

 
 3) When the rape is committed in full view of the 
spouse, parent, any of the children or other relatives within the third 
civil degree of consanguinity; 
 
 4) When the victim 
is a religious engaged in legitimate religious vocation or calling and 
is personally known to be such by the offender before or at the time of 
the commission of the crime; 
 
 5) When the victim is a
 child below seven (7) years old; 
 
 6) When the 
offender knows that he is afflicted with the Human Immuno-Deficiency 
Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or any other 
sexually transmissible disease and the virus or disease is transmitted 
to the victim; 
 
 7) When committed by any member of 
the Armed Forces of the Philippines or para-military units thereof or 
the Philippine National Police or any law enforcement agency or penal 
institution, when the offender took advantage of his position to 
facilitate the commission of the crime; 
 
 8) When by 
reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has suffered permanent
 physical mutilation or disability; 
 
 9) When the 
offender knew of the pregnancy of the offended party at the time of the 
commission of the crime; and
 
 10) When the offender 
knew of the mental disability, emotional disorder and/or physical 
handicap of the offended party at the time of the commission of the 
crime. 
 
 x x x x
 
 Significant to 
this case, the above-highlighted provisions of RA 8353 already accounted
 for the circumstance of minority under certain peculiar instances. The 
consequence therefore is a clear overlap with minority as an element of 
the crime of sexual intercourse against a minor under Section 5 (b) of 
RA 7610. However, as it was earlier intimated, RA 8353 is not only the 
more recent statutory enactment but more importantly, the more 
comprehensive law on rape; therefore, the Court herein clarifies that in
 cases where a minor is raped through sexual intercourse, the provisions
 of RA 8353 amending the RPC ought to prevail over Section 5 (b) of RA 
7610 although the latter also penalizes the act of sexual intercourse 
against a minor.
[41]
 
 
 
 
Finally, the damages awarded by the trial court and increased by the 
appellate court to P100,000.00 each for civil indemnity, moral damages 
and exemplary damages pursuant to 
People v. 
Gambao
,
[42]
 as well as the impostion of interest, are 
correct and consistent with the ruling in 
People v.
