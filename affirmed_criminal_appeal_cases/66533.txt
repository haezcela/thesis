Tuyor pleaded not guilty
[9]
 in all the five (5) charges. Pre-trial and trial ensued.
For the Prosecution
The facts, as established by the prosecution, and as culled from the CA Decision are as follows:
The prosecution presented as witnesses AAA
[10]
 (the victim) and Dr. Bernadette J. Madrid of the Child Protection Unit of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH). The prosecution also adduced the following evidence: 1) Exhibit "A" - AAA's Certificate of Live Birth; 2) Exhibit "B' - BBB's Certificate of Live Birth, the alleged offspring of AAA with [Tuyor]; 3) Exhibit "C" - AAA's Affidavit; 4) Exhibit "E" - Medico[-]Legal Report No. 2007-4907; 5) Exhibit F - picture of AAA taken by the Child Protection Unit of PGH.
X X X X
[Tuyor] and CCC, the mother of private complainant AAA, were live-in partners for five years. CCC had three children, including AAA, with a different man before her cohabitation with [Tuyor]. [Tuyor] and CCC have three children of their own.
AAA testified that on July 17, 2007, around 9:30 o'clock in the evening, she was inside their room will all her five siblings. At that time her mother was at work at SM City Sucat. In a while, [Tuyor] asked all her five siblings to leave the room, leaving her alone. [Tuyor] closed the door and pulled her towards the bed. He then removed AAA's colored shorts and panty and pinned her thighs with his legs. AAA struggled and asked why [Tuyor] was doing it to her but he just kept silent. She cried and fought back but she was overpowered by [Tuyor]. Thereafter, he spread her legs and inserted his penis into AAA's private parts. [Tuyor] later wiped his penis with a piece of cloth to remove the blood that came out from AAA's vagina. He likewise threatened AAA that he would kill her siblings and her mother if she told anyone about what happened. Hence, AAA kept silent and never told anyone about the incident.
Sometime in August 2007, at around 8 o'clock in the evening, AAA was inside her room sleeping when she felt that someone was on top of her. When she opened her eyes, she saw [Tuyor] naked from the waist down. Then, he covered her mouth and inserted his penis into her vagina. AAA cried and was threatened again by [Tuyor] not to tell anyone about what happened or he would kill her.
AAA was not able to narrate and testify on the third incident of rape on her direct examination for she was continuously crying.
Nevertheless, she was able to recall later that on September 29 and October 24, 2007 that she was at her room sleeping when [Tuyor] undressed her and covered her mouth. AAA was awakened when [Tuyor] inserted his penis into her vagina. Thereafter, he threatened AAA again to [
sic
] not tell anyone as to what happened or else he would kill her.
On October 26, 20-07, AAA complained of stomach cramps to her mother CCC so the latter brought her to a doctor where they found out that AAA was pregnant. AAA then told her mother that [Tuyor] had raped her several times. Thereafter, they went to the police station in 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, Cavite to file a complaint against [Tuyor]. AAA was examined by the Philippine General Hospital for medico-legal examination which showed that she suffered hymenal laceration and was indeed pregnant.
[Tuyor] was arrested by barangay officials and brought to the Bacoor police station where complaints for rape were filed against him."
[11]
For the Defense
Tuyor was given ample time to present his evidence, but he manifested through his counsel that he would no longer be presenting evidence.
RTC Ruling
On October 9, 2015, the RTC rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
ACCORDINGLY, in Criminal 
Case B-2008-767
, finding the accused Danilo Tuyor y Banderas GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Rape, he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.
He is ordered to pay AAA P50,000[.00] as civil indemnity, P50,000[.00] as moral damages and P30,000[.00]as exemplary damages and to pay the interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum on all damages awarded, to be computed from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.
In 
Criminal Case B-2008-768
, the accused Danilo Tuyor y Banderas is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Rape and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua.
He is ordered to pay AAA P50,000[.00] as civil indemnity, P50,000[.00]as moral damages and P30,000[.00] as exemplary damages and to pay the interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum on all damages awarded, to be computed from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.
In 
Criminal Case B-2008-769
, considering the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the accused is ACQUITTED of the crime charged.
In 
Criminal Case B-2008-770
, the accused Danilo Tuyor y Banderas is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Rape and sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.
He is ordered to pay AAA P50,000[.00] as civil indemnity, P50,000[.00] as moral damages and P30,000[.00] as exemplary damages and to pay the interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum on all damages awarded, to be computed from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.
In

, the accused Danilo Tuyor y Banderas is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Rape and sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.
He is ordered to pay AAA P50,000[.00] as civil indemnity, P50,000[.00] as moral damages and P30,000[.00] as exemplary damages and to pay the interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum on all damages awarded, to be computed from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.
Being a detention prisoner, the accused is credited in full of the time he had undergone preventive imprisonment.
SO ORDERED.
[12]
The RTC found AAA's testimony as categorical, straightforward, consistent and credible. AAA was able to narrate four of the five crimes of rape in detail: the act of Tuyor in inserting his private organ into hers; how she struggled to fight back against the accused; the pain she experienced during the rape; the whitish substance which came out from Tuyor; how Tuyor wiped her private part; and Tuyor's threats after the crimes of rape.
[13]
 Through AAA's narration, the RTC was fully convinced that Tuyor raped AAA. According to the court 
a quo
, Tuyor can only be convicted of the crimes of simple rape and not qualified rape. Although it was proven that AAA was a minor when the crimes of rape were committed, the relationship between AAA and Tuyor was not that of a stepfather-stepdaughter's since Tuyor was not married to AAA's mother. The special qualifying circumstance of a stepfather and stepdaughter relationship where the victim is a minor, cannot be considered in this case.
Tuyor filed his appeal with the CA. The accused-appellant Tuyor, and the plaintiff-appellee filed their respective Briefs.
CA Ruling
On December 15, 2017, the Court of Appeals issued its assailed Decision affirming accused-appellant Tuyor's conviction. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
WHEREFORE
, the instant appeal is 
DENIED
. The assailed x x x Decision dated October 9, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 89 of 
xxxxxxxxxxx
 in Criminal Cases Nos. B-2008-767, B-2008-768, B-2008-769, B-2008-770, and B-2007-771 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
 with the 
MODIFICATION
 that as to each of said cases, the civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages are increased to PhP 100,000.00 as to each award. Lastly, accused-appellant is ordered to pay interest on the amounts awarded at the legal rate of 6% per 
annum
 from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.
SO ORDERED.
[14]
The CA held that the records clearly prove that Tuyor had carnal knowledge of AAA with force, threat and intimidation and by taking advantage of his moral ascendancy over AAA, being the live-in partner of AAA's mother.
[15]
 Based on AAA's testimony, it was established that Tuyor raped her.
[16]
 The prosecution's evidence has established that Tuyor committed four counts of qualified rape against AAA, to wit: (1) the presentation of AAA's Certificate of Live Birth, which proves that she was 14 years old when the incidents of rape happened; (2) Tuyor had carnal knowledge of AAA on four separate occasions through AAA's positive, categorical, and spontaneous testimony; (3) Tuyor perpetrated the acts through force, threat or intimidation by using force and threatening to kill AAA if the latter would tell anyone about the sexual assault; and (4) AAA is the live-in partner of AAA's mother.
[17]
As regards the medico-legal report presented before the RTC, the latter gave weight and credence to it, to which the CA affirmed. There is a presumption of regularity in the performance of the government doctor's functions and duties, when Dr. Irene Baluyut issued the medico-legal report.
[18]
 Since entries in the official records made in the performance of official duty are 
prima facie
 evidence of the facts therein stated, Dr. Baluyut's findings that AAA had sexual contact and was seven weeks pregnant at that time, are conclusive in the absence of evidence proving the contrary.
[19]
 Even assuming 
arguendo
 that the medico-legal report has no evidentiary value, the prosecution has established Tuyor's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, by sufficiently proving all the elements of qualified rape.
[20]
On January 15, 2018, accused-appellant Tuyor filed his Notice of Appeal
[21]
 before the CA, on the ground that the CA Decision dated December 15, 2017 is contrary to fact, law and applicable jurisprudence.
When this appeal was instituted before this Court, the parties made their Manifestations
[22]
 that they will adopt their appellant's and appellee's Briefs, respectively, in lieu of their Supplemental Briefs.
Issues
1. Whether the CA erred in not excluding Dr. Bernadette J. Madrid's testimony for allegedly being hearsay.
2. Whether the CA erred in giving due weight and credence to AAA's testimony.
3. Whether the CA erred in convicting Tuyor guilty beyond reasonable doubt of four (4) counts of qualified rape through sexual intercourse under Article 266(A)(la), in relation to Article 266-B(1).
Tuyor faults the CA for affirming his conviction.
He argues that Dr. Madrid's testimony should have been excluded for being hearsay because she was neither present at the time the medico-legal report was made, nor was she present at the time of AAA's medical examination.
As regards AAA's testimony, Tuyor argues that AAA's failure to be consistent as to the exact date when she was allegedly raped for the second time, is fatal and should have been considered in favor of him. According to him, the RTC gave more credence to AAA's incredible testimony.
[23]
Ruling of the Court
We deny the appeal, but modify the crime committed,
[24]
 the penalty imposed, and the awarded indemnities.
After establishing that the medico-legal report shall be given weight and credence, Dr. Madrid's testimony that she is familiar with Dr. Baluyut's signature and her interpretations of Dr. Baluyut's medico-legal report, shall also be given weight and credence.
The medico-legal report shall be given weight and credence, even if the physician who examined and prepared it, was not presented in court.
First
, Dr. Baluyut's issuance of the medico-legal report falls under one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.
Under Section 44, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence, "Entries in official records made in the performance of [her] duty [as] a public officer of the Philippines, x x x are 
prima facie
 evidence of the facts therein stated."
Dr. Baluyut, a government doctor, and who by actual practice and by virtue of her oath as civil service official, is competent to examine persons and issue medico-legal reports. There is a presumption of regularity in the performance of Dr. Baluyut's functions and duties when she issued the medico-legal reports. In the absence of evidence proving the contrary, Dr. Baluyut's finding that AAA had sexual intercourse with Tuyor, and was seven weeks pregnant when she was examined, are conclusive.
Second
, when Dr. Madrid testified in court, she identified the signature of Dr. Baluyut in Medico-Legal Report No. 2007-4907, and mentioned that she is familiar with Dr. Baluyut's signature because she saw Dr. Baluyut sign a document, to wit:
Pros. Dumaual
:I am showing you a Medico[-]Legal [Rjeport prepared by Dr. Irene D. Baluy[u]t. Will you go over this document[?]. Where is the Medico[-]Legal Report that you are referring to?
Witness
:This is the one. This is the Medico[-]Legal Report No. 2007-4907 prepared by Dr. Baluy[u]t and this is her signature, sir.
 
x x x x
 
Pros. Dumaual
:And how did you come to know that is the signature of Dr. Baluy[u]t? 
Witness
 : I already saw her signing a document, sir.
[25]
Under Section 50(b), Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence, "[T]he opinion of a witness x x x may be received in evidence regarding x x x [a] handwriting with which [s]he has sufficient familiarity."
Since Dr. Madrid was familiar with Dr. Baluyut's signature, because both of them work at the Philippine General Hospital 
(PGH)
, and she saw Dr. Baluyut sign a document, Dr. Madrid's testimony with regard to Dr. Baluyut's signature is admissible as an opinion of an ordinary witness.
Third
, Dr. Madrid, a doctor from the Child Protection Unit (CPU) of the PGH, is an expert witness:
Pros. Dumaual
: Madam Witness, since when have you been a doctor of CPU-PGH?
Witness
: Since January, 1997, sir.
Pros. Dumaual
: [Doctor,] [y]ou said that you were already connected with the PGH since 1997. 
Witness
 
: Yes, sir.
Pros. Dumaual 
: And on October 26, 2007[,] how long have you been a medico legal officer?
Witness
 
: 10 years, sir.
[26]
Under Section 49 of the Rules of Evidence, "The opinion of a witness on a matter requiring special knowledge, skill, experience or training which [s]he is shown to possess, may be received in evidence."
The prosecution was able to establish Dr. Madrid's expertise in the relevant medical field. Dr. Madrid's interpretation of the entries made by Dr. Baluyut in the medico-legal report is admissible as expert testimony.
With respect to the probative value of Dr. Madrid's expert testimony, this will depend on her credibility as an expert witness and the relevance of her testimony to the issue at hand. As a rule, the trial judge's assessment of the witnesses' testimonies and findings of fact are accorded great respect on appeal.
[27]
 In the absence of any substantial reason to justify the reversal of the trial court's assessment and conclusion, like when no significant facts and circumstances are shown to have been overlooked or disregarded, the reviewing court is generally bound by the former's findings.
[28]
 The rule is even more stringently applied if the appellate court has concurred with the trial court.
[29]
Dr. Madrid testified as regards Dr. Baluyut's findings contained in the medico-legal report, to wit:
Pros. Dumaual 
: Can you tell us the case of [AAA] based on the data record? 
Witness
 
: Based on the record [AAA] appeared before Dr. Baluy[u]t on October 26, 2007 and conducted the examination and attached to the record the picture of the said victim, sir.
x x x x
Pros. Dumaual
: What can you say about the findings of Dr. Baluy[u]t to [AAA]?
Witness
 
: Based on the medical examination of Dr. Baluy[u]t that there is a definite evidence of sexual abuse on the genitalia of the victim on the 5:00 o'clock position, sir.
[30]
There is no substantial reason to justify the reversal of the RTC's assessment and conclusion on the probative value of Dr. Madrid's expert testimony. Moreso, the CA concurred with the RTC on the matter. The relevance of Dr. Madrid's testimony to the issue at hand was also established where she testified that based on the medico-legal report, AAA was sexually abused.
AAA's testimony must be given 
due weight and credence.
In determining whether AAA's testimony should be given due weight and credence, it is important to take into consideration the 
women's honor
 doctrine which states, "[the] well-known fact that women, especially Filipinos would not admit that they have been abused unless that abuse had actually happened, [because it is] their natural instinct to protect their honor,"
[31]
 borders on the fallacy of 
non-sequitur
, to wit:
[32]
xxx While the factual setting back then would have been appropriate to say it is natural for a woman to be reluctant in disclosing a sexual assault; today we simply cannot be stuck to the 
Maria Clara
 stereotype of a demure and reserved Filipino woman. We should stay away from such mindset and accept the realities of a woman's dynamic role in society today; she who has over the years transformed into a strong and confidently intelligent and beautiful person, willing to fight for her rights.
[33]
Through this, the Court can evaluate the weight and credibility of a private complainant of rape without gender bias or cultural misconception.
[34]
It is a settled rule that rape may be proven by the sole and uncorroborated testimony of the offended party, provided that her testimony is clear, positive and probable.
[35]
As a general rule, findings of facts and assessment of credibility of witnesses are matters best left to the trial court.
[36]
 Jurisprudence has set the following guidelines:
First, 
the Court gives the highest respect to the RTC's evaluation of the testimony of the witnesses
, considering its unique position in directly observing the demeanor of a witness on the stand. From its vantage point, the trial court is in the best position to determine the truthfulness of witnesses.
Second, 
absent any substantial reason which would justify the reversal of the RTC's assessments and conclusions, the reviewing court is generally bound by the lower court's findings
, particularly when no significant facts and circumstances, affecting the outcome of the case, are shown to have been overlooked or disregarded.
And third, 
the rule is even more stringently applied if the CA concurred with the RTC.
[37]
AAA's testimony with regard to the first, second, fourth and fifth counts of rape committed against her, was categorical and straightforward. There could be no substantial reason to overturn the weight given by the RTC, and as affirmed by the CA.
On the first count of rape, AAA narrated:

On the fifth incident of rape, AAA stated:

Based on AAA's testimony, the elements of rape were proven beyond reasonable doubt.
Under Article 266-A, rape is committed:
Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed.
 - x x x
1) By a man who shall have 
carnal knowledge
 of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;
xxx
Tuyor had carnal knowledge of AAA through force, threat and intimidation. AAA's positive, categorical and spontaneous testimony shows that on these four separate instances, Tuyor had inserted his penis into her vagina against her will by using force and threatening to kill AAA if she would tell anyone about the rape.
AAA's inconsistency as to the exact date of the second rape does not in itself, cast doubt on Tuyor's guilt. 
Since the essence of rape is carnal knowledge of a person through force or intimidation against that person's will,
[44]
 the precision as to the time when the rape is committed has no bearing on its commission.
[45]
Tuyor can only be convicted
with four (4) counts of simple 
rape.
Under Article 266-B of the RPC, death penalty shall be imposed in a crime of rape through sexual intercourse:
1. When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common law spouse of the parent of the victim.
In order to qualify the rape, the minority of the victim and his or her relationship with the offender should both be 
alleged in the Information and proven beyond reasonable doubt during trial
.
[46]
 The 
raison d' etre
 is that the special qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship have the effect of altering the nature of the rape and its corresponding penalty.
[47]
 Otherwise, death penalty cannot be imposed upon the offender.
[48]
AAA's minority at the time the crimes were committed against her, was properly alleged and proven during trial. Evidence also proved that Tuyor had carnal knowledge of AAA without the latter's consent, with the use of force, threat and intimidation, and by taking advantage of his moral ascendancy. However, in the five Informations, the allegation that AAA is the "stepdaughter" of Tuyor, is inaccurate. Neither AAA is the stepdaughter of Tuyor nor is the latter the stepfather of the former, because such a relationship presupposes a legitimate relationship between the appellant and the victim's mother.
[49]
 A stepdaughter is the daughter of one's wife or husband by a former marriage, or a stepfather is the husband of one's mother by virtue of a marriage subsequent to that of which the person spoken of is the offspring
[50]
During trial, the prosecution failed to establish the stepparent-stepdaughter relationship between Tuyor and AAA. No proof of marriage was presented to establish Tuyor's relationship with AAA's mother. On the contrary, AAA's testimony shows that Tuyor was the live-in partner of AAA's mother, to wit:
Pros. Dumaual 
: How were you related to the accused?
Witness
  : He is my stepfather, sir.
 
 
Pros. Dumaual
: How did he become your stepfather?
Witness
: He is the live-in partner of my mother, sir.
[51]
 
 
x x x x
 
 
 
COURT 
: Is the accused married to your mother?
Witness
 : No, Your Honor.
[52]
Although the State has successfully proven the common-law relationship, the crime is only simple rape where the information does not properly allege the qualifying circumstance of relationship between the accused and the victim.
[53]
 This is because the accused's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him is inviolable
[54]
 Tuyor can only be convicted of simple rape, and not of qualified rape.
The Penalties
In Criminal Cases No. B-2008-767, B-2008-768, B-2008-770, B-2008-771, Rape through Sexual Intercourse, under paragraph 1 of Article 266-A, were committed without any of the qualifying or aggravating circumstances enumerated under Article 266-B, where the penalty for each count of rape shall be 
reclusion perpetua.
The Damages
For the four (4) counts of rape, the award of civil indemnities, moral and exemplary damages are proper.
Jurisprudence has settled that an award of civil indemnity 
ex delicto
 is mandatory upon a finding of the fact of rape, while moral damages may be automatically awarded in rape cases without need of proof of mental and physical suffering.
[55]
 The award of exemplary damages is also proper to set a public example, to serve as deterrent to elders who abuse and corrupt the youth, and to protect the latter from sexual abuse.
[56]
For the crime of simple rape under Article 266-A(1), the penalty to be imposed is 
reclusion perpetua
[57]
 with civil indemnity of P75,000.00, moral damages of P75,000.00, and exemplary damages of P75,000.00; in accordance with 
People v. Jugueta
.
[58]
In consonance with prevailing jurisprudence, the amount of damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) 
per annum
 from the finality of this judgment until said amounts are fully paid.
