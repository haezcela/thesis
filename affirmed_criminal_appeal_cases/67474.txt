 Mendoza (Carla), and Dennis Perillo (Perillo) of GMA 7 News and Current
 Affairs testified for the defense.
[8]




Version of the Prosecution



On June 13, 2010, P/SSupt. Eduardo P. Acierto (P/SSupt. Acierto) 
received a report from a confidential informant regarding the drug 
activities of a certain "Alex", a member of the Philippine National 
Police (PNP) assigned at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. 
According to the confidential informant, "Alex" operated in Makati City 
and had in his possession a huge amount of cocaine. Acting on the 
information, P/SSupt. Acierto instructed Police Superintendent Ismael G.
 Fajardo, Jr. (P/Supt. Fajardo) to conduct a buy-bust operation against 
"Alex". Thus, P/Supt. Fajardo designated Police Inspector Jay James 
Nepomuceno as the team leader, SPO2 Taldo as the poseur-buyer, and SPO3 
Ngo and PO3 Perida as the arresting officers. Meanwhile, the 
confidential informant arranged a test buy with "Alex" for the following
 day.
[9]





On June 14, 2010, around 8:20 in the evening, the buy bust team, 
together with the confidential informant arrived at A Venue along Makati
 Avenue, Makati City. There, the confidential informant introduced SPO2 
Taldo to "Alex", later identified as appellant Estabillo. Appellant 
informed SPO2 Taldo that the price of cocaine was P1,500,000.00 per 
kilo. SPO2 Taldo ordered four (4) kilos of cocaine and asked for a 
sample. Appellant gave SPO2 Taldo a gram of suspected cocaine, for which
 the latter paid P1,500.00. Before they separated, they agreed that 
appellant would contact the confidential informant once the four (4) 
kilos of cocaine becomes available.
[10]





SPO2 Taldo brought the sample to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination which yielded positive for cocaine.
[11]



On June 15, 2010, around 10:30 in the morning, SPO2 Taldo received news 
from the confidential informant that the four (4) kilos of cocaine he 
ordered from appellant was already available. Too, SPO2 Taldo was to pay
 appellant P6,000,000.00 at Mercury Drugstore, Las Fiestas Drive, 
Frontera Verde, Barangay Ugong, Pasig City at 11 o'clock that evening. 
Thus, the buy bust team prepared for the operation.
[12]



Around 6 o'clock in the evening, P/Supt. Fajardo presided over a final 
briefing at the PNP-AIDSOTF. He gave SPO2 Taldo six (6) P500.00 bills 
dusted with ultraviolet powder. The bills were placed on top of 60 
bundles of boodle money inside a striped red paper bag. The buy bust 
team agreed that SPO2 Taldo would dial SPO3 Ngo's mobile number once the
 transaction had been consummated. They also coordinated with the 
Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) after the final briefing.
[13]








Around 9 o'clock in the evening, the team proceeded to the area of 
operation. About two (2) hours later, appellant arrived on board a white
 and silver Mitsubishi Strada with plate number XDH 474. Appellant 
stopped in front of SPO2 Taldo and told the latter to board the front 
passenger seat of his car.
[14]




Inside the vehicle, appellant handed to SPO2 Taldo a maroon-brown 
shoebox labeled Otto containing two (2) bricks of suspected cocaine. In 
exchange, SPO2 Taldo handed appellant the boodle money. Before appellant
 could start counting its contents, SPO2 Taldo dialed SPO3 Ngo's number.
[15]




The other members of the team rushed to the vehicle and arrested 
appellant. PO3 Perida recovered the boodle money from appellant while 
SPO2 Taldo proceeded to mark the two (2) bricks of suspected cocaine in 
the Otto shoebox with LPP 06152315 2010 and LPP1 06152315 2010 together 
with his signature.
[16]
 Upon 
further search of the vehicle, PO3 Perida recovered a yellow Mario 
D'Boro box containing two (2) more bricks of suspected cocaine from 
behind the driver seat which he marked LPP2 06152315 2010 and LPP3 
06152315 2010 with his signature.
[17]
 The seized items were then placed in front of the vehicle for the witnesses to see.
[18]




The marking was done in the presence of Barangay Kagawad Felix Santos 
(Kagawad Santos) and two (2) representatives from the media, Erika 
Tapalla (Tapalla) from ABC 5 and Perillo from GMA 7. An inventory of the
 seized items was then prepared in the presence of appellant and the 
witnesses. Photographs were taken during the marking and inventory. No 
prosecutor from the Department of Justice (DOJ) was available to witness
 the inventory that night.
[19]




On June 16, 2010, around 10'clock in the morning, after the marking and 
inventory, SPO2 Taldo and PO3 Perida turned over the seized items to the
 investigator SPO3 Caluag. Upon concluding his investigation in half an 
hour, SPO3 Caluag turned over the two (2) boxes containing two (2) 
bricks each of suspected cocaine to PCI Paul Ed C. Ortiz (PCI Ortiz)
[20]

 of the PNP Crime Laboratory. All these happened at the place of arrest.
 Subsequently, at 2:55 in the morning, PCI Ortiz turned over the 
suspected cocaine to PSI Ballesteros of the PNP Crime Laboratory for 
testing. Per Chemistry Report No. D-43-10, all four (4) bricks tested 
positive for cocaine.
[21]


Version of the Defense



Appellant denied the charges.
[22]



On June 15, 2010, around 8 o'clock in the evening, he was with his 
daughter Carla at SM Marikina. While they were about to leave the 
parking area, he noticed three (3) manned vehicles parked near his car 
but didn't think much of it. When they got out of the parking area, 
however, the three (3) vehicles he saw earlier started following them. 
Worried, he dropped off his daughter at the corner of Ligaya and Marcos 
Highway and proceeded to Ortigas.
[23]


The three (3) vehicles continued following him, thus, he decided not to 
pass through the flyover and go to the well-lighted area of Tiendesitas 
instead. Suddenly, one of the vehicles cut his path and blocked his way.
 The passengers of the three (3) vehicles alighted, poked their guns at 
him, and dragged him on board a grey Mitsubishi Lancer. From inside, he 
saw that some of those who were following him had opened his vehicle and
 were searching it. He also noticed that other personalities arrived at 
the scene, including some members of the media. After some time, he was 
dragged out of the Mitsubishi Lancer and brought in front of his vehicle
 where he saw various items placed on top of the hood. He denied 
ownership of said items.
[24]


Ruling of the Trial Court



By Decision
[25]
 dated December 7, 2015, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 151, Pasig City rendered a verdict of conviction, thus:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:




1. Re: Criminal Case No. 17173-D. this Court finds the accused, 
ALEXANDER ESTABILLO 
y
 PALARA, GUILTY

 beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 5, Article
 II of Republic Act No. 9165, and accordingly, hereby sentences him to 
suffer the penalty of 
LIFE IMPRISONMENT
 and pay a 
fine in the amount of Ten Million pesos (P10,000,000.00)
.




2. Re: Criminal Case No. 17172-D, this Court finds the accused, 
ALEXANDER ESTABILLO 
y
 PALARA, GUILTY

 beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of violation of Section 11, 
Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, and accordingly, hereby sentences 
him to suffer the penalty of 
LIFE IMPRISONMENT
 and pay a 
fine in the amount of Ten Million pesos (P10,000,000.00)
.









The Officer-In-Charge/Branch Clerk of Court is ordered to transfer the 
possession and custody of the dangerous drugs subject of these cases to 
the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency for its disposal in accordance 
with law.


SO ORDERED.



It held that the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs were all 
present, considering that appellant was arrested following a buy bust 
operation. Too, the arresting officers recovered two (2) bricks of 
cocaine at the back of appellant's driver seat following his lawful 
arrest. Thus, appellant was also convicted of illegal possession of 
dangerous drugs. The trial court further held that the prosecution 
sufficiently established all four links in the chain of custody.
[26]





The trial court denied reconsideration on February 4, 2016.
[27]


Proceedings Before the Court of Appeals



On appeal,
[28]
 appellant faulted the trial court for rendering a verdict of conviction. He argued:




First.
 He was illegally arrested. The arresting officers did not 
have probable cause to arrest him since at that time, they were still 
unaware of whether the bricks inside the Otto shoebox truly contained 
cocaine. None of the arresting officers had personal knowledge of the 
actual contents of the shoebox.
[29]




Second.
 The arresting officers did not have reason to arrest 
appellant other than SPO2 Taldo's call to SPO3 Ngo. Said call was 
insufficient to establish probable cause for his warrantless arrest.
[30]


Third.
 The prosecution failed to show that he dusted positive for
 ultraviolet powder after he allegedly took possession of the buy bust 
money.
[31]


Fourth.
 GMA 7 reporter Perillo denied seeing any actual cocaine during his coverage of the incident.
[32]




Fifth.
 There was no DOJ representative present during the inventory and photograph.
[33]


Sixth.
 There is doubt on whether items examined by PSI 
Ballesteros were the same items seized from appellant. For records show 
that there were two (2) requests for laboratory examination made 
concerning the same items allegedly seized from him. On the one hand, 
PSI Ballesteros testified that PCI Ortiz delivered the seized items to 
him. On the other hand, one of the requests for laboratory examination 
stated that the seized items were delivered by SPO3 Caluag.
[34]


Seventh.
 The prosecution failed to adduce documentary proof of 
compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165. At any rate, PCI Ortiz did not 
testify during the trial, breaking the link between the investigator and
 the forensic chemist.
[35]


Finally.
 the trial court did not perform an ocular inspection of 
the seized items within 72 hours as required under Section 21 of RA 
9165.
[36]





The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), on the other hand, defended the verdict of conviction.
[37]
 It maintained that all the elements of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs were present.
[38]
 It also refuted appellant's arguments, thus:


First.
 The arresting officers had every right to believe the four
 (4) bricks recovered from appellant contained cocaine, considering that
 they earlier performed a test buy which yielded positive results. More,
 there was already a meeting between the minds of appellant and SPO2 
Taldo concerning the sale of four 4 kilos of cocaine; the arresting 
officers did not have reason to doubt that appellant would not uphold 
his end of the bargain. At any rate, an on the spot laboratory 
examination of the drug items is ludicrous and unrealistic.
[39]


Second.
 The call to SPO3 Ngo was the buy bust team's 
pre-determined signal for the consummation of the sale. Thus, when SPO2 
Taldo dialed SPO3 Ngo's number, the buy bust team had probable cause to 
believe that the sale of cocaine had in fact been consummated, and that 
appellant committed a crime.
[40]




Third.
 The prosecution's failure to submit the results of the 
ultraviolet test did not weaken the case of the prosecution. For the use
 of ultraviolet powder is not even required in buy bust operations.
[41]


Fourth.
 Whether Perillo actually saw any off-white powdered 
substance is immaterial. He only had to witness and identify the items 
seized from appellant. It is up to the forensic chemist to determine 
whether these items are positive for drugs after performing qualitative 
examinations thereon.
[42]


Fifth.
 The arresting officers sufficiently explained the absence 
of a representative from the DOJ during the buy bust operation. Despite 
earnest efforts from the arresting officers to secure the presence of 
such witness, they failed because there was no duty prosecutor that 
night.
[43]


Sixth.
 PSI Ballesteros explained the supposed double request for 
laboratory examination. He testified that it was PCI Ortiz who delivered
 the seized items to him while the results were to be released to SPO3 
Caluag as the actual requesting party.
[44]


Seventh.
 The prosecution established that the arresting officers 
complied with the chain of custody rule, hence, the integrity and 
evidentiary value of thee seized items were duly preserved. Documentary 
evidence is not necessary to prove transfers of custody; testimonial 
evidence would suffice.
[45]


Finally.
 The trial court's failure to perform an ocular 
inspection did not weaken the case of the prosecution. For the sole 
purpose of an ocular inspection is to allow the presentation of 
representati ve samples during the trial rather than the entirety of the
 items seized, allowing he immediate destruction of the contraband. 
Thus, ocular inspection is unnecessary in the present case where the 
entire bricks of cocaine were presented during the trial, not just their
 representative samples.
[46]



Subsequently, appellant filed his supplemental brief,
[47]

 arguing that the buy bust operation could not be considered valid since
 the prosecution did not offer the testimony of any of the insulating 
witnesses during the trial. He insisted on his innocence, citing the 
arresting officers non-compliance with Section 21, RA 9165 and 
People v. Lim
[48]
 as bases.


The Ruling of the Court of Appeals



Under Decision
[49]
 dated April
 26, 2019, the Court of Appeals affirmed. For one, appellant was validly
 arrested sans judicial warrant as he was caught in 
flagrante delicto

 selling two (2) bricks of cocaine. The consequent search of his vehicle
 which yielded two (2) more bricks of cocaine was therefore legal.
[50]

 For another, the prosecution established the elements of illegal sale 
and possession of dangerous drugs were duly established through an 
unbroken chain of custody over the seized items.
[51]



The Court of Appeals denied reconsideration on October 9, 2019.
[52]


Present Appeal



Appellant now seeks the reversal of the verdict of conviction anew. By 
Resolution dated February 3, 2021, the Court directed the parties to 
file their supplemental briefs if they so desire. On even date, 
appellant filed his supplemental brief
[53]

 which essentially reiterates his arguments before the Court of Appeals.
 Meanwhile, the OSG manifested that it will no longer be submitting its 
supplemental brief.


Ruling



We affirm.






Appellant is barred from questioning the validity of his arrest


 






Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure enumerates the instances when a warrantless arrest is lawful, 
viz
.:


Section 5. 
Arrest without warrant; when lawful
. - A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:


(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, 
is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;
 (emphasis added)


x x x x



Here, appellant was arrested in 
flagrante delicto
 on June 15, 
2010, following a buy-bust operation. As borne in the records, 
poseur-buyer SPO2 Leonardo Taldo paid appellant six (6) P500.00 bills 
placed inside a bag of boodle money, all dusted with ultraviolet powder,
 in exchange for two (2) bricks of suspected cocaine placed inside a 
maroon-brown Otto shoebox. Once the transaction got consummated, SPO2 
Taldo performed the buy-bust team's pre-arranged signal by calling the 
phone of SPO3 Ngo. Subsequently, the rest of the buy-bust team rushed to
 arrest appellant and performed a search on his vehicle, resulting in 
the seizure of yet another shoebox containing two (2) more bricks of 
suspected cocaine.
[54]



Appellant nevertheless assails the validity of his warrantless arrest, arguing on appeal that he could not have been caught in 
flagrante delicto

 selling dangerous drugs since the arresting officers had no personal 
knowledge on whether the four (4) bricks allegedly seized from him were 
actually cocaine. Too, SPO2 Taldo's call to SPO3 Ngo was not sufficient 
basis for probable cause that he had just committed a crime.
[55]



We are not persuaded.



Objections against the lawfulness of an arrest which are not raised 
through a motion to quash before the accused enters his or her plea are 
deemed waived, for the voluntary submission of an accused to the 
jurisdiction of the court and his or her active participation during the
 trial cures any defect or irregularity that may have attended an 
arrest.
[56]



Here, appellant questioned the validity of his arrest only on appeal 
before the Court of Appeals. By that time, he was already estopped from 
raising any objection against the legality of his warrantless arrest. To
 be sure, appellant willingly stipulated during the pre-trial that the 
trial court had jurisdiction over his person.
[57]
 He is therefore barred from claiming otherwise.






All the elements illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs were present


 







Appellant is charged with unauthorized sale and possession of dangerous 
drugs allegedly committed on June 15, 2010. The applicable law therefore
 is RA 9165 before its amendment in 2014. These offenses are defined and
 penalized under Sections 5 and 11 of the same law, thus:


SEC. 5. 
Sale, Trading, Administration, Dispensation, 
Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Dangerous Drugs and/or 
Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals
. - The penalty of life
 imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand 
pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be 
imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, 
trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, 
dispatch in transit or transport any dangerous drug, including any and 
all species of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity 
involved, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.


x x x x



SEC. 11. 
Possession of Dangerous Drugs
. - The penalty of life 
imprisonment to death and a tine ranging from Five hundred thousand 
pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be 
imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall possess 
any dangerous drug in the following quantities, regardless of the degree
 or purity thereof:


x x x x


(4) 10 grams or more of cocaine or cocaine hydrochloride;



All the elements of both offenses are present here.






a.


 
The elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs are present


 







To secure a conviction for illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the 
prosecution must establish the following elements: (1) the identity of 
the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and its consideration; 
and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.
[58]



As the Court of Appeals aptly noted, SPO2 Taldo, the poseur-buyer, gave a
 clear and accurate account of the transaction that occurred between him
 and appellant on June 15, 2010, 
viz
.:
[59]








Prosecutor Porte:






Q:


When you were on board the Mitsubishi Strada, what happened next?






A:


 
He asked me where the money is.














Q:


What was your reaction then?






A:


 I told him I want to see first the cocaine.














Q:


What was the reaction of alias Alex?






A:


He picked-up a brown shoe box with marking Otto, and he handed it to me.














Q:


What did you do with the box?






A:


I opened the box.














Q:


After you opened the box, did you see anything inside the box?






A:


I saw the 2 bricks of suspected cocaine.














Q:


After you saw the bricks of suspected cocaine, what was your reaction?






A:


 
I gave him the boodle money.














Q:


Was alias Alex able to receive the boodle money?






A:


 Yes, sir.







Based on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, appellant was the
 seller and SPO2 Taldo was the buyer in the illegal sale of dangerous 
drugs subject of this case. SPO2 Taldo was supposed to purchase four (4)
 kilos of cocaine but only two (2) bricks were delivered to him before 
the buy bust team arrested appellant. In exchange for these two (2) 
bricks of cocaine, SPO2 Taldo handed appellant a bag containing six (6) 
500 bills and 60 bundles of boodle money dusted with ultraviolet powder 
as payment. The sale of illegal drugs was therefore consummated.



Appellant argues though that if there was indeed a sale and he truly 
received payment from SPO2 Taldo, then he should have tested positive 
for ultraviolet powder. The prosecution, however, did not offer in 
evidence any proof of such positive result.
[60]



The argument utterly lacks merit.



The arresting officer's failure to test appellant for ultraviolet powder
 is not fatal to the prosecution's case. For the law does not require 
buy-bust money and boodle money used in anti-drug operations to be 
dusted with ultraviolet powder for purposes of proving delivery of 
payment. This second element may be established through other means, 
such as the testimony of the poseur-buyer himself, as here. To 
reiterate, SPO2 Taldo categorically testified that he had delivered 
payment to appellant. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals 
found this testimony to be credible. The Court sees no cogent reason to 
depart from this uniform factual findings of the courts below.






b. 


 
The elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs are present


 







In a prosecution for illegal possession of dangerous drugs, it must be 
shown that (1) the accused was in possession of an item or an object 
identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug; (2) such possession is 
not authorized by law; and (3) the accused was freely and consciously 
aware of being in possession of the drug.
[61]



"Possession" under the contemplation of Section 11, RA 9165 may either be actual or constructive. 
People v. Santos
,
[62]
 citing 
People v. Lagman
,
[63]
 elucidates:


x x x Possession, under the law, includes not only actual 
possession, but also constructive possession. Actual possession exists 
when the drug is in the immediate possession or control of the accused. 
On the other hand, constructive possession exists when the drug is under
 the dominion and control of the accused or when he has the right to 
exercise dominion and control over the place where it is found. 
Exclusive possession or control is not necessary. The accused cannot 
avoid conviction if his right to exercise control and dominion over the 
place where the contraband is located, is shared with another.




Here, appellant had possession of the two (2) bricks of cocaine 
recovered from behind the driver seat of his vehicle upon his arrest. 
Though he did not have immediate physical possession of these items, he 
had constructive possession thereof. Only he had dominion of these 
items. The two (2) bricks of cocaine were under his control and 
disposal.



Appellant cannot deny knowledge of the two (2) additional bricks of 
cocaine inside his car. Obviously, he was about to sell them to SPO2 
Taldo to complete the latter's order of four (4) kilos of cocaine. But 
before he could physically deliver the rest of his merchandise to SPO2 
Taldo, the buy bust team moved in and effected his arrest.



All told, all the elements of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs are present.






The prosecution sufficiently established all the links in the chain of custody


 







Finally, appellant asserts that the prosecution failed to establish an 
unbroken chain of custody of the seized items. Otherwise stated, even 
assuming the elements of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs 
were duly established, the prosecution nevertheless failed to prove that
 the items supposedly seized from him were the same ones offered in 
evidence during the trial.








We resolve.



In illegal drugs cases, the drug itself constitutes the 
corpus delicti

 of the offense. The prosecution, therefore, is tasked to establish that
 the substance illegally possessed by the accused is the same substance 
presented in court.
[64]



To ensure the integrity of the seized drug item, the prosecution must account for each link in its chain of custody:
[65]
 
first
, the seizure and marking of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; 
second
, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; 
third
, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and 
fourth
, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.
[66]



Section 21 of RA 9165 further prescribes the standard in preserving the 
corpus delicti
 in illegal drug cases, 
viz
:


SECTION 21. 
Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, 
Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous 
Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, 
Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment
. - The PDEA 
shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources
 of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as 
well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so 
confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the 
following manner:




(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the 
drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically 
inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the 
person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her
 representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the 
Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall 
be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy 
thereof;




(2) Within twenty-four (24) hours upon confiscation/seizure of dangerous
 drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and 
essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or 
laboratory equipment, the same shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic 
Laboratory for a qualitative and quantitative examination;







 


(3) A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results, 
which shall be done under oath by the forensic laboratory examiner, 
shall be issued within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt of the 
subject item/s: 
Provided
, That when the volume of the dangerous 
drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, and controlled precursors and 
essential chemicals does not allow the completion of testing within the 
time frame, a partial laboratory examination report shall be 
provisionally issued stating therein the quantities of dangerous drugs 
still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: 
Provided, however
,
 That a final certification shall be issued on the completed forensic 
laboratory examination on the same within the next twenty-four (24) 
hours;




(4) After the filing of the criminal case, the Court shall, within 
seventy-two (72) hours, conduct an ocular inspection of the confiscated,
 seized and/or surrendered dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous 
drugs, and controlled precursors and essential chemicals, including the 
instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment, and through the 
PDEA shall within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter proceed with the 
destruction or burning of the same, in the presence of the accused or 
the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or 
his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and 
the DOJ, civil society groups and any elected public official. The Board
 shall draw up the guidelines on the manner of proper disposition and 
destruction of such item/s which shall be borne by the offender: 
Provided
, That those item/s of lawful commerce, as determined by the Board, shall be donated, used or recycled for legitimate purposes: 
Provided, further
, That a representative sample, duly weighed and recorded is retained;




x x x x



More, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 ordains:


Section 21. (a) The apprehending officer/team having initial
 custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and 
confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the 
presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were 
confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a 
representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and 
any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of 
the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical 
inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the 
search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the 
nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is 
practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that 
non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as 
long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are 
properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render 
void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items. (emphases
 added)




The Court finds that the prosecution sufficiently established compliance with the afore-cited rules.


a. First Link



The first link of the chain of custody is the seizure and marking of the
 illegal drug recovered from the accused, as well as compliance with the
 physical inventory and photograph requirements.
[67]



Marking is the starting point in the custodial link. It serves to separate the marked evidence from the 
corpus

 of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized 
from the accused until they are disposed, thus, preventing switching, 
planting or contamination of evidence. Marking though should be done in 
the presence of the apprehended violator immediately upon confiscation 
to truly ensure that they are the same items which enter the chain of 
custody.
[68]



After marking the seized items, the apprehending team shall conduct a 
physical inventory and photograph the seized items in the presence of 
the accused or his representative or counsel, a representative from the 
media and the DOJ, and any elected public official.
[69]
 The purpose of the law in having these witnesses is to prevent or insulate against and deter possible planting of evidence.
[70]
 Failure to comply with this three (3) witness rule, however, does not 
ipso facto

 invalidate or render void the seizure and custody over the items as 
long as the prosecution is able to show that (a) there is justifiable 
ground for noncompliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of
 the seized items are properly preserved.
[71]


Here, SPO2 Taldo immediately marked the two (2) bricks of cocaine in the
 Otto shoebox he received from appellant with LPP 06152315 2010 and LPP1
 06152315 2010 together with his signature at the place of operation.
[72]

 Meanwhile, PO3 Perida recovered a yellow Mario D'Boro box containing 
two (2) more bricks of suspected cocaine from behind the driver seat 
which he, too, immediately marked LPP2 06152315 2010 and LPP3 06152315 
2010 with his signature.
[73]
 
The marking was done in the presence of Barangay Kagawad Santos and two 
(2) representatives from the media, Tapalla from ABC 5 and Perillo from 
GMA 7.
[74]
 An inventory of the
 seized items was then prepared in the presence of appellant and the 
witnesses. Photographs were taken during the marking and inventory.
[75]





Dissatisfied, appellant bewails the absence of a representative from the
 DOJ during the operation. He claims that the absence of a DOJ 
representative during inventory is ground for acquittal. He, too, relies
 on the testimony of Perillo wherein the latter denied seeing white 
powdered substance, albeit he saw the bricks wrapped in masking tape 
which were allegedly seized from appellant, rendering the inventory 
questionable.
[76]



We are not persuaded.


For one
, the arresting officers offered adequate explanation for 
the absence of a DOJ representative during the inventory. As the Court 
of Appeals keenly observed, the arresting officers exerted earnest 
effort to secure a witness from the DOJ but to no avail:


x x x While there was no DOJ representative to witness the 
marking and inventory, SPO1 Taldo, PO3 Perida and SPO3 Ngo explained 
that, although they exerted efforts to secure the presence of a 
representative from the DOJ, there was no duty prosecutor at the time 
when they conducted the buy-bust operation. The Court notes that it was 
close to midnight when the operation took place.




Verily, there was simply no prosecutor from the DOJ who was available to
 witness the inventory at that very late hour in the evening. We also 
consider the immediacy of performing the marking and inventory of seized
 items which ought riot be delayed. In 
People v. Maralit
,
[77]

 the Court took these twin circumstances into consideration in affirming
 the verdict of conviction against therein appellant despite the absence
 of a DOJ representative during the marking and inventory, 
viz
.:


Here, it is evident from the records that the marking and inventory of the two (2) bricks of 
marijuana
 were immediately conducted at the place of the arrest
,
 soon after these items were taken from Maralit. Between Maralit's 
arrest and the marking of the items, only ten (10) minutes passed, which
 the prosecution adequately justified as the time spent by the 
apprehending team waiting for the arrival of the witnesses to the 
marking and inventory.


Furthermore, during the marking and inventory of the seized items, there
 were two (2) barangay officials and one (1) media representative 
present. While there was no DOJ representative to witness the marking 
and inventory, 
IO1 Esmin and PO2 Caalim explained that they were no 
longer able to contact a representative from the DOJ because by the time
 they were finished with the entrapment operation, it was beyond office 
hours.


The Court does not lose sight of the fact that under various field 
conditions, compliance with the requirements under Section 21 of R.A. 
No. 9165 may not always be possible.
 Thus, while the presence of all
 these witnesses are ordinarily required, non-compliance is excusable 
when the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items were 
properly preserved. There should also be proper justification for the 
arresting officers' failure to comply with the procedure under Section 
21 of R.A. No. 9165.





Considering that the police officers explained the absence of the 
DOJ

 representative, coupled with the fact that they endeavored to comply 
with the mandatory procedure by securing the presence of elected 
officials and a representative from the media, their failure to strictly
 observe Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 is not fatal to the case. 
The 
integrity and evidentiary value of the seized evidence were nonetheless 
preserved because there were other witnesses to the marking and 
inventory of the seized bricks of 
marijuana
. Two (2) barangay 
officials and a representative from the media were present during this 
stage, photographs were taken, and an inventory signed by these 
witnesses was prepared.
 Furthermore, while the inventory does not 
bear the signature of Maralit, the photographs show that Maralit was 
present during the marking and inventory of the seized items. (emphases 
added)





Clearly, the justifications offered in 
Maralit
 closely 
correspond to the explanations given by the arresting officers here. 
Thus, we are compelled to observe the same degree of reasonableness 
here.



At any rate, the Court keenly notes that as in 
Maralit
, 
the arresting officers here were likewise able to preserve the integrity
 and evidentiary value of the seized items which were marked, 
inventoried, and photographed in front of an elected official and two 
(2) media representatives. To be clear though, a media representative is
 no substitute for a DOJ representative under RA 9165 prior to its 
amendment. However, the arresting officers' decision to invite 
additional witnesses than required is cogent proof of their good faith, 
if not, earnest efforts to comply with the witness requirement under 
Section 21, RA 9165, and more important, to ensure transparency and 
dispel any kind of suspicion on the legitimacy of the operation.


For another
, it was not Perillo's job as insulating witness to 
look for white powdery substance which could possibly be dangerous 
drugs. For the insulating witnesses do 
not
 guarantee that the 
items seized from an accused are indeed dangerous drugs. They only 
needed to confirm that the items seized from appellant as appearing in 
the inventory, regardless of whether they are dangerous drugs or simply 
mundane things, are the same items offered in evidence before the trial 
court.





As the Court of Appeals correctly held, therefore, the first link in the chain was duly established.


b. Second Link



The second link pertains to the turnover of the illegal drug seized by 
the apprehending officer to the investigating officer. This is a 
necessary step in the chain of custody because it will be the 
investigating officer who shall conduct the proper investigation and 
prepare the necessary documents for the developing criminal case.
[78]



Here, SPO2 Taldo and PO3 Perida turned over the seized items to SPO3 
Caluag, the designated investigator for the case. This was established 
through the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as well as the 
Turn-Over of Confiscated/Seized Evidence
.
[79]



At any rate, appellant did not raise any specific argument against the second link which is, therefore, deemed proved.


c. Third Link



The third link is the turnover of the seized drugs by the investigating officer to the forensic chemist for examination.



Records show that on June 16, 2010, at 1:30 in the morning, SPO3 Caluag 
turned over the seized items to PCI Ortiz of the PNP Crime Laboratory 
who was present at the operation. Thereafter, PSI Ballesteros received 
the seized items from PCI Ortiz for laboratory examination at 2:55 that 
same morning. Per Chemistry Report No. D-43-10, all four (4) bricks 
tested positive for cocaine.



Appellant claims, however, that the third link was not sufficiently 
established considering that the prosecution did not present PCI Ortiz 
as witness. Too, PSI Ballesteros received two (2) requests for 
laboratory examination, one each from SPO3 Caluag and PCI Ortiz.



The arguments fail to convince.



The prosecution's failure to present the testimony of PCI Ortiz did not 
diminish the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items. To be 
sure, the Court is not inflexible in its treatment of drug cases. As 
held in 
Malillin v. People
:
[80]


While testimony about a perfect chain is not always the 
standard because it is almost always impossible to obtain, an unbroken 
chain of custody becomes indispensable and essential when the item of 
real evidence is not distinctive and is not readily identifiable, or 
when its condition at the time of testing or trial is critical, or when a
 witness has failed to observe its uniqueness. The same standard 
likewise obtains in case the evidence is susceptible to alteration, 
tampering, contamination and even substitution and exchange. 
In other
 words, the exhibit's level of susceptibility to fungibility, alteration
 or tampering without regard to whether the same is advertent or 
otherwise not dictates the level of strictness in the application of the
 chain of custody rule.


Indeed, the likelihood of tampering, loss or mistake with respect to 
an exhibit is greatest when the exhibit is small and is one that has 
physical characteristics fungible in nature and similar in form to 
substances familiar to people in their daily lives.
 
Graham vs. State

 positively acknowledged this danger. In that case where a substance 
later analyzed as heroin was handled by two police officers prior to 
examination who however did not testify in court on the condition and 
whereabouts of the exhibit at the time it was in their possession was 
excluded from the prosecution evidence, the court pointing out that the 
white powder seized could have been indeed heroin or it could have been 
sugar or baking powder. It ruled that unless the state can show by 
records or testimony, the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit at least
 between the time it came into the possession of police officers until 
it was tested in the laboratory to determine its composition, testimony 
of the state as to the laboratory's findings is inadmissible. (emphases 
added)




Indeed, strict adherence to Section 21 is required where the quantity of
 illegal drugs seized is miniscule, since it is highly susceptible to 
planting, tampering or alteration of evidence.
[81]
 But this is not the case here where appellant was caught with four (4) bricks of cocaine weighing about one (1) kilo each.



What makes the seized items here even more peculiar was that they were 
wrapped in masking tape and distinctly marked during the operation with 
LPP 06152315 2010, LPP1 06152315 2010, LPP2 06152315 2010 and LPP3 
06152315 2010 together with the signature of the arresting officers. 
Photos of these four (4) bricks were also taken, allowing confirmation 
on whether the same bricks of cocaine seized from appellant landed on 
the hands of PSI Ballesteros. This would not have been possible had the 
case involved miniscule amounts.



In any event, the presumption of regularity in the performance of 
official functions operates in favor of the arresting officers.
[82]

 Unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the police officers 
were inspired by any improper motive or did not properly perform their 
duty, their testimonies on the operation deserve full faith and credit. 
Thus, unless the presumption is rebutted, it becomes conclusive.
[83]





Here, the arresting officers were not impelled by any improper motive to
 perform the buy-bust and arrest appellant other than their genuine 
desire to properly perform their functions. In fact, they did not 
hastily act on the report from their confidential informant and 
conducted a test buy to verify the information they received. When it 
yielded positive results, they immediately hatched the buy-bust 
operation. There were no serious lapses during its conduct. At most, no 
DOJ representative was present during the inventory but even this was 
justified. The presumption of regularity, should therefore be upheld to 
fill the supposed gap in the chain of custody.




 


As for the double request for laboratory examination, this too was 
adequately explained. The request from PCI Ortiz was due to the fact 
that he was the one who personally delivered the seized items to PSI 
Ballesteros. But PCI Ortiz also worked at the PNP Crime Laboratory and 
was actually PSI Ballesteros' superior. Though present at the scene, PCI
 Ortiz was not part of the buy bust team, the actual party who would be 
interested in the results of the laboratory examination for purposes of 
filing a criminal case against appellant. Thus, SPO3 Caluag prepared his
 own request for laboratory examination so that their station would 
directly receive the results of said examination within 24 hours as 
required under Section 21 of RA 9165.



Verily, the third link. was also established.


d. Fourth Link



The final link is the turnover and submission of the seized items by the forensic chemist to the court.



Here, PSI Ballesteros brought the seized items to the trial court during
 the pre-trial conference and hearing-on appellant's petition for bail. 
Said items were marked as exhibits in open court in the presence of 
appellant himself and counsel.
[84]
 PSI Ballesteros further testified during the trial:
[85]








Prosecutor Manguiat-Ngaosi:














Q:


 
I have here two (2) shoeboxes one yellow and 
one maroon. Can you please go over these including the contents of these
 boxes and tell us what are the relation of these, if any, to the 
exhibits presented to you that you earlier mentioned?






A:


 These are the specimens submitted to me for examination, ma'am.














Q:


Why do you know that these are the specimens submitted for examination?






A:


I placed my own markings, ma'am.














Q:


What are your markings placed on these exhibits, Mr. Witness?






A:


For Box no. 1, I placed D-43-10E MAB, my 
initials, the date, June 16, 2010, and its contents D-43-10 A-2 and 
D-43-10 A-1, for the second box, I placed D-43-10 B, my initials, the 
date, June 16, 2010, and for its contents I placed D-43-10 B-2, D-43-10 
B-1.








In fine, there is no doubt that the items seized from appellant and 
tested by PSI Ballesteros were the same items delivered to court for 
purposes of prosecuting appellant's case.






Appellant, however, faults the trial court for failure to perform an 
ocular inspection within 72 hours from the filing of the Informations as
 required by Section 21(4) of RA 9165.



But the same does not, in any way, affect the integrity and evidentiary 
value of the seized items. To recall, Section 21(4) of RA 9165 states:


SECTION 21. 
Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, 
Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous 
Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, 
Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment
. - The PDEA 
shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources
 of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as 
well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so 
confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the 
following manner:



x x x x


(4) After the filing of the criminal case, the Court shall, within 
seventy-two (72) hours, conduct an ocular inspection of the confiscated,
 seized and/or surrendered dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous 
drugs, and controlled precursors and essential chemicals, including the 
instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment, and 
through the PDEA shall within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter proceed with the destruction or burning of the same
,
 in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items 
were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a 
representative from the media and the DOJ, civil society groups and any 
elected public official. The Board shall draw up the guidelines on the 
manner of proper disposition and destruction of such item/s which shall 
be borne by the offender: 
Provided
, That those item/s of lawful commerce, as determined by the Board, shall be donated, used or recycled for legitimate purposes: 
Provided, further
, That a representative sample, duly weighed and recorded is retained;
 (emphases added)





Clearly, the purpose of the provision is to allow the PDEA to destroy 
the seized drug items even before they are presented in court to reduce 
the risk of these items ending up back in the streets. Meanwhile, ocular
 inspection allows the trial court to personally see the seized items 
before they are destroyed by the PDEA. It ensures that the 
representative sample
 brought to court as proof of the 
corpus delicti
 actually came from the items seized from the accused.




Otherwise stated, Section 21(4) of RA 9165 bears upon the integrity and 
evidentiary value of representative samples only. Non-compliance with 
the provision would not affect the integrity and evidentiary value of 
the entirety of the seized items when said items themselves are 
presented in court, not just their representative samples, as here.







 
 


Here, the prosecution offered in evidence not just mere representative 
samples of the four (4) bricks of cocaine seized from appellant but the 
four (4) bricks of cocaine themselves duly marked as Exhibits HH, II, KK
 and LL.
[86]
 Surely, this is 
over-compliance with the chain of custody rule which allows mere 
representative samples to be offered in evidence during trial. Since the
 seized drug items were not destroyed, the integrity and evidentiary 
value of the seized items were further preserved.



The Court recognizes though that the PDEA's failure to destroy the (4) 
bricks of cocaine beforehand nevertheless constituted a breach of 
Section 21(4), RA 9165. To repeat, however, this would not affect the 
integrity and evidentiary value of the entirety of the seized items but 
could, at most, be ground for possible disciplinary action.



All told, the prosecution has successfully established the chain of 
custody of the seized items. Consequently, the integrity and evidentiary
 value of these seized items are deemed preserved. The 
corpus delicti

 of the crimes charged against appellant were therefore established. As 
such, there is no reason to depart from the assailed verdicts of 
conviction.


ACCORDINGLY
, the appeal is 
DISMISSED
. The Decision dated April 26, 2019 and Resolution dated October 9, 2019 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 08244 are
