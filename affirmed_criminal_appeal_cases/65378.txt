SO ORDERED.

 (Emphases in the original.)
On November 24, 2016, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration,
[11]
 contending, among others, that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were self-serving. He argued that the findings of fact made by the Sandiganbayan were not proven during the trial and that its ruling was based mainly on conjectures and surmises. Petitioner maintained that in signing documents, he performed only ministerial functions and that he relied on the tasks performed by his subordinates which were done in a regular manner.
In its Resolution
[12]
 dated January 15, 2018, the Sandiganbayan denied the motions for reconsideration filed by some of the accused, including that of the petitioner. The court stood by its earlier findings that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the petitioner and his other co-accused. The dispositive portion of the said Resolution reads as follows:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court resolves to deny the following:
1) Motion for Reconsideration dated November 22, 2016, filed by accused Maximo A. Borje, Jr., through counsel;
2) Motion for Reconsideration dated November 24, 2016, filed by accused Florendo B. Aries (sic), through counsel;
3) Motion for Reconsideration (Of The Decision Dated November 10, 2016) dated November 24, 2016, filed by accused Conchita M. dela Cruz, through counsel;
and
4) Motion for Reconsideration dated November 18, 2016, filed by accused Burt B. Favorito, through counsel.
[13]
Hence, the present petition.
Petitioner raised the following issues for our consideration:
I
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN, FOURTH DIVISION, HAS COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT FOUND PETITIONER-APPELLANT FLORENDO B. ARIAS GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF ESTAFA AND VIOLATION OF SECTION 3(E) OF R.A. 3019, CONTRARY TO THE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE.
II
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN, FOURTH DIVISION, COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT GAVE DUE COURSE TO THE PROSECUTION'S EXHIBITS DESPITE FAILURE TO PRESENT THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN FALSIFIED.
[14]
The petition lacks merit.
All the elements of the crime of Estafa through Falsification of Official/Commercial Documents were established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.
Article 315, paragraph 2 (a) of the Revised Penal Code (
RPC
) reads, as follows:
Article 315. Swindling (Estafa). - Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow x x x:
x x x x
2. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud:
x x x x
(a) By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions, or by means of other similar deceits.
The elements of the above crime are the following:
1. That there must be a false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means;
2. That such false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means must be made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud;
3. That the offended party must have relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act, or fraudulent means, that is, he was induced to part with his money or property because of the false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means; and
4. That as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage.
Article 171, paragraph 4 of the RPC provides that:
Article 171. x x x. - The penalty of 
prision mayor
 and a fine not to exceed 5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts:
x x x x
4. Making untruthful statements in a narration of facts[.]
In this case, certain funding requirements were set forth by the Department of Public Works and Highways (
DPWH
) for the payment of claims for emergency repairs of DPWH service vehicles, thus:
D. FUNDING REQUIREMENTS
1. Documentation - No claim for payment for the emergency minor/major repair of service vehicles of this Department shall be processed by the Accounting Division, CFMS without strictly following provisions of COA Circular No. 92-389 dated November 03, 1992. The following documentary requirements shall be complied with prior to funding and/or processing of payment, to wit:
1.1 Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA) for said claim which shall be signed by the concerned Undersecretary, Assistant Secretary, Bureau Directors, Project Director/Manager, Service Chief, or the duly designated representative of the office of the end-user;
1.2 Certification of Emergency Purchase/Repair which shall be signed by the end-user, duly approved by the Head of Office concerned (with the rank higher than Division Chief)[;]
1.3 Abstract of Open Canvass and corresponding written quotations for the purchase of spare parts and repair of vehicles duly signed by the Supply Officer, Canvasser, and supplier concerned[;]
1.4 The Requisition for Supplies or Equipment (RSE) which shall be prepared and signed by the end-user, recommended for approval and duly approved by the official concerned, in accordance with the existing delegation of authorities;
1.5 The Motor Vehicle Pre-repair/Post-repair Inspection Report which shall indicate the Control Series No. and the date of inspection, duly signed by all the members of the Special Inspectorate Team (SIT);
1.6 The Certificate of Acceptance which shall be signed by the end-user of said vehicle. All documents, under accounting and auditing rules and regulations, shall be signed by the official and/or supplier concerned over their respective printed names.
[15]
Based on the evidence presented by the prosecution, it was proven that except for the Cash Invoices issued by the suppliers, the documents required under the DPWH Memorandum,
[16]
 dated July 31, 1997, were prepared, accomplished and signed by all the public officials concerned, taking advantage of their official positions in making untruthful statements in the narration of facts. The said documents were made to appear that the 39 service vehicles underwent emergency repairs or required purchase of spare parts. In addition, in order to claim payment from DPWH, the Disbursement Vouchers were also falsified to justify the release of checks.
Thus, as aptly ruled by the Sandiganbayan, all the elements of the crime of Estafa through Falsification of Official/Commercial Documents are present because the petitioner and his co-accused utilized false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means to make it appear that the DPWH service vehicles underwent emergency repairs or required the purchase of spare parts, and that reimbursements are due to petitioner by using falsified documents. Through those falsified documents, petitioner and his co-accused employed fraudulent means in order to defraud the government in paying the claims for the fictitious emergency repairs/purchases of spare parts. Therefore, the government suffered undue injury or damages in the amount of P5,166,539.00 through such fraudulent act.
As held by the Sandiganbayan:
The Court finds, and so holds, that all the aforementioned documents submitted were falsified. Except for the Cash Invoices issued by the suppliers, the documents were prepared, accomplished and/or executed and signed by public officers/employees taking advantage of their official positions in making untruthful statements in the narration of facts. Through these documents, it was made to appear, albeit untrue, that the 39 vehicles subject of reimbursements claimed and paid to accused Martinez in the total sum of P5,166,539.00 underwent emergency repairs that required purchases of spare parts. The Disbursement Vouchers were also falsified to justify the release of checks for payment of the reimbursements claimed. The Cash Invoices issued by the suppliers were also falsified because they pertain to fictitious or non-existent purchases of spare parts. As earlier stated, these falsified documents were all utilized in sinister schemes to steal government funds.
The evidence on record shows that the falsified documents were accomplished and signed or initialed by the accused, as follows:
x x x x
The aforementioned falsified documents, as well as the Cash Invoices issued by suppliers DEB and JCAP, were all utilized to defraud the government in a manner constituting Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the RPC. All the elements thereof were present, to wit:
First. There were false pretenses, fraudulent acts or fraudulent means in that it was made to appear, through the use of the falsified documents, that the DPWH service vehicles in question underwent emergency repairs that required purchases of spare parts, and that reimbursements were due to accused Martinez;
Second. The false pretenses, fraudulent acts or fraudulent means, in the form of falsification of documents, were employed prior to the commission of the fraud; that is to deceive the government in paying the claims for the fictitious emergency repairs/purchases of spare parts;
 Third. The government was induced to pay the claims relying on the false pretenses, fraudulent acts or fraudulent means employed;
- and-
Fourth. The government suffered damages in the total amount of P5,166,539.00, the sum total of the false claims paid.
The crime committed was the complex crime of Estafa Through Falsification of Documents, as charged in the Information dated March 1, 2005.
When the offender commits on a public, official or commercial document any of the acts of falsification enumerated in Article 171 of the RPC as a necessary means to commit another crime like Estafa under Article 315 of the RPC, the two crimes form a complex crime under Article 48 of the same law. A complex crime, as earlier defined, may refer to a single act which constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies or to an offense as a necessary means for committing another.
In a complex crime of Estafa Through Falsification of Public, Official or Commercial Document, the falsified document is actually utilized to defraud another. The falsification is already consummated and it is the defraudation which causes damage or prejudice to another that constitutes estafa.
x x x x
After a careful and meticulous scrutiny of the records, the Court finds, and so holds, that the prosecution evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that the following accused are guilty of the offense charged, namely: Arias, Borja, Castillo, Favorito, Quarto, San Jose and Dela Cruz. These accused conspired with one another, and with accused Martinez whose criminal liability has been extinguished by death.
Accused Arias, an OIC Asst. Director of the Bureau of Equipment, affixed his signature approving and/or recommending approval of the falsified Disbursement Vouchers, Reports of Waste Materials, Requisitions for Supplies and/or Equipment (RSE) and Certificates of Emergency Purchase.
[17]
In 
Tanenggee v. People
,
[18]
 this Court discussed the complex crime of estafa through falsification of public documents, thus:
When the offender commits on a public, official or commercial document any of the acts of falsification enumerated in Article 171 as a necessary means to commit another crime like estafa, theft or malversation, the two crimes form a complex crime. Under Article 48 of the RPC, there are two classes of a complex crime. A complex crime may refer to a single act which constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies or to an offense as a necessary means for committing another.
[19]
In 
Domingo v. People
,
[20]
 we held:
The falsification of a public, official, or commercial document may be a means of committing estafa, because before the falsified document is actually utilized to defraud another, the crime of falsification has already been consummated, damage or intent to cause damage not being an element of the crime of falsification of public, official, or commercial document. In other words, the crime of falsification has already existed. Actually utilizing that falsified public, official, or commercial document to defraud another is estafa. But the damage is caused by the commission of estafa, not by the falsification of the document. Therefore, the falsification of the public, official, or commercial document is only a necessary means to commit estafa.
In general, the elements of estafa are: (1) that the accused defrauded another (a) by abuse of confidence or (b) by means of deceit; and (2) that damage or prejudice capable of pecuniary estimation is caused to the offended party or third person. Deceit is the false representation of a matter of fact, whether by words or conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed; and which deceives or is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it, to his legal injury.
[21]
 (Citation omitted.)
It must be emphasized that the falsified documents (Disbursement Vouchers, Reports of Waste Materials, Requisition for Supplies and/or Equipment and Certificates of Emergency Purchase) involved in this case are official or public documents. Public documents are: (a) the written official acts, or records of the official acts of the sovereign authority, official bodies and tribunals, and public officers, whether of the Philippines or of a foreign country; (b) documents acknowledged before a notary public except last wills and testaments; and (c) public records, kept in the Philippines, of private documents required by law to be entered therein.
[22]
 A public document, by virtue of its official or sovereign character, or because it has been acknowledged before a notary public (except a notarial will) or a competent public official with the formalities required by law, or because it is a public record of a private writing authorized by law, is self-authenticating and requires no further authentication in order to be presented as evidence in court.
[23]
 In considering whether the accused is liable for the complex crime of estafa through falsification of public documents, it would be wrong to consider the component crimes separately from each other.
[24]
 While there may be two component crimes (estafa and falsification of public documents), both felonies are animated by and result from one and the same criminal intent for which there is only one criminal liability.
[25]
 That is the concept of a complex crime.
[26]
 In other words, while there are two crimes, they are treated only as one, subject to a single criminal liability.
[27]
 While a conviction for estafa through falsification of public documents requires that the elements of both estafa and falsification exist, it does not mean that the criminal liability for estafa may be determined and considered independently of that for falsification.
[28]
 The two crimes of estafa and falsification of public documents are not separate crimes but component crimes of the single complex crime of estafa and falsification of public documents.
[29]
 In this case, the prosecution was able to prove the elements of the crime.
Petitioner further seeks a review of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses for allegedly being "self-serving" and "perjured."
Findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are generally accorded great respect by an appellate court. Well-settled is the rule that findings of facts and assessment of credibility of witnesses are matters best left to the trial court because of its unique position of having observed that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying, which opportunity is denied to the appellate courts. For this reason, the trial court's findings are accorded finality, unless there appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight which the lower court may have overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated and which, if properly considered, would alter the results of the case.
[30]
At any rate, the records of this case show no reversible error to warrant a reversal of the assailed decision. It appears that petitioner did not impugn his signatures appearing in the Disbursement Vouchers, Reports of Waste Materials, Requisitions for Supplies and/or Equipment and Certificates of Emergency Purchase. Furthermore, the repeated issuance and execution of these documents belies petitioner's claim that his participation was not necessary and that his function in signing documents is merely ministerial; on the contrary, these documents were necessary for the claims for payment of emergency repairs of DPWH service vehicles and/or purchases of spare parts which were found to be fictitious. Thus, petitioner's signatures on these documents were a clear manifestation of his assent and participation or complicity to the illegal transactions, and his assertion of lack of participation is without merit.
With regard to petitioner's contention as to the Best Evidence Rule, or, more specifically, to the Sandiganbayan's admission on the prosecution's exhibits despite the non-presentation of the original documents, such is misplaced. Instructive on this point is the case of 
Citibank, N.A. v. Sabeniano
,
[31]
 wherein this Court stated that:
As the afore-quoted provision states, the best evidence rule applies only when the subject of the inquiry is the contents of the document. The scope of the rule is more extensively explained thus -
But even with respect to documentary evidence, the best evidence rule applies only when the content of such document is the subject of the inquiry. Where the issue is only as to whether such document was actually executed, or exists, or on the circumstances relevant to or surrounding its execution, the best evidence rule does not apply and testimonial evidence is admissible. Any other substitutionary evidence is likewise admissible without need for accounting for the original.
Thus, when a document is presented to prove its existence or condition it is offered not as documentary, but as real, evidence. Parol evidence of the fact of execution of the documents is allowed.
In Estrada v. Desierto, this Court had occasion to rule that -
It is true that the Court relied not upon the original but only [a] copy of the Angara Diary as published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer on February 4-6, 2001. In doing so, the Court, did not, however, violate the best evidence rule. Wigmore, in his book on evidence, states that:
"Production of the original may be dispensed with, in the trial court's discretion, whenever in the case in hand the opponent does not bona fide dispute the contents of the document and no other useful purpose will be served by requiring production.
"xxx         xxx         xxx
"In several Canadian provinces, the principle of unavailability has been abandoned, for certain documents in which ordinarily no real dispute arised. This measure is a sensible and progressive one and deserves universal adoption. Its essential feature is that a copy may be used unconditionally, if the opponent has been given an opportunity to inspect it." x x x
This Court did not violate the best evidence rule when it considered and weighed in evidence the photocopies and microfilm copies of the PNs, MCs, and letters submitted by the petitioners to establish the existence of respondent's loans. The terms or contents of these documents were never the point of contention in the Petition at bar. It was respondent's position that the PNs in the first set (with the exception of PN No. 34534) never existed, while the PNs in the second set (again, excluding PN No. 34534) were merely executed to cover simulated loan transactions. As for the MCs representing the proceeds of the loans, the respondent either denied receipt of certain MCs or admitted receipt of the other MCs but for another purpose. Respondent further admitted the letters she wrote personally or through her representatives to Mr. Tan of petitioner Citibank acknowledging the loans, except that she claimed that these letters were just meant to keep up the ruse of the simulated loans. Thus, respondent questioned the documents as to their existence or execution, or when the former is admitted, as to the purpose for which the documents were executed, matters which are, undoubtedly, external to the documents, and which had nothing to do with the contents thereof.

Here, petitioner's objection to the prosecution's documentary evidence, as stated in his Comment/Objections to Formal Offer of Exhibits,
[33]
 essentially relates to the materiality, relevance or purpose for which the documents were offered which had nothing to do with the contents thereof.
As to petitioner's guilt for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, such has been established beyond reasonable doubt.
Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 reads, as follows:
Section 3. Corrupt practices of public officers. - In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:
x x x x
(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official[,] administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.
The elements of the above violation are:
(1)
 
the offender is a public officer;
(2)
 the act was done in the discharge of the public officer's official, administrative or judicial functions;
(3)
 the act was done through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and
(4)
 the public officer caused any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or gave any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference.
[34]
All the above elements are present in this case. The petitioner is a public officer, being then the Assistant Director of the Bureau of Equipment of DPWH, discharging administrative and official functions. Petitioner and his co-accused acted with evident bad faith by falsifying official documents to defraud the DPWH into paying the claims for fictitious emergency repairs or purchase of spare parts under the name of Julio Martinez. The act of petitioner caused undue injury or damage to the government in the total amount of P5,166,539.00.
Petitioner acted with evident bad faith when he affixed his signature to the falsified documents in order to induce the government to pay the claim for fictitious emergency repairs and purchases of spare parts of certain vehicles. Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud.
[35]
In view, however, of R.A. No. 10951 (An Act Adjusting the Amount or the Value of Property and Damage on which a Penalty is Based, and the Fines Imposed under the Revised Penal Code, amending for the Purpose Act No. 3815, otherwise known as "The Revised Penal Code"), a modification must be made as to the penalty imposed by the Sandiganbayan. Section 85 of the said law provides the following:
SEC. 85. Article 315 of the same Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 4885, Presidential Decree No. 1689, and Presidential Decree No. 818, is hereby further amended to read as follows:
"ART. 315. 
Swindling (estafa)
. - Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:
"
1st. The penalty of 
prision correccional
 in its maximum period to 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period, if the amount of the fraud is over Two million four hundred thousand pesos (P2,400,000) but does not exceed Four million four hundred thousand pesos (P4,400,000), and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional Two million pesos (P2,000,000); but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed 
prision mayor
 or 
reclusion temporal
 as the case may be.
x x x x
"4th. The penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its medium period, if such amount is over Forty thousand pesos (P40,000) but does not exceed One million two hundred thousand pesos (P1,200,000).
"5th. By 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period, if such amount does not exceed Forty thousand pesos (P40,000).
"3. Through any of the following fraudulent means:
"(a) By inducing another, by means of deceit, to sign any document.
"(b) By resorting to some fraudulent practice to insure success in a gambling game.
"(c) By removing, concealing or destroying, in whole or in part, any court record, office files, document or any other papers." (Emphasis ours.)
Applying the above provisions, the maximum term of the penalty that must be imposed should be within the maximum period of 
prision correccional
 maximum to 
prision mayor
 minimum, considering that the amount defrauded is P5,166,539.00 and the crime committed is a complex crime under Article 48 of the RPC, where the penalty of the most serious of the crimes should be imposed which, in this case, is the penalty for Estafa. Hence, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term of the penalty should be within the range of the penalty next lower in degree or 
prision correccional
 minimum to 
prision correccional
 medium and the maximum term should be taken from the maximum period of 
prision mayor
 minimum. Thus, an indeterminate penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of 
prision correccional
 medium, as the minimum term, to eight (8) years of 
prision mayor
 minimum, as the maximum term, is appropriate.
WHEREFORE
, the petition for review on 
certiorari
 dated March 15, 2018 of petitioner Florendo B. Arias is 
DENIED
 for lack of merit. Consequently, the Decision of the Sandiganbayan dated November 10, 2016, in the consolidated Criminal Case No. 28100 and Criminal Case No. 28253, and its Resolution dated January 15, 2018 are 
AFFIRMED
 with the 
MODIFICATION
 that in Criminal Case No. 28100 for Estafa through Falsification of Official/Commercial Documents, petitioner is sentenced to suffer imprisonment of from four (4) years and two (2) months of 
prision correccional
 medium, as minimum, to eight (8) years of 
prision mayor
 minimum, as maximum.
