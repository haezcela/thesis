PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. BOY DOMINGO, JOEL TEMPORAL (AT LARGE), BENEDICTO PEDRO (AT LARGE), HEHERSON RIVERA (AT LARGE), AND JESSING VALDEZ (AT LARGE), ACCUSED. 
 BOY DOMINGO, APPELLANT.
DECISION




PANGANIBAN, J.:


 Appellantâs alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification made by credible witnesses.  Absent any plausible imputation of ill motive on their part to falsely accuse or implicate him, their candid and consistent testimonies should be given full faith and credit.

[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Santiago City (Branch 36)

 in Criminal Case No. 36-2321, finding him guilty of robbery with multiple rape.  The Decision disposed as follows:
âWHEREFORE[,] in light of the foregoing considerations[,] the Court finds the accused Boy Domingo GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with multiple rape and hereby sentences him to the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.  He is also ordered to pay the spouses Valentin Gabertan and Clara Gabertan the total sum of [e]leven [t]housand [t]wo [h]undred [p]esos (P11,200.00) representing the value of the things stolen, plus one [h]undred [t]housand [p]esos (P100,000.00) as moral damages.â

The Facts
Prosecutionâs Version
In its Brief,
[9]
 the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the prosecutionâs version of the facts as follows:
âAround 11:00 p.m. of October 23, 1993, private complainant Valentin Gabertan [âValentinâ] was lounging outside x x x his house while his children [lay] asleep, when he heard the incessant barking of dogs in the compound.
âThe Gabertan compound, located at Sitio Malasin, Balintocatoc, Santiago, Isabela, consist[s] of two (2) main houses; one, where the children and a young houseboy stay and sleep and the other, where Valentin and his wife, Clara [âClaraâ] retire for the evening.  There are also several barns to house the cows, goats and domestic fowls.
âClara, who was then reposed on the bed, heard the barking at the same time. Instinctively, Clara stood up and took out a flashlight.  She immediately gave it to her husband, who was then armed with a bolo [âpanabasâ], to aid him in checking out the disturbance.
âValentin ha[d] not walked far from the house when three (3) men suddenly entered the compound while two (2) others stayed outside.  The men, initially identifying themselves as members of the New Peopleâs Army (NPA), ferociously asked Valentin for money.  Turned off by the demand, Valentin at once retorted that they could not be members of the NPAs as NPAs do not ask for money.
âThe men, however, were unmasked.  Valentin instantly recognized their faces as that of appellant and his co-accused.  It was easy for Valentin to recognize appellant, having known him for the past ten (10) years, as the latter usually pass[ed] by their house when he [went] fishing.  Appellant and his co-accused were each armed with a piece of wood.
âUnruffled by Valentinâs response, appellant and his co-accused nonetheless persisted.  They demanded x x x guns and documents or certificates for the large cattle and asked who the owner of the cows was.
âValentin, however, attempted to ward off the impending danger now reposed [i]n him.  He promptly hacked one of the men [identified as Joel Temporal] on his right arm. A struggle ensued.  Valentin, however, was easily outnumbered by the intruders as the latter clubbed him at the same time.  Valentin soon let go of his defense when the intruders attempted to hurt his son.
âAt this time, Clara sensed an intense level of fear as she stood frozen beside a table where a kerosene lamp was lighted.  It only took a few minutes when Joel Temporal barged in, struck the kerosene lamp and ominously threatened, âI will kill you if you will not give me what I want.â
âJoel Temporal thereafter pulled Clara out of the house where she was forcibly laid on the cogon grass.
âMeantime, Valentin could only watch his wife being pulled away as he was rendered weak and immobile at the clubbing he received at a momentâs resistance. Jessing Valdez and Heherson Rivera stood guard.  His attempt to rescue his wife was overtaken by the necessity to protect the son he was now embracing lest the intruders vent their rage on him.
âClaraâs dress [duster] and panty were torn away.  Her hands were held by appellant and her feet also held by Benedicto Pedro.  Joel Temporal put himself on top of Clara and went inside her.  After he consummated his lust, appellant came in next. Benedicto Pedro also took his turn.  For his part, Jessing Valdez left Valentin and his son and rushed in to satiate, too, his carnal desire.  Once finished, all four (4) men checked on Valentin but came back to see Clara, stepping on her vagina in the process. Agonized, Clara could only utter, âDonât you have pity on me, you people from Bannawag?â
âAppellant and his co-accused thereafter left, bringing with them two (2) chickens and nine (9) turkeys which were carried around their necks.
âValentin rushed to his wifeâs side and could only embrace her.  A few minutes, later, neighbors and friends Leonardo Palafox and Celestino Capa came to their succor. At this time, Valentin had difficulty breathing.  He could not be rushed to the hospital immediately because there was no transport available.
âValentin and Clara had to content themselves to await the dawn.  Back at the house, however, money worth the amount of P5,350.00 and a Seiko gold-plated watch worth P2,000.00 [were] found missing [from] Claraâs bag.
âAt 8:00 a.m. the following morning, Valentin was admitted [to] the Cagayan Valley Sanitarium and Hospital for multiple physical injuries secondary to mauling.  His diagnosis revealed the following injuries:
â1. 2 cm. Hematoma on R and L temporal area
 2. 2 cm. Hematoma on L che[e]k area
 3. [Multiple] Incomplete fracture of 8th and 9th ribs R side.â 
 âClara, on the other hand, was examined at the Outpatient Department.  She sustained âmultiple scratch marks, inner thigh-bilateral, and multiple abraided areas per labia minora.â The certification further indicated:
âSpecular exam. Introitus - Parous
Uterus - Not enlarged
Cervix - Hand & erosion at or [sic]
Adnexae - negative
Discharge - Whitish Mucoidâ
x x x                                         x x x                                  x x x.
âBoth Valentin and Clara exhibited no qualms in identifying the perpetrators of the crime --- pinpointing their neighbors from Bannawag Norte, Santiago City --- Joel Temporal, Benedicto Pedro, appellant Boy Domingo, Heherson Rivera and Jessing Valdez.â

Defenseâs Version
Appellant, on the other hand, argues that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.  His statement of facts is as follows:
âThe defense presented in evidence the testimony of accused Boy Domingo.  He testified that [i]n the month of October 1993, he was harvesting palay somewhere in Barangay Salvador, Santiago City.  On October 23, 1993, he started working at 7:00 oâclock in the morning up to 5:00 oâclock in the afternoon.  Afterwards, he proceeded to the house of his sister.  While in the house of his sister, he rested for [a while], ate supper at 8:00 oâclock in the evening and went to sleep.  After finishing his work on October 31, 1993, he went home to the house of his mother in Bannawag, Santiago City.  He was apprehended on July 27, 1998 while driving a tricycle.
âThe next witness presented was Florentina Pingaron, the sister of accused Boy Domingo.  She testified that her brother Boy Domingo stayed at her place in Salvador, Santiago City from October 3, 199
[3]
 in order to do some harvesting.  Her brother stayed with her for about a month.  On October 23, 199
[3]
 at around 8:00 oâclock in the evening [her] brother was at home sleeping and did not leave the house.  During the month [her] brother stayed with her, he did not leave the place at all except when he [went] to the farm to harvest.
âThe next witness was Pepito Martin who corroborated the testimony of accused-appellant Boy Domingo that the latter worked in his farm from October 5, 1993 up to October 31, 1993.  He claimed that the accused worked on his farm from 7:00 oâclock up to 11:00 oâclock in the morning and from 2:00 oâclock up to 5:00 oâclock in the afternoon.  On October 24, 1993, he saw the accused-appellant harvesting on his farm the whole day.
âThe next witness was Sonny Solomon.  He testified that on October 23, 1993 as well as October 24, 1993 he saw the accused-appellant work [o]n the farm of Mr. Martin because they were together at that time.
âThe last witness for the defense was Barangay Captain Rodante Angel.  He testified that he ha[d] known the accused Boy Domingo Jr. since the latter was a child. According to him, the accused ha[d] no derogatory record at all.  He issued a certification attesting to this fact.â

Ruling of the Trial Court
After careful study and judicious assessment of the evidence submitted by both parties, the RTC ruled that appellant was guilty of the special complex crime of robbery with multiple rape.  It concluded that the principal intention of appellant and his co-accused was to rob complainants,
[12]
 and that the rape was a mere afterthought.
The RTC also held that the alibi of appellant - that he was at his sisterâs house harvesting palay when the crime was committed -- could not prevail over the positive identification made by the victims.
Hence, this appeal.
[13]
The Issue
Appellant assigns this sole alleged error for our consideration:
âThe trial court erred in disregarding the defense of alibi interposed by accused-appellant Boy Domingo.â
[14]
The Courtâs Ruling
The appeal has no merit.
Sole Issue:
Defense of Alibi
Appellant argues that the RTC should not have disregarded his alibi because it was duly supported by testimonies of disinterested persons, not merely of his relatives.
We are not persuaded.  We believe that the RTC did not err in its factual findings. Well-settled is the rule that the assessment by the lower court of the credibility of witnesses is accorded great respect because of its direct opportunity to observe their demeanor during trial.
[15]
 The appellate court, on the other hand, has only the cold and impersonal records of the proceedings to rely upon.
[16]
In the case at bar, the flight and the false alibi of Boy Domingo, as well as complainantsâ positive identification of him, convinced the trial judge of appellantâs culpability of the crime charged.
[17]
Likewise, complainants had a good look at their unmasked
[18]
 assailants,
[19]
 because there was moonlight on that fateful night.
[20]
 It is the most natural reaction of victims of criminal violence to strive to look at the appearances, particularly the faces, of their assailants and observe the manner in which the crime is committed.
[21]
 Most often, the face and body movements of the latter create in the minds of the former lasting impressions that cannot be easily erased from memory.

Before you noticed a light from a distance coming, do you know what did these five (5) persons do after they raped you?
 
 
 
 
A.
 
 
I saw them carrying chickens and turkey, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q. 
 
Where did these persons, who were carrying chickens and turkey, go after you saw th[e]m in that situation?
 
 
 
A. 
 
 
They were going out and left, sir.â
[25]
 
 
Time-tested is the principle that when a woman says she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that she has been so raped.
[26]
 A woman will not expose herself to the humiliation of a trial, with its attendant publicity and the morbid curiosity it would arouse, unless she has been truly wronged and seeks atonement for her abuse.
[27]
On the other hand, appellant insists that the testimonies of the defense witnesses, Pepito Martin and Sonny Solomon, sufficiently proved the impossibility for him to be at the place where the crime was committed and be able to report for work the next day.
[28]
We are not convinced.  Well-settled is the rule that alibi is always viewed with suspicion, because it is inherently weak and unreliable.
[29]
 The defense of alibi assumes significance or strength when it is amply corroborated by a credible witness.
[30]
 For alibi to prosper, the accused must be able to (a) prove his presence at another place at the time of the perpetration of the offense and (b) demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him at that time to have been at the scene of the crime.
[31]
In the case at bar, the alibi of appellant failed to meet these requisites.
[32]
 
First,
 while the two defense witnesses established that he was in Barangay Salvador harvesting palay, both failed to show or to preclude any doubt about the physical impossibility for him to be in complainantsâ house or its immediate vicinity.
[33]
 on that fateful night.
[34]
 Although the place where he claimed to be at the time of the commission of the crime was nine (9) kilometers away from Barangay Balintocatoc, the possibility of being physically present at the crime scene or its immediate vicinity was still there.
[35]
 As correctly pointed out by the RTC, both barangays were easily accessible to tricycle and other motor vehicles.
Second,
 we find incredible the testimony of Pepito Martin that it took 16 days for him and appellant to harvest palay from four-hectare farm.  Thus, it cannot be discounted that it was very easy for appellant to have left Barangay Salvador on the evening of October 23, 1993 to commit the crime.
[36]
Based on the foregoing, the alibi of appellant cannot prevail over the positive identification made by credible witnesses.
[37]
 Absent any plausible imputation of ill motive on their part to falsely accuse or implicate him, their candid and consistent testimonies should be given full faith and credit.
[38]
Crime and Punishment
However, we hold that the RTC should have convicted appellant of robbery with rape instead of robbery with multiple rape.  In the special complex crime of robbery with rape, the true intent of the accused must first be determined, because their intent determines the offense they committed.
[39]
 This felony contemplates a situation where the original intent of the accused was to take, with intent to gain, personal property belonging to another; and rape is committed on the occasion thereof or as an accompanying crime.
[40]
 In other words, the offenders had an intent to take personal property belonging to another, and such intent preceded the rape.
[41]
To sustain a conviction for robbery with rape, it is imperative that the robbery itself must be conclusively established.
[42]
 To support a conviction therefor, proof of the rape alone is not sufficient.
[43]
 Robbery with rape occurs when the following elements are present:  (1) personal property is taken with violence or intimidation against persons, (2) the property taken belongs to another, (3) the taking is done with 
animo lucrandi
, and (4) the robbery is accompanied by rape.
[44]
In the case at bar, all the foregoing elements are present.  The contemporaneous acts of appellant and his co-accused stress the fact that they were initially motivated by 
animus lucrandi.
[45]
 They first demanded guns, moneys and animals from Valentin Gabertan.  Apparently, it was only when they entered the house and saw his wife when they thought of raping her.
[46]
 The prosecution likewise established that appellant and his co-accused took chickens, a watch and money from complainants through violence.
[47]
Pursuant to Article 294, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code
[48]
 which was the applicable law at the time, when robbery with rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two (2) or more persons, the penalty is 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.
In the present case, the crime was committed by five (5) persons with the use of deadly weapons.  However, since the crime was committed on October 23, 1993, prior to the enactment of RA No. 7659
[49]
 and during the effectivity of the constitutional proscription
[50]
 on the imposition of the death penalty, the RTC did not err in imposing 
reclusion perpetua.
The RTC, however, should have ordered appellant to pay actual damages to Spouses Gabertan in the amount of P11,150 - not P11,200 -- because this was the actual value of the things taken from them.
[51]
 It should have also ordered him to pay Clara Gabertan P50,000 as indemnity 
ex delicto
 and P25,000 as exemplary damages, consistent with current jurisprudence.
[52]
We also modify the award of moral damages, which should be reduced to P50,000 consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.
[53]
WHEREFORE, the appeal is 
DENIED
, and the RTC Decision is 
AFFIRMED
, with the 
MODIFICATION
 that appellant is convicted of robbery with rape and shall pay P11,150 as actual damages, P50,000 as indemnity 
ex delicto
, another P50,000 as moral damages and P25,000 as exemplary damages.  Costs against appellant.
SO ORDERED.
