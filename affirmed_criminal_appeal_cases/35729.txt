PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS.
ALBERTO GAORANA Y ERAN,[1]

ACCUSED-APPELLANT. 

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


Minor inconsistencies in the testimony of a witness strengthen, rather
than impair, credibility.  Such harmless
and inconsequential errors are indicative of truth, not falsehood.


The Case


This is an appeal from the Decision
[2]

dated September 4, 1992, promulgated by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of
Panabo, Davao, in Criminal Case Nos. 91-316 and 91-317, convicting Appellant
Alberto Gaorana
[3]


y 
Eran of two counts of rape and sentencing him to two terms of 
reclusiÃ³n
perpetua.


On March 13, 1991, a Criminal Complaint
[4]

was filed by Marivel J. Fuentes with the assistance of her mother, Priscilla J.
Fuentes, before Municipal Trial Court (MTC) Judge Daydews D. Villamor of
Panabo, Davao.  After conducting
preliminary investigation, the MTC recommended that appellant be charged with
two separate cases of simple seduction.  However, in a Resolution dated August 22, 1991,
[5]

Davao State Prosecutor I Castor B. Dorado and Provincial Prosecutor Francisco
G. Rivero modified the investigating judgeâs recommendation and charged
appellant with two counts of rape.  


Except for the dates of the commission of the crime, the two
Informations contained the same allegations.  The first Information, docketed as Crim. Case No. 91-316, charged
appellant as follows:
[6]


âThat on or about March 5, 1991, in the Municipality of Panabo,
Province of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, and with
the use of a hunting knife, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously have carnal knowledge of Marivel Fuentes, against her will.


The commission of the foregoing offense is attended by the
aggravating circumstance of [q]uasi-[r]ecidivism.â


The second Information, docketed as Crim. Case No. 91-317,
charged appellant with rape committed on March 6, 1991.
[7]

The cases were consolidated and filed before the RTC of Panabo, Davao.  Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded not
guilty to both charges.
[8]


In due course, the trial court rendered the assailed Decision,
the dispositive portion of which reads:
[9]


âWHEREFORE, IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, the Court finds
Alberto Gaorana Y Iran guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the two cases of rape,
punishable under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, and this Court hereby
sentences the said accused to suffer and undergo the penalty of 
reclusion
perpetua
 for each count, with all the accessory penalties and to pay the
costs.


The accused is also
ordered to indemnify the victim, Marivel Fuentes, [in] the amount of FIFTY
THOUSAND (P50,000.00) PESOS.â


Hence, this appeal.
[10]


The Facts


Version of the Prosecution


In the Appelleeâs Brief,
[11]

the prosecution presented this version of the facts:
[12]


âOn March 5, 1991, before 2:00 oâclock in the afternoon, Marivel
Fuentes, herein private complainant, was cleaning her house located at DAPECOL,
Panabo, Davao.  At the same time, she
was also putting her younger brother and sister to sleep.  Rowena Sanchez, common-law wife of
appellant, arrived and instructed her to go to her house which was about 20
meters away.
[13]

Private complainant finished cleaning before she proceeded to Rowenaâs place.


When private complainant arrived in appellantâs house, she saw
appellant and Rowena lying down.  Rowena
bade her to come in and told her to sit down.  Rowena then stood up and told private complainant that she [would]
urinate.  Appellant approached private
complainant, covered her mouth and pointed a hunting knife to her neck.  He told her that he [would] kill her if she
[would] tell her mother.  Private
complainant fought appellant but appellant pulled her inside a room.  Appellant made her lie down on the
floor.  Appellant then took off his
pants and opened private complainantâs duster and removed her panty.  He put himself on top of private complainant
and had intercourse with her.  All the
while, private complainantâs mouth was covered with a handkerchief.


After about five minutes, Rowena came back and saw appellant
still on top of Marivel.  Appellant
instructed Rowena to step out of the room.  After a while, appellant stood up, put on his briefs and called his wife
inside the room.  Both of them said,
âLet us see.â


Private complainant was allowed to leave appellantâs house at
5:00 oâclock in the afternoon.  Private
complainantâs parents arrived at 7:00 oâclock in the evening but she did not
report the incident to them because she was afraid appellant might make good
his threat (pp. 7-13, 20-24, 29-32, tsn, March 30, 1992).


The second incident of rape occurred at around 3:00 oâclock in
the morning of March 6, 1991.  Private
complainant was sleeping in the sala with her brother and sister when she was
awakened by the kisses of appellant.  Appellant had a knife which scared private complainant.  Appellant pulled private complainant from
the mat, removed his pants, opened her duster and removed her panty, and again
had intercourse with her.  Private
complainant did not shout because she was afraid of appellant who was a
prisoner and had already killed somebody.  After satisfying his lust, appellant left (pp. 14, 34-36, tsn, ibid.).â


Version of the Defense


Appellant interposes the defense of alibi and denial.  In his Brief,
 
[14]
 
he presented the following
version of the facts:


âEVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE:


MRS. ROWENA GAORANA testified that she is the wife of the accused
Alberto Gaorana, and they have one (1) child.  She had known the accused since 1989 and had become his sweetheart since
May 26, 1990.  Gaorana [was] a living
out prisoner which means that he [was] living in a house outside the compound
of DAPECOL.  She became a resident of
DAPECOL since 1989 when she was then living with her mother and stepfather who
[was] likewise a colonist.  She knew
Marivel Fuentes because they [had been] neighbors since she arrived in DAPECOL
in December 2, 1989.  She was then 16
years old.  She and Marivel Fuentes
[were] friends, and as such, they would talk sometimes and would practice how
to ride on a bicycle.


It is not true that she invited Marivel Fuentes to visit their
house in DAPECOL at about 2 p.m. of March 5, 1991 because at that time and
date, they were sleeping.  However, on
that date, she could recall having met Marivel Fuentes in their house, when
Marivel borrowed a pitcher from them.  After borrowing the pitcher, Marivel left and she continued sleeping.  Then she stood up and went to her motherâs
house 300 meters away to answer the call of nature.  After 45 minutes she returned and saw Marivel Fuentes sitting in
their kitchen.  Her husband was also
sitting on the bench of their kitchen, two (2) meters away from where Marivel
was and conversing with the latter.  She
could not however hear what they were talking about.  She asked Marivel Fuentes why she was there and Marivel answered
that she was returning the pitcher she borrowed.  She noticed that Marivel was somewhat embarrassed because she
turned her face from her.  Then after
around 30 minutes, Marivel went home.


It is not true that she just laughed when she saw them doing the
sexual intercourse because if it were true that she saw them doing that thing,
maybe she would kill.


It is not also true that on [the] midnight of March 6, 1991, her
common-law husband Alberto Gaorana barged in[to] the house of Marivel Fuentes
and had sexual intercourse with her, because at that time, they were sleeping
in the room of their house.


Whenever she would meet Marivel Fuentes after March 5 and 6, 1991,
they just looked at each other.  Marivel
would not talk to her because she believe[d] she was ashamed.  She asked Marivel why she did not care to
answer.  That was not the usual behavior
of Marivel  prior to March 5 and 6,
because they used to talk and laugh together whenever they were in
company.  She also asked her husband why
[I]nday (referring to Marivel) changed and her husband answered âI do not know
why.  You may know it because you are
close to each other.â  (TSN, June 1,
1992, pp. 3-14


Accused ALBERTO GAORANA, 27 years old, live-in partner of Rowena
and a prisoner, testified that he came to know Marivel Fuentes in 1989.  He met her in their store, being a living
but prisoner, [and] he worked as a carpenter in the house of Fuentes family in
DAPECOL in 1990.


At about 2 p.m. of March 5, 1991, he was in their house sleeping
with his common-law-wife.  He woke up at
4 0âclock in the afternoon.  His wife
was still with him when he woke up.  On
said date he did not see or meet Marivel Fuentes.  What Marivel Fuentes are [sic] saying against him are not true
because he was sleeping at that time with his wife.  (TSN, June 1, 1992, pp. 17-19).â


Ruling of the Trial Court


The trial court gave full faith and credence to the testimony of
complainant who was not shown to have any motive to falsely testify against
appellant.  It ruled that it was
improbable that a naive and inexperienced 15-year old girl would fabricate her
own ravishment and subject herself to the humiliation and embarrassment of a
public trial if her charges were not true.  Further, her testimony was corroborated by Dr. Bendijo who, after
conducting physical examination on her, found that her hymen was no longer
intact.  Her positive and categorical
testimony prevailed over appellantâs bare denial and alibi.


The trial court also ruled that appellant had a motive to commit
the crime.  Complainantâs parents
supposedly failed to give him their payment for his common-law wifeâs laundry
services.


Assignment of Errors


In his Brief, appellant imputes the following errors to the court

a quo
:
[15]


âI


The trial court erred
in finding the testimony of Complainant Marivel Fuentes as credible despite its
inconsistencies


II


The trial court erred
in finding Accused-Appellant Alberto Gaorana guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
the crime of rape despite the weakness of the evidence for the prosecutionâ


The Courtâs Ruling


The appeal is bereft of merit.


First Issue: 
Harmless Inconsistencies


Appellant contends that the following âinconsistenciesâ cast
serious doubt on the veracity and reliability of complainantâs testimony:  (1) complainant declared that her father
wanted her to be away from DAPECOL (Davao Penal Colony), but she also claimed
that he was happy when she returned because he missed her terribly;
[16]

(2) on cross-examination, she testified that it took Rowena five minutes to
answer the call of nature
[17]

but, later on, she said that Rowena returned after an hour;
[18]

(3) during the direct examination she said that appellant âopenedâ her house
dress,
[19]

but on cross-examination she said that he pulled her house dress up to her
breast;
[20]

and (4) she claimed that appellant had already pulled his penis out of her
vagina when Rowena returned, which was at the same time that complainant opened
her eyes
[21]

-- a statement contradicting her earlier one which pointed out that appellantâs
penis was still inside her private part when Rowena saw the two of them.
[22]


The alleged discrepancies do not discredit the complainantâs
testimony.  The claimed inconsistency
regarding the fatherâs reaction to the complainantâs return to DAPECOL is more
apparent than real.  Her father, being
an inmate himself, must have realized that the penal colony was not an ideal
place for a girl to grow up in; thus, he welcomed the possibility that his
daughter would live outside the colony with her aunt.  By the same token, he cannot be faulted for missing a daughter
whom he had not seen for some time.  


Equally insignificant is the discrepancy regarding complainantâs
account of the length of time it took Rowena to defecate and return.  This is a minor lapse which is not unusual
when a person is recounting a humiliating and painful experience.  


On the other hand, whether the complainantâs house dress was
âopenedâ or âpulled upâ is merely a semantic discrepancy.  It could very well be attributed to an error
in the translation of the testimony from the dialect to English.  In any case, both terms similarly describe
how appellant exposed the complainantâs body to enable him to commit the
crime.  


Whether appellantâs penis was still inside complainantâs vagina
when Rowena returned is similarly a trivial matter.  In either case, it is undisputed that appellant, with the use of
force and intimidation, had carnal knowledge of the complainant.


These alleged inconsistencies are inconsequential in the face of
the essential fact that appellant forced the complainant to have sexual
intercourse with him.  The Court has
consistently adhered to the rule that inconsistencies on minor details
strengthen, rather than impair, the witnessâ credibility.  They are considered more as badges of truth,
rather than as indicia of falsehood.
[23]


Appellant also contends that the testimony of complainant was
contrary to human experience, because he could not have stayed at her house for
thirty minutes just threatening her and doing nothing else, after he had
supposedly ravished her for two minutes around 3:00 a.m. of March 6, 1991.  The Court is not persuaded.  


Rape is essentially an offense committed in secrecy, generally
executed in dark or deserted and secluded places away from prying eyes.  Thus, conviction for this crime rests
largely upon the credibility of the offended party who is usually the sole
witness of its actual occurrence.
[24]

Thus, herein complainantâs testimony must thus be considered and calibrated in
its entirety, and not by truncated portions or isolated passages thereof.
[25]


The complainant cannot be faulted for her inability to do
anything, while appellant continuously threatened her for thirty minutes after
he had defiled her body.  She has more
than sufficiently explained that she was deeply distressed and overcome with
fear.  In 
People vs. Pontilar, 
the
Court stated:
[26]


âIt is a truism that âthe workings of the human mind placed under a
great deal of emotional and psychological stress are unpredictable, and
different people react differently.  There is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is
confronted with a strange, startling, frightful or traumatic experience xxx.ââ


The assessment of a witnessâ credibility has always been
considered to be the province of the trial court.  After all, the trial judge had the opportunity, which appellate
courts do not have, to observe the witnessâ demeanor and deportment on the
stand.
[27]

In the case at bar, appellant failed to show any cogent reason to justify a
departure from this time-honored rule.


Second Issue: 
Evidence  of Guilt Sufficient


Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any
of the following circumstances: (1) when force or intimidation is used; (2)
when the woman is deprived of reason or is  otherwise unconscious; and (3) when the woman is under twelve years of
age.
[28]

The prosecution established that appellant raped the complainant the first time
in the following manner:
[29]


âQ
   
After you laid [sic] down
because Alberto Gaorana pointed a knife on [sic] your neck, what did Alberto
Gaorana do to you?


A
     
He removed his pants.

x x x 


Q
    
Now, when Alberto Gaorana
succeeded in removing your panty, what did Alberto Gaorana do to you?


A
     
After he removed my
panty, he put himself on top of me xxx.


x x x
               
x
x x
                 
x x x


Q
    
Was the penis of Alberto
Gaorana able to penetrate xxx your vagina?


A
     
Yes, sir.


       
x x x 
              
x x x 
                
x
x x 


Q
    
Now, can you tell this
Honorable Court how long did Alberto Gaorana sexually abused [sic] you?


A
     
About 5 minutes.â
(Underscoring supplied.)


The perpetration of rape for the second time was also
established:
[30]


âQ
   
Now can you tell this
Honorable Court what happened on March 6, 1991 at 3:00 oâclock in the morning?


A
     
I was surprised [at] the
kisses made to me by Alberto Gaorana and he was bringing [sic] a hunting knife
and that was the reason I was awakened.


       
x x x 
              
x x x 
                
x
x x


Q
    
When you were brought to
the floormat [sic], what did Alberto Gaorana do?


A
     
He removed his pants.


Q
    
Then, what did he do?


A
     
He opened my duster.


       
x x x
               
x x x
                 
x
x x


Q
    
And you said that you
were sexually abused by Alberto Gaorana, was he able to penetrate on [sic] your
vagina?


A
     
Yes, sir.â (Underscoring
supplied.)


The complainant positively identified appellant as her
ravisher.  The first rape was committed
in the afternoon at appellantâs house where there was sufficient light to
identify the culprit.  Despite the
relatively dark 
situs
 when the second rape was committed, complainant
knew that the malefactor was appellant because there was sufficient moonlight;
besides, she was familiar with him, as he had been their neighbor for a long
time.  As held in 
People vs.
Castillo,
[31]


identification is facilitated by the fact that the person has gained
familiarity with another.


Appellantâs alibi that he was at home sleeping during the second
incident is negligible, because he failed to prove the physical impossibility
of his presence at the scene of the crime.  His house and that of the complainant were only 20 meters apart.  Further, it was undisputed that appellant
had access to the house of the complainant because he had constructed its door.
[32]


The trial court ruled that appellant had a motive in raping the
complainant.  This is a surplusage,
considering that motive is not necessary in rape cases when the felon has been
positively identified.  Appellant
alleged that the complainantâs mother instigated the charges against him,
because she did not pay for the laundry services of his common-law wife.  Such bizarre reasoning does not explain why
a mother would subject her young daughter to the shame, scandal, embarrassment
and anxiety concomitant with a prosecution for rape.  Indeed, complainant and her mother could not have been impelled
by any motive other than to bring to justice the author of the sexual assault.
[33]


In sum, no evidence has been presented to show that Marivel or
her mother fabricated the charges against appellant.


Quasi-Recidivism Was Not Established


The two Informations alleged that both instances of rape were
attended by the aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism.  The trial court made no express ruling that
appellant was a quasi-recidivist, and rightly so.  During the trial, the prosecution manifested that appellant had
been convicted by the Regional Trial Court of Kabangkalan, Negros Occidental in
Crim. Case No. 013 on March 29, 1988 and was serving sentence for the crime of
homicide.
[34]

However, the prosecution failed or neglected to present in evidence the record
of appellantâs previous conviction.  Quasi-recidivism, like recidivism and 
reiteracion
, necessitates
the presentation of a certified copy of the sentence convicting an accused.
[35]

The fact that appellant was an inmate of DAPECOL does not prove that final
judgment had been rendered against him.
[36]


Civil Indemnity Improperly Imposed


The trial court erred in imposing on appellant civil indemnity of
only 
P
50,000.  Appellant should
pay indemnity of 
P
50,000 for each count of rape.
[37]

Because he was convicted of two counts of rape, he should indemnify the victim
in the amount of 
P
100,000.


WHEREFORE
, the appeal is hereby 
DENIED
.  The assailed Decision is 
AFFIRMED 
with
the
 MODIFICATION
 that appellant is 
ORDERED
 to 
PAY 
the
offended party civil indemnity in the amount of 
P
100,000.  Costs against appellant

within the reglementary period which expired August 10, 1994 (
