PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. RHODELINE CASTILLON, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

PANGANIBAN, J.:


In these difficult times, many Filipinos pin their hopes for an abundant future on overseas employment. In several cases, however, illegal recruiters have taken undue advantage of simple folk desperate to work abroad. This Court cannot let these vultures roam the countryside and prey on the gullibility of our people.
The Case
Rhodeline Castillon appeals the December 8, 1995 Decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 17, which convicted her of large-scale illegal recruitment and imposed upon her the penalty of life imprisonment plus a fine of P100,000.
Prosecutor Emilio G. Dayanghirang III charged appellant in an Information dated January 9, 1995, which we quote:
"The undersigned [charges] the above-named accused [with] the crime of [i]llegal [r]ecruitment [on a] large [s]cale under Article 38 in relation to Article 39 of Presidential Decree No. 2018, committed as follows:
"That sometime in November, 1994, in the City of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-mentioned accused, representing [her]self to have the capacity to contract, enlist and recruit workers for employment abroad, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously for a fee, recruit and promise employment/job placement abroad to Emily B. Perturbos, Nelia B. Perturbos, Ma. Dahlia S. Acol and Clemencia Bula-ag by charging fees, [without] being authorized by the rules/regulations set forth by the Department of Labor and Employment or its instrumentality.
[2]
Assisted by Counsel 
de Oficio
 Juan Zamora of the Public Attorney's Office, appellant pleaded not guilty during her arraignment on February 14, 1995.
[3]
 Trial ensued in due course. On December 8, 1995, the court
 a quo
 rendered its assailed Decision, the decretal portion of which reads:
"WHEREFORE, finding the evidence of prosecution, more than sufficient to prove the guilt of accused, Rhodeline Castillon y Lozada of the offense charged, pursuant to Art. 38 in relation to Art 39(a) of PD No. 442, [the] New Labor Code as amended by PD No. 2018 [, the] accused, Rhodeline Castillon, is sentenced to suffer a penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P100,000.00, in favor of government.
"Moreover, pursuant to Art. 100 in relation to Art. 104 of the Revised Penal Code, covering civil indemnity, [the] accused is ordered to pay each of the complainants, Emily Perturbos, Nelia Perturbos, Maria Dahlia Acol, [and] Clemencia Bula-ag, the amount of P4,000.00 received by [the] accused, in consideration of her aborted promise[s], to secure employment of complainants abroad."
[4]
The Facts 
Version of the Prosecution
The solicitor general summarized the prosecution's version of the facts as follows:
"On November 12, 1994, Emily Perturbos met Rhodeline Castillon at the Magsaysay Park, Davao City (TSN, March 20, 1995, pp. 3-4). Castillon invited and convinced Perturbos to work with her as factory worker in Malaysia (ibid, p. 4). Perturbos accepted her offer because Castillon promised that she would take care of the necessary papers for her (Ibid). Castillon told Perturbos that P8,000.00 would [cover] the processing and placement fees (ibid). Castillon asked from Perturbos P4,000.00 as partial payment therefor (Ibid.).
On November 14, 1994, Perturbos gave Castillon P4,000.00 at the Trader's Inn, Uyangoran, Davao City, where Castillon had checked in (Ibid, pp. 4, 5 & 7). Thereafter, Perturbos again gave Castillon P4,000.00 (Ibid, pp. 5-6).
Castillon promised Perturbos that she would leave for Manila on December 26, 1994, where they would get their tickets for Malaysia.
Castillon was also able to recruit Nelia Perturbos, Maria Dahlia Acol and Clemencia Bala-ag by making the same promise , and she asked from them P4,000.00 each as partial payment for the processing and placement fees (TSN, March 28, 1995, pp. 4-8, 17-20 & 27-30). They paid Castillon P4,000.00 each in their desire to work abroad (Ibid).
When December 26, 1994 came, Castillon, informed her recruits that they would leave for Manila on January 2, 1995, instead (Ibid; March 20, 1995, p. 7). But when January 2, 1995 came, Castillon failed to show up (Ibid.).
Nelia Perturbos inquired from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administrations whether she had a license to recruit overseas worker[s] (Ibid, March 28, 1995, p. 25). In response, the POEA issued a certification declaring that Castillon had no license to recruit overseas workers (Ibid; Exhibit A).
On January 7, 1995, the recruits reported Castillon's illegal activities to the police authorities (TSN, April 17, 1995, pp. 4-6)."
Version of the Defense
In her Brief,
[5]
 appellant presents the following version of the facts:
"[The a]ccused vehemently denied the accusation imputed [to] her. [She] testified that sometime in 1993 she left the Philippines for Singapore and was able to work there as a bookkeeper. After working in Singapore for a year, she went back to her former job as a bookkeeper in Tacurong. Sometime in November 1994, while [she] was awaiting for her departure [for] Singapore, [she] met private complainant, Emily Perturbos, whom she first met in Suralla, Cotabato in 1993. Emily Perturbos requested the accused-appellant for assistance because the former likewise want[ed] to go to Singapore with her. Private complainant even invited the accused-appellant to her house on November 12, 1994, and there and then, Emily Perturbos informed her mother that whether the latter like[d] it or not, she [would] find ways in order to go to Singapore. Although at first hesitant, [the] accused-appellant expressed her intention to assist Emily Perturbos in going to Singapore but she reminded the private complainant that they [would] be entering Singapore as tourists. (TSN, July 21, 1995, pp. 4-16).
"Elated with the prospect of going abroad, Emily Perturbos called by long distance her sister, Nelia Perturbos and informed [her] that she ha[d] a friend in the person of herein accused-appellant who could assist them in finding work abroad. Emily Perturbos then introduced three (3) other persons to herein accused-appellant, including her sister, Nelia Perturbos, and requested the accused to likewise extend assistance to these three (3) persons. (Ibid, p.15)"
Ruling of the Trial Court
In convicting appellant, the trial court found that the victims paid the appellant P4,000 each, because of her fraudulent representation that she could provide them employment abroad. It ruled:
"There is no doubt in the records from the evidence of the prosecution [that the] accused solicited, canvassed and demanded payment from all complainants, the partial amount of P4,000.00, in consideration of a promised employment abroad, through the efforts and influence of [the] accused herself. The denial of [the] accused, explaining she did not recruit complainants but she merely help[ed] them for humanitarian reason, cannot be accepted. The records will show, she herself took the initiative of going with complainant [to] Mangagoy, Surigao del Sur, in order to receive from Emily and Nelia Perturbos the above-advance payments[;] while in the case of Acol and Bula-ag, she personally went to the[ir] parents x x x to make representations and assurances [that] she [would] be responsible [for] providing employment [for] them abroad."
[6]
The Issue
The defense imputes to the trial court this lone error:
"The court a quo erred in finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of large scale illegal recruitment.
In other words, appellant is challenging the sufficiency of the prosecution's evidence.
The Court's Ruling 
The appeal is devoid of merit.
Main Issue:
Sufficiency of Prosecution Evidence
Large-scale illegal recruitment has the following essential elements:
"(1) The accused undertook [a] recruitment activity defined under Article 13(b) or any prohibited practice under Art. 34 of the Labor Code.
"(2) He did not have the license or the authority to lawfully engage in the recruitment and placement of workers.
"(3) He committed the same against three or more persons, individually or as a group."
[7]
Article 13 (b) of the Labor Code defines recruitment and placement as follows:
"xxx [A]ny act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring workers [which] includes referrals, contact services, promis[es] or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not: Provided, That any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement."
The prosecution evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that the foregoing elements were present in this case. There is no question that appellant did not have a license to engage in the recruitment of workers, as she herself admitted,
[8]
 and that the crime was committed against more than three persons. Appellant merely contends that she did not engage in the recruitment and placement of workers. Her argument is belied, however, by the evidence on record.
For a fee, appellant promised to find overseas work for Prosecution Witness Emily Perturbos, who testified:

Q.

'Received the amount of P4,000.00 from Ma. Da[h]lia Acol, for partial payment for the processing for her paper. 
Rhodeline Castillon. Recruiter
.'
[12]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
The above-quoted testimonies unequivocally prove that appellant promised to the three complainants jobs in Malaysia, provided they would each pay P4,000 initially and, upon confirmation of their flight, an additional P4,000. The fact that each of them paid the initial amount of P4,000 is evidenced by the receipts issued and signed by the appellant. Although the latter questioned the genuineness of the said documents, she admitted during the trial that she received the amount.
[13]
In her defense, appellant avers that she was merely helping the complainants find jobs abroad for humanitarian reasons. Because she had been abroad before, she was allegedly "begged" by the complainants to help them find overseas employment. Furthermore, she could not have been a recruiter, because she herself was an applicant for an overseas job, for which she had been recruited by an agency in Manila.
Appellant's arguments are not convincing. 
First
, recruitment includes "any act of canvassing, x x x contracting, x x x promising or advertising for employment abroad, for profit or not." 
Second
, it is clear that she demanded money from persons seeking employment abroad. In committing the challenged acts, she was working not with a recruitment agency, but with her aunt Maricor Acosta. This is clearly proven by a letter, signed by the latter, informing the complainants that their papers were indeed being processed. Contradicting appellant's claim that her acts were motivated by humanitarian reasons, the handwritten letter reads:
[14]
"December 31, 1994
Dear Inday,
Happy New Year! I'm sure that you're very eager to come here and go abroad already. Supposedly, I understand you and your plan in life but kung pwede ang schedule mo ay sa March or April na. 
Please lang day, understand us naman ikaw lang and inaasahan namin diyan sa Mindanao at dagdagan mo pa and mga applicants mo
.
Regarding your applicants, their schedule are as follows and they must know this so that hindi sila mag-alanganin sa atin. 1) Clemencia Bula-ag is on February 18 tentative pa iyan ill just send telegram para hindi na siya mag-stay ng matagal, she must arrive here on before her flight to Singapore. 2) Dahlia Acol is same as Bula-ag 3) Emily Perturbos is first week pa sa March same as her sister Nelia Perturbos 4) Juancho Hesus hindi pa mapirmahan ang kanyang working permit, but dont you worry ginagawa ko ang lahat ng paraan para magkaroon siya ng working visa. Tell them not to worry they can all came to abroad to fulfill their dreams and be sure that they are all in good health.
About their remaining balance of processing will you please collect them so that maipadala mo dito sa akin especially Bula-ag, Acol & Emily para matapos na lahat ang papers nila para pagdating nila dito hindi na sila magtagal dito, kung pwede gawin mo ito ng madali. I'll just send your allowance on January kasi pupunta kami bukas sa Singapore to meet your sister Gerlyn, hindi ko pa alam ang balik ko sa Manila, asikasuhin ko ang mga papers ng applicants mo & please see the xerox copy of their passports. See you kung gusto mo, ihatid mo sila sa Maynila basta ikaw by March or April pa.
MARICOR ACOSTA
1903 Visayan Avenue
Balic Balic Sampaloc
Manila"
The letter reveals that appellant was looking for more applicants in the Mindanao area. This is consonant with the testimony of Nelia Perturbos that because appellant had not yet reached her quota, the latter persuaded her and her sister to apply for jobs abroad.
[15]
Appellant's recruitment of four persons despite her lack of authority or license to do so is uncontroverted. She is thus guilty of large-scale illegal recruitment as defined and penalized in Articles 38(b) and 39(a) of the Labor Code, which provide:
"ART 38. Illegal Recruitment. - (a) Any recruitment activities, including the prohibited practices enumerated under Article 34 of this Code, to be undertaken by non-licensees or non-holders of authority shall be deemed illegal and punishable under Article 39 of this Code. The Ministry of Labor and Employment or any law enforcement [officer] may initiate complaints under this Article.
(b) Illegal recruitment when committed by a syndicate or in large scale shall be considered an offense involving economic sabotage and shall be penalized in accordance with Article 39 hereof.
Illegal recruitment is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out by a group of three (3) or more persons conspiring and/or confederating with one another in carrying out any unlawful or illegal transaction, enterprise or scheme defined under the first paragraph hereof. Illegal recruitment is deemed committed in large scale if committed against three (3) or more persons individually or as a group."
ART 39. Penalties - (a) The penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000) shall be imposed if illegal recruitment constitutes economic sabotage as defined herein.
xxx xxx xxx"
Be that as it may, no effort to bring Maricor Acosta to justice has been communicated to this Court. We are therefore directing the Office of the Clerk of Court to furnish the justice secretary a copy of this Decision, so that he may take appropriate steps to prosecute her, if so warranted in the premises.
