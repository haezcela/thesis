PUNO, J.:


This is an appeal assailing the Decision of 
the Regional Trial Court of 
Urdaneta, Pangasinan, Branch 46, finding appellant Ferdinand Cercado y 
Mozada 
guilty of violating Section 4, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 
6425, as 
amended by R.A. No. 7659, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 

Reclusion Perpetua
 and to pay a fine of 
P1,000,000.00 without any 
subsidiary penalty.



Appellant is charged under the following Information:


âThat on or about November 5, 1999, in the evening, at Barangay
 Calipangpang 
(
sic
), Pozorrubio, Pangasinan, and within the 
jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there wilfully, 
unlawfully and feloneously (sic) sell one (1) brick (of) marijuana dried
 leaves, 
a prohibited drug, wrapped in a white plastic bag and weighing one (1) 
kilo, 
without the necessary permit or authority to do so.


CONTRARY to Sec. 4, Art. II, R. A. No. 6425, as amended by R. 
A. No. 
7659.â
[1]




Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded âNot Guiltyâ and then 
underwent 
trial.


The prosecution presented the testimony of the following 
witnesses: PO2 Edgar 
C. Torres, PO2 Teogenes N. Perez, P/Supt. Theresa Ann Bugayong-Cid, and 
P/Sr. 
Inspector Christopher N. Abrahano.


PO2 Edgar C. Torres testified that he was one of the elements 
of the First 
Regional Narcotics Office, Philippine National Police (PNP) Narcotics 
Group who 
arrested appellant by acting as poseur-buyer in a buy-bust operation on 5
 
November 1999 at Brgy. Alipangpang, Pozorrubio, Pangasinan. He recounted
 that 
while he was in his office at San Fernando City, La Union in the morning
 of 5 
November 1999, a civilian confidential informant reported that he could 
buy one 
(1) kilo of marijuana from a certain âAlyas Imokâ (who later turned out 
to be 
appellant Ferdinand Cercado y Mozada) of Brgy. Alipangpang, Pozorrubio, 
Pangasinan. He relayed this information to his Team Leader, P/Insp. 
Christopher 
N. Abrahano, who evaluated the report and ordered a buy-bust operation. 
P/Insp. 
Abrahano designated PO2 Torres as poseur-buyer and gave him the boodle 
money 
consisting of one (1) P1,000.00 bill
[2]
 
and two (2) P500.00 bills.
[3]
 P/Insp. 
Abrahano, PO2 Rolando C. Navarette and PO2 Teogenes N. Perez were to act
 as 
back-up arresting officers. He narrated that the team thereafter 
proceeded to 
the PNP Pozorrubio Station to coordinate with the local police in charge
 with 
the narcotics operations in the area. He presented a Memorandum
[4]
 addressed to the Chief
 of Police of 
Pozorrubio to prove that they in fact coordinated with the latter. After
 the PNP 
of Pozorrubio entered the Memorandum in the blotter, the team proceeded 
to the 
house of appellant at around 5:00 oâclock in the afternoon. Upon 
reaching the 
house of appellant, the confidential informant introduced PO2 Torres to 
âAlyas 
Imokâ as an interested buyer of one (1) kilo of marijuana which 
appellant priced 
at P2,000.00 per kilo. Appellant told PO2 Torres and the confidential 
informant 
to wait for him and left the house. They waited in front of the house of
 
appellant for about four (4) hours. When appellant arrived at around 
9:00 
oâclock in the evening, he handed a plastic bag to PO2 Torres and 
demanded for 
the payment. PO2 Torres, in turn, gave appellant the P2,000.00 boodle 
money. 
After having ascertained that the material inside the plastic bag was 
marijuana, 
PO2 Torres lighted a cigarette, the pre-arranged signal, and his back-up
 
arresting officers rushed to arrest the appellant. PO2 Perez recovered 
the 
boodle money and the brick of marijuana from appellant. After the 
arrest, the 
team, together with appellant, went back to the PNP Pozorrubio Station 
to 
blotter the case. Subsequently, they proceeded to their sub-office in 
Nancayasan, Urdaneta City for proper investigation. The Booking 
Sheet,
[5]
 Arrest 
Report, Affidavit of Arrest
[6]
 and other documents relevant to the filing 
of the case were prepared in this office.
[7]
 


PO2 Teogenes N. Perez, also a policeman assigned at the First 
Regional 
Narcotics Office, testified that he was one of the back-up arresting 
officers 
who arrested appellant. He corroborated the testimony of PO2 Torres on 
material 
points. From his position as back-up arresting officer, he recounts that
 he and 
his teammates strategically positioned themselves at a store near the 
house of 
appellant. From where he was, he saw appellant, PO2 Torres and the 
confidential 
informant talking with each other. At around 9:20 oâclock in the 
evening, or 
after an interval of about four (4) hours, PO2 Torres lit a cigarette, 
their 
pre-arranged signal. They rushed to apprehend appellant, conducted a 
body search 
and found the P2,000.00 boodle money in his possession. He also 
identified the 
brick of marijuana that they confiscated from appellant as the same 
brick of 
marijuana on exhibit and likewise identified one of the signatures in 
the 
wrapper of the marijuana as his own.
[8]




P/Supt. Theresa Ann Bugayong-Cid, a Forensic Chemist at the PNP
 Regional 
Crime Laboratory Office of San Fernando City, La Union testified that 
they 
submitted to her one (1) white plastic bag with markings containing one 
(1) 
brick of suspected dried marijuana leaves and seeds, weighing 905.3 
grams. Based 
on a Physical Science Report, the specimen was found positive for the 
presence 
of marijuana, a prohibited drug.
[9]
 


P/Sr. Inspector Christopher N. Abrahano, the Team Leader of the
 Narcotics 
Group on the buy-bust operation, testified and corroborated the 
testimonies of 
PO2 Torres and PO2 Perez. He added that they arrived at the scene of the
 
buy-bust operation at around 5:30 oâclock in the afternoon. He also said
 that he 
saw appellant leave and proceed at the back of his house. After waiting 
for more 
or less three (3) hours, he saw PO2 Torres light a cigarette, their 
pre-arranged 
signal. He and his men proceeded to apprehend the appellant, informed 
him of his 
constitutional rights and found in his possession the boodle money and a
 brick 
of marijuana which he identified as the same ones on exhibit. He further
 stated 
that they were only able to know the identity of appellant after he was 
apprehended. After the arrest, they brought appellant to their 
sub-office in 
Nancayasan, Urdaneta City for proper documentation. They also requested 
for 
medical and physical examination and made necessary receipts for the 
confiscated 
items. The confiscated brick of marijuana was subjected to a field test 
using 
the Narcotics Test Disposakit Identification which gave positive result 
to the 
test for Tetre Hydrocanabinol (THC). He identified the Certification of 
Field 
Test on exhibit.
[10]
 After conducting the 
field test, they indorsed the marijuana for laboratory 
examination.


The defense presented the sole testimony of appellant. He 
testified that on 5 
November 1999, the time the alleged incident took place, he was inside 
his house 
at Brgy. Alipangpang, Pozorrubio, Pangasinan. At around 7:00 oâclock in 
the 
evening, three (3) unidentified men allegedly entered and ransacked his 
house. 
He was then with his wife and two (2) children. He narrates that the 
three (3) 
men had guns and one of them was carrying a bag. Appellant asked for 
their names 
but got no reply. After searching the whole house without presenting any
 
warrant, the three men brought appellant outside and asked him to admit 
possession of the marijuana inside the bag that one of them was 
carrying. They 
likewise asked appellant to give them P5,000.00. When he refused to 
admit and 
give them money, the three (3) men beat him up and later brought him to 
the 
âbarangayâ.
[11]
 He
 later learned that one 
of them was PO2 Perez. He never knew the names of the two (2) others, 
except 
that he remembers they have IDâs and thinks that they are policemen. On 
cross-examination, appellant maintained that the brick of marijuana was 
merely 
planted by the police operatives.
[12]






The court 
a quo
 found appellant guilty as 
charged. Hence, this 
appeal.


In his Brief, appellant assigns the following 
errors:


âI




THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE 
TESTIMONIES OF 
PROSECUTION WITNESSES PO2 EDGAR TORRES, PO2 TEOGENES PEREZ AND P/SR. 
INSPECTOR 
CHRISTOPHER NORTES ABRAHANO.


II




THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE PROSECUTION 
MISERABLY FAILED TO 
PROVE THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED BEYOND RASONABLE (sic) DOUBT.â
[13]




On the first assignment of error, appellant contends that the 
version of the 
prosecution is not credible. He considers it contrary to human 
experience and 
beyond comprehension that appellant would openly sell marijuana, a 
prohibited 
drug, to people he hardly knew, to the point of exposing himself to a 
possible 
arrest. He likewise argues that the failure of the prosecution to 
identify and 
present the confidential informant weakens the case against him, citing 
the case 
of 
People vs. Rojo.
[14]




On the second assignment of error, appellant contends, that 
granting 
arguendo, he sold one (1) kilo of dried marijuana leaves, the evidence 
remains 
insufficient to convict him since the prosecution failed to prove that 
he had no 
legal authority to sell marijuana. Relying on 
People vs. 
Pajenado
,
[15]
 he invokes the 
rule that negative allegations need no proof except when such negative 
allegation is an essential element of an offense. Hence, in this case, 
where the 
lack of authority or license to sell marijuana is an essential element 
of the 
offense charged, the failure of the prosecution to prove this negative 
allegation entitles him to an acquittal.


We affirm the conviction of appellant.




The court 
a quo
 did not err in according 
weight and credence to the 
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. Their testimonies on how the 
buy-bust 
operation was conducted are free from contradiction or fabrication and 
find 
corroboration in irrefragable pieces of 
evidence.


In contrast, the version of appellant that three (3) men 
entered their house 
without any search warrant and that he was mauled when he refused to 
give them 
P5,000.00 is far from persuasive. He was not able to show any evil 
motive on the 
part of the prosecution witnesses to plant evidence against him, extort 
money 
from him, or testify falsely against him. His testimony is wanting and 
uncorroborated. Not even his wife and his two (2) children came forward 
to 
corroborate his testimony. The defense of frame-up in drug cases is easy
 to 
concoct and to be believed, must be supported by strong and convincing 
evidence. 
Appellant failed to discharge this burden of proof.


Appellantâs submission that it is incredible to engage in open 
selling of 
marijuana to strangers is rejected. As correctly observed by the 
prosecution, 
over time, drug pushers have become increasingly daring and openly 
defiant of 
the law,
[16]
 
especially where law 
enforcement is weak and feeble.


Appellant likewise faults the prosecution for not presenting 
the informant. 
The presentation of the informant is not per se necessary. There is no 
need to 
present him if the sale of prohibited drug has been adequately proved by
 the 
prosecution witnesses. If the elements of the offense have been proved, 
the 
informantâs testimony would be merely corroborative and 
cumulative.
[17]
 
His non-presentation would not create a 
hiatus in the evidence for the prosecution.


We reiterate the case law that material to a prosecution for 
illegal sale of 
dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took 
place, 
coupled with the presentation in court of the 
corpus 
delicti
 as 
evidence.
[18]
 In 
the case at bar, all 
these elements were proven. First, there was meeting of the minds 
between the 
buyer and the seller. PO2 Torres, the poseur-buyer, was willing to buy 
marijuana 
from appellant at P2,000.00 per kilo. Second, there was consideration 
for the 
sale, the parties having agreed upon the amount of P2,000.00. Third, 
there was 
delivery of one (1) kilo of dried marijuana leaves, the subject of the 
sale.


We also find no merit in the second assignment of error of the 
appellant. The 
doctrine in Pajenado has been modified in the case of 
People 
v. de los 
Reyes.
[19]
 In 
de los Reyes
, 
we held that the Dangerous Drugs Act applies generally to all persons 
and 
proscribes the sale of dangerous drugs by any person and no person is 
presumed 
authorized to sell such drugs. It is the accused, claiming the benefit 
of the 
exemption, who must prove that he falls under the protective mantle of 
the 
exemption.




In 
People v. Manalo
,
[20]
 we 
explained the rationale for the modification of the rule, 
thus:


âThe general rule is that if a criminal charge is predicated on
 a negative 
allegation, or a negative averment is an essential element of a crime, 
the 
prosecution has the burden to prove the charge. However, this rule 
admits of 
exceptions. Where the negative of an issue does not permit of direct 
proof, or 
where the facts are more immediately within the knowledge of the 
accused, the 

onus probandi
 rests upon him.
 Stated 
otherwise, it is not incumbent 
on the prosecution to adduce positive evidence to support a negative 
averment 
the truth of which is fairly indicated by established circumstances and 
which, 
if untrue, could readily be disproved by the production of documents or 
other 
evidence within the defendantâs knowledge or control. 
For 
example, where a 
charge is made that a defendant carried on a certain business without a 
license 
(as in the case at bar where the accused is charged with the sale of a 
regulated 
drug without authority), the fact that he has a license is a matter 
which is 
peculiarly within his knowledge and he must establish the fact or suffer
 
conviction (29 Am. Jur., 2d 184). Even in the case of Pajenado, this 
Court 
categorically ruled that 
although the prosecution has the 
burden of proving 
a negative averment which is an essential element of a crime, the 
prosecution, 
in view of the difficulty of proving a negative allegation, âneed only 
establish 
a prima facie case from the best evidence obtainable.
 (Supra,
 at p.817) x x 
x â
[21]




In the case at bar, it is clear that appellant had no authority
 or license to 
sell marijuana leaves. He was caught selling the prohibited drug in 
front of his 
house. He himself delivered the drug to the poseur-buyer and accepted 
the 
buy-bust money. He did not protest his arrest on the ground that he has 
authority to sell the drug. Until now, he has not produced any authority
 by way 
of defense.


Finally, we hold that the trial court correctly imposed the 
penalty of 

reclusion perpetua
. Under Sec. 20 of R.A. No. 6425,
 as amended by R.A. 
No. 7659, if the dangerous drug involved is 750 grams or more of indian 
hemp or 
marijuana, the penalty to be imposed shall be 
reclusion 
perpetua
 to 
death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P1,000,000.00. In this 
case, the 
brick of marijuana weighs over 750 grams. Hence, the penalty of 

reclusion 
perpetua
 and payment of a fine of P1,000,000.00 is within the
 ambit of the 
law.


WHEREFORE, 
premises considered, 
the appealed decision is 
AFFIRMED 
in toto
. Costs against 
accused-appellant.


SO ORDERED.
