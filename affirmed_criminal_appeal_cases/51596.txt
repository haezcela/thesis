VITUG, J.:


It is a sad but true reality that crime and poverty would often 
be the pernicious pair that curse society. Here, a lowly fishball vendor and a 
helpful brother to a needy sister, might have well been driven by dire necessity 
to kill and rob another. While the dispensation of justice must be tempered with 
mercy especially in favor of a poverty-stricken fellow being likely pushed to 
the edge by the exigencies of survival, the law, nevertheless, cannot turn a 
deaf ear to the victims of lawlessness.


Sometime in the early hours of 09 October 1997, approximately 
3:00 in the morning, while the city slept, some hardworking souls, like Salvador 
Sameran, a taxi driver, was plying the EDSA thoroughfare in search of 
passengers. Sameran had just come from Makati and was driving northwards, 
towards Cubao, when he saw a taxicab curiously parked at a junction in 
Mandaluyong City and Reliance Street. The left front door of the vehicle was 
ajar and a man was standing and leaning towards the driver's seat. The man 
placed something in his waist and then in his pocket. His interest pricked, 
Sameran blew his horn at the stalled vehicle, whereupon, the man, apparently not 
expecting the interruption, suddenly looked to his direction, affording Sameran 
a full view of his face. The man abruptly ran through a nearby overpass and 
crossed the wide stretch of EDSA towards Polymedic Hospital located at the other 
side of the avenue. Looking up, Sameran saw at the overpass two more persons 
looking at the whole incident from their high perch, and they, too, scampered. 
Sensing trouble, Sameran parked his taxicab some eight meters away from the 
stalled vehicle. Seconds later, he saw its driver alight and fall to the ground. 
Upon coming closer, Sameran saw that the felled driver was drenched in blood. He 
immediately rushed to the latter's succor, half-carrying and half-dragging him 
by the armpits towards his car. The good samaritan was unfortunately too late. 
On the cold and hard EDSA pavement, the unidentified driver, whom Sameran later 
learned to be Elpidio Ventura, a husband and father to five young children, 
breathed his last. Injured with four fatal wounds, Elpidio Ventura was later 
found to be divested of his day's earnings, including a $100 bill, which, his 
widow later recounted, he kept in his wallet as a memento of his previous 
employment in Saudi Arabia. 


Meanwhile, just at about the time the above events were 
transpiring, Abraham Baba, a security guard of the Eastgate Center, located at 
the other end of the EDSA overpass, was shrugging off the temptation of slumber, 
when, suddenly, a man jumped from the overpass into the guardhouse, jolting him 
awake. He told the person that he had no right to enter the compound and the man 
replied that he was just passing by. But a closer look at this mysterious 
character revealed to Baba that this was no ordinary trespasser. The man's white 
T-shirt was bloodied. A brief frisk yielded an 11-inch knife, which, when 
removed from its scabbard, was seen to be stained with fresh blood. After 
cuffing the intruder, Baba called the authorities. At the Mandaluyong police 
station, the suspect revealed his name to be Victor Caliwan y Prongo. 


Following further investigation, an information for robbery 
with homicide against Victor Caliwan was filed. It read: 


"
I N F O R M A T I O N




"The undersigned 3rd Assistant City Prosecutor accuses VICTOR 
CALIWAN y PRONGON of the crime of ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE, committed in the manner 
herein narrated, as follows: 




"That on or about the 9th day of October, 1997, in the City of 
Mandaluyong, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, 
the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together with unidentified 
persons, whose true identities and present whereabouts are still unknown and 
mutually helping and aiding one another, armed with a kitchen knife, with intent 
to gain and by means of force, violence and intimidation employed upon the 
person of one ELPIDIO VENTURA y FELIZARDO, did, then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and divest said ELPIDIO VENTURA y 
FELIZARDO of his day's earnings in an undetermined amount while the latter was 
on board his taxi; that by reason or on occasion of said robbery, the said 
accused, with intent to kill, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously attack, assault and stab with a kitchen knife ELPIDIO VENTURA y 
FELIZARDO, thereby inflicting upon the latter stab wounds which directly caused 
his death.


"CONTRARY TO LAW."
[1]




When arraigned, the accused pled "not guilty" to the 
charge.


In court, Victor Caliwan had a different story to tell. A 
fishball vendor for six years, he worked from Mondays to Saturdays. The day 
before the fateful incident, on 08 October 1997, at 7:00 in the evening, after 
taking a usual rest at his employer's residence following a full day of plying 
the streets, Victor Caliwan was on his way to Milagros Cordero, a sister 
residing at a squatters' area in Malabon to provide, as before, some financial 
assistance to Milagros who had just given birth. Arriving in Malabon at 9:00 in 
the evening, Caliwan promptly handed his sister Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00) and 
three kilos of rice. After an exchange of pleasantries, Caliwan went to sleep, 
but not before requesting Milagros to wake him up at 3:00 in the early morning 
to be on time in accompanying his employer to Divisoria. By 3:00 in the morning 
of 09 October 1997, Victor Caliwan was on board a Baclaran-bound bus. Two hours 
later, at 5:00 in the morning, he alighted at Boni Pinatubo in Mandaluyong and 
was walking directly towards Sierra Madre Street when a guard stationed in front 
of the Eastgate Center compound approached him and poked his gun at him. The 
security guard took him inside the compound where he and two other companions 
tied and took turns in mauling him for thirty minutes before turning him over to 
the authorities. When shown the bloodied knife by the security guard, he denied 
owning it. 


Milagros Cordero also testified to corroborate the story of 
Caliwan being in their house at 9:00 p.m., bringing three kilos of rice and 
handing over to her Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00). 


The trial court did not give credence to the defense put up by 
Caliwan. The court pronounced him guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide; 

viz
: 




"WHEREFORE, for all the foregoing, this Court finds the accused 
VICTOR CALIWAN Y PRONGO GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of the crime of ROBBERY 
WITH HOMICIDE defined and penalized under paragraph I, Article 294 of the 
Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, and sentences him to 
suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua; to pay the heirs of the victim Elpidio 
Ventura the sum of P50,000.00 as death indemnity; the sum of P50,000.00 as moral 
and exemplary damages; the sum of P51,700.00 as actual or compensatory damages, 
and finally the sum of P1,500,000.00 as indemnity for the loss of the victim's 
earning capacity.


"With costs.


"SO ORDERED."
[2]




Victor Caliwan questions in this appeal the sufficiency of the 
evidence upon which he has been convicted.


Indeed, no testimony was given to show Victor Caliwan in the 
act of stabbing Elpidio Ventura and divesting him of his earnings. Neither 
Salvador Sameran nor Abraham Baba actually saw accused Victor Caliwan stab and 
then rob the defenseless Elpidio Ventura. The conviction, to stand, can only 
then be predicated on circumstantial evidence. In order to support a formidable 
conclusion of guilt, circumstantial evidence must point to a series of facts, 
which must form an unbroken chain of events associated with the fact in issue 
which, upon the application of the principle of cause and effect, would satisfy 
a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Circumstantial evidence can support 
a conviction but it is necessary that 1) there must be more than one 
circumstance, 2) facts on which the inference of guilt is derived must be 
proved, and, 3) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a 
conviction beyond reasonable doubt.
[3]
 
Circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, consistent with the 
hypothesis that the accused is guilty; and at the same time, inconsistent with 
the hypothesis that he is innocent; and with every other hypothesis except that 
of guilt.
[4]
 When these conditions are 
extant, circumstantial evidence can be as potent as direct testimony in 
connecting the accused with the commission of the offense.
[5]
 


The Court has taken a close look at the testimony of 
prosecution witnesses Salvador Sameran and Abraham Baba. Altogether, the 
circumstances testified to inevitably point to the guilt of accused-appellant to 
the exclusion of any other plausible possibility.

After five minutes the police arrived, Sir.




"Q 


When the police arrived, Mr. Witness, what did you do?




"A 


I turned him over together with the knife then I go at the police station, 
Sir."

Briefly, the foregoing testimony amply established that (a) Victor 
Caliwan was seen leaning over the stalled taxi whose driver had been stabbed; 
(b) Victor Caliwan scampered towards the opposite side of the road through the 
overpass upon the unexpected arrival of Salvador Sameran; (c) the opposite side 
of the road, at approximately the same time, Victor Caliwan was seen by security 
guard Abraham Baba jumping from the overpass to the premises of the Eastgate 
Center compound; (d) Caliwan was wearing a bloodied T-shirt when accosted; and 
(e) a brief frisk of Victor Caliwan revealed a bloodied knife.


Nothing has at all been shown to indicate any possible reason why Salvador 
Sameran and Abraham Baba would testify falsely against accused-appellant. The 
latter's denial and 
alibi
, both unconvincing, cannot prevail over the 
testimony of the two prosecution witnesses. Neither is there any cogent reason 
to overturn the trial court in its assessment on the credibility of the 
witnesses who have testified before it.


The crime of robbery with homicide is committed by any person guilty of 
robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person when, by 
reason or on occasion thereof, the crime of homicide shall have been committed. 
The offense is punishable by 
reclusion perpetua 
to death. Where there are 
neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstance proved, such as in this case, 
the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 is imposed.


The Court notes that the assailed decision has ordered the accused to pay the 
heirs of Elpidio Ventura the sum of P51,700.00 by way of actual damages. A 
perusal, however, of the evidence presented by the prosecution, particularly the 
receipts of the funeral expenses, shows that the actual expenditures amounted 
only to a total of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00). The actual damages to be 
awarded to the heirs of the deceased must accordingly be reduced to that amount. 
There being no legal and factual basis shown for the award of moral and 
exemplary damages, the grant will have to be deleted. 


WHEREFORE
, the appealed judgment is AFFIRMED with costs against 
appellant and the award of civil liabilities is MODIFIED by reducing the actual 
damages to be awarded to the heirs of Elpidio Ventura from P51,700.00 to 
P20,000.00 and deleting the P50,000.00 moral and exemplary damages. Costs 
against accused-appellant.


SO ORDERED.
