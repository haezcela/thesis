[1]
ACCUSED-APPELLANT. 
DECISION




CAGUIOA, J:


This  is an Appeal
[2]
  under Section 13(c), Rule 124 of the Rules of Court from the Decision
[3]
  dated November 29, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 08722, which affirmed the Joint Decision
[5]
 dated October 10, 2016 rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 270, Valenzuela City (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. 302-V-16 and 303-V-16 finding herein accused-appellant Jimmy Fulinara y Fabelania (Jimmy) guilty beyond  reasonable  doubt  of  violating  Sections  5  and  11,  Article  II  of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,
[5]
  otherwise known as the 
Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 200
2, as amended.
The Facts
Jimmy was charged with violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165, in two separate Informations, which read as follows:
Criminal Case No. 302-V-16 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs)
That on or about March 4, 2016 in No. 3065 Manggahan St., Karuhatan, Valenzuela City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without any authority of law, for and in consideration of two hundred pesos (Php 200.00), consisting of (2) pcs. of One Hundred [Peso] bill (100.00) with serial numbers LS950956 and RA163447, respectively, marked as (JC-6) and (JC-7) did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell to PO2  JULIUS R. CONGSON, who  posed  as  buyer,  a  zero  point  zero  six  (0.06)  gram  of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu) marked as A(JC-1) [with] date and signature, knowing the same to be dangerous drugs.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
[6]
Criminal Case No. 303-V-16 [Illegal Possession of Dangerous  Drugs]
That on or about March 4, 2016 in Valenzuela City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without
any authority of law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession and control one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing zero point zero six (0.06) gram of white crystalline substance verified as [M]ethamphetamine Hydrochloride marked as (JC-2) with date and signature, knowing the same to be dangerous drugs.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
[7]
Upon arraignment, Jimmy pleaded  not guilty to both charges.
[8]
Version of the Prosecution
The version of the prosecution, as summarized by the CA, is as follows:
On March 4, 2016, at around 3:00 p.m., PO2  Julius A. Congson ("PO2 Julius") and PO3  Socobos ("PO3  Socobos") were at the office of the Anti-Illegal Drugs, Special Operation Task Group ("SAID-SOTG"), Valenzuela City Police Station when their regular confidential informant ("RCI") arrived and informed them about the illegal drug activities of a certain alias "Boyet" in Manggahan Street, Karuhatan, Valenzuela. Boyet was later identified as Jimmy.
Upon informing their Unit Chief, PCI Ruba, about the information, they planned the buy-bust operation. PO2 Julius, duly coordinated with Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency ("PDEA") and prepared a Coordination Form  and  a  Pre-Operation Report. PO2 Julius  was  then assigned as the poseur-buyer since he was just transferred from another battalion, making his identity more unknown to the target.
When the team arrived at the place of Jimmy, he was identified by the RCI. While at the gate of the house of Jimmy, the RCI proceeded to call for Jimmy. Jimmy answered the call and PO2 Julius was told by the RCI that he was the target.
The  RCI then [told]  Jimmy  that the  poseur-buyer, PO2 Julius, would like to buy shabu worth Php 200.00. He used two (2) one hundred (100) peso bills, duly marked with PO2 Julius' initials. After giving the marked  money  to Jimmy, the  latter placed the  said money in  his left pocket. Thereafter, Jimmy took out a black coin purse from his right side pocket and pulled out one (1) plastic sachet containing shabu, which was handed over to PO2 Julius.
After  receiving  the  plastic  sachet,  PO2 Julius  made  the  preÂ­-arranged signal for arrest by lifting his cap and held the hand of Jimmy. The other operatives  later handcuffed Jimmy. PO2 Julius proceeded to frisk Jimmy and was able to recover from the latter's  right pocket the black coin purse, containing another plastic sachet of suspected shabu and two (2) aluminum foil strips. PO2 Julius also recovered from Jimmy the marked money.
As people around the closely built houses were starting to gather and cause a commotion, the buy[-]bust team was instructed by their lead operative to continue the inventory of the confiscated items at PCP-9. PO2 Julius testified that he had the sachet of shabu subject of sale in his right pocket  while he was holding the black coin purse containing the other sachet of suspected shabu.
In the police station, inventory was conducted in the presence of Kagawad Rommel Mercado ("Kagawad Rommel"). The  Department of Justice ("DOJ") Representative and Media Representative were also called to witness the inventory, but their numbers were busy. PO2 Julius duly marked the sachet of suspected shabu from his pocket as JC-1, the sachet of suspected shabu he recovered from the black coin purse as JC-2, the aluminum foils as JC-3 and JCV-5 and the coin purse itself as JC-4. PO2 Julius put all the evidence in a brown envelope and sealed it. Subsequently, PO2 Julius turned over the pieces of evidence to the investigator-on-case, [who], in turn, prepared the other pieces of evidence.
Meanwhile, PO3 Fortunato Candido ("PO3 Fortunato") prepared the following documents: Memorandum Request for the Conduct of Inventory, Request for Examination, Philippine National Police ("PNP") Arrest and Booking Sheet and the mug shot of Jimmy.
[9]
Version of the Defense
On the other hand, the defense's version, as summarized by the CA, is as follows:
Jimmy  denied  the  allegations against  him.  He testified  that on March 4, 2016, he was walking towards the pharmacy to buy Salbutamol since his son had an asthma attack. Jimmy noticed that an Innova car was following him. Suddenly, two (2) men alighted and slammed him to the wall. When Jimmy asked them if they were police officers, one of the men took out a gun and pointed the same at his stomach. Jimmy was brought inside the car and [the policemen] started to question him about a certain Sugar.  Jimmy  replied that  he [does]  not  know [Sugar]  because many people eat at his "lugawan".
One of the officers demanded Php 10,000.00 if he could not point to them a certain Sugar. Jimmy was brought to Total Gasoline Station in front of SM Valenzuela and boarded in another vehicle.
Jimmy only had Php 170.00 in his pocket when he was arrested. He would use the said amount to buy Salbutamol. The sachets of shabu recovered from Jimmy were not his. Jimmy saw the said sachets for the first time when he was brought to Block 9.
On the other hand, Rosalinda Lague ("Rosalinda")  testified that she  is the  live-in  partner of  Jimmy. It was  not  true  that  Jimmy  was involved in selling drugs. On March 4, 2016, Rosalinda instructed Jimmy to buy Salbutamol because their son was experiencing an asthma attack. Rosalinda wondered why it took Jimmy so long to buy the medicine. Rosalinda learned about the arrest of Jimmy through a niece. At the precinct, Rosalinda told the police officers that Jimmy was just tending to his "lugawan" and had never been involved in selling drugs.
[10]
Ruling of the RTC
In the assailed Joint Decision
[11]
 dated October 10,2016, the RTC ruled that all the elements of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs were established.
[12]
  Similarly, all the elements of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs were proven by the prosecution.
[13]
  It further ruled that the defense of Jimmy that the  evidence  against  him  was  merely planted  after  he  was  not  able  to produce the money that PO3 Julius R. Congson (PO3 Congson) demanded from him is without merit.
[14]
 The defenses of frame-up and extortion interposed by an accused are usually viewed with disfavor as they can easily be  concocted  and  are  common  and   standard  defense  ploys  in  most prosecution of violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act.
[15]
  It also held that the testimony of Jimmy's wife is self-serving.
[16]
The RTC further ruled that the fact that the marking of the recovered drugs was only done at the PCP-9 office and not immediately after their confiscation  does  not  in any way taint their  weight  as  evidence against Jimmy.
[17]
  It  held  that  the  prosecution  substantially  complied  with  the requirements under RA 9165 and sufficiently established the crucial links in the chain of custody. Thus, the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized shabu remained unimpaired.
[18]
The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads:
WHEREFORE
,  premises  considered, judgment  Is  hereby rendered as follows, to wit:
In Criminal Case No. 302-V-16 finding accused JIMMY FULINARA y  FABELENIA  GUILTY  beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Article II of RA  9165 and, this Court sentences him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a FINE of P500,000.00.
In Criminal Case No. 303-V-16, finding accused JIMMY FULINARA y  FABELENIA   GUILTY   beyond  reasonable  doubt  of violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 and, this Court sentences him to suffer imprisonment of 12 years and One (1) day to Twenty (20) years and a FINE of P300,000.00.
Pursuant  to Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, [his] preventive imprisonment shall be credited in full to his favor.
The subject sachets of shabu are hereby ordered confiscated and forfeited in favor of the government to be dealt with in accordance with law.
SO ORDERED.
[19]
Aggrieved, Jimmy appealed to the CA.
Ruling of the CA
In the Decision
[20]
  dated November 29, 2017, the CA affirmed Jimmy's conviction. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
DENIED
. The RTC Joint Decision dated October 10,2016 is 
AFFIRMED
 
in toto.
SO ORDERED
.
[21]
The CA ruled that all the elements of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs and  Illegal  Possession  of  Dangerous  Drugs  were  proven  by  the prosecution.
[22]
   It further ruled that the defenses of denial and frame-up, like alibi, are considered  weak defenses and have been invariably viewed by the courts with disfavor since they can just easily be concocted  but are difficult to prove.
[23]
  Lastly, it ruled that the prosecution was able to account for every link in the chain of custody of the plastic sachets of 
shabu 
from the time they were seized by the police officers from Jimmy up to the time that the same were turned  over  to the  RTC, thereby  establishing  the  
corpus  delicti
  and preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence.
[24]
Hence, the instant appeal.
Issue
Whether Jimmy's  guilt for violation of Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165 was proven beyond reasonable doubt.
The Court's Ruling
The appeal is meritorious. The accused is accordingly acquitted.
In cases involving  dangerous  drugs, the confiscated  drug constitutes the very 
corpus delicti
 of the offense
[25]
    and the fact of its existence is vital to sustain a judgment of conviction.
[26]
  It is essential, therefore, that the identity and integrity of the seized drug be established with moral certainty.
[27]
  Thus, in order to obviate any unnecessary doubt on its identity, the prosecution has to show an unbroken chain of custody over the same and account for each link in the chain of custody from the moment the drug is seized up to its presentation in court as evidence of the crime.
[28]
In this regard, Section 21,
[29]
  Article II of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640,  the  applicable  law  at  the  time  of  the  commission  of  the  alleged crimes, outlines the procedure which the police officers must strictly follow to preserve the integrity of the confiscated  drugs and/or  paraphernalia  used as evidence. The provision requires that: (1) the seized items be inventoried and photographed  
immediately  after seizure  or confiscation
;  and (2) the physical inventory and photographing must be done 
in the presence of (a) the accused  or his/her  representative  or counsel,  (b) an elected  public official, (c) a representative from the media or a representative from the National Prosecution Service
 (NPS) all of whom shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same and the seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within twenty-four (24) hours from confiscation for examination.
[30]
The phrase "immediately after seizure and confiscation" means that the physical inventory and photographing of the drugs were intended by the law to be made immediately after, or at the place of apprehension. It is only when  the same is  not  practicable  that  the  Implementing  Rules  and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 allow the inventory and photographing to be done as soon as the buy-bust team reaches the nearest police station or the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team.
[31]
  
In this connection, this also means that the two required witnesses should already be physically present at the time of the conduct of the inventory of the seized items which, again,  must  be immediately done at  the place of seizure and confiscation â 
a requirement that can easily be complied with by the buy-bust team considering that the buy-bust operation is, by its nature, a planned activity
. Verily, a buy-bust team normally has sufficient time to gather and bring with them the said witnesses.
The Court, however, has clarified that under varied field conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 may not always be possible;
[32]
  and, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21 of RA 9165 does not 
ipso facto
 render the seizure and custody over the items void and invalid. However, this is with the caveat that the prosecution still needs to satisfactorily prove that: (a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.
[33]
 It has been repeatedly emphasized by the Court that the prosecution has the positive duty to explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses.
[34]
 Without any justifiable explanation, which must be proven as a fact,
[35]
  the evidence of the 
corpus delicti
 is unreliable, and the acquittal of the accused should follow on the ground that his guilt has not been shown beyond reasonable doubt.
[36]
The  buy-bust  team  failed  to  comply
with  the  mandatory  requirements
under Section 21.
In the present case, the buy-bust team failed to strictly comply with the mandatory requirements under Section 21(1) of RA 9165.
First
, none of the two required witnesses  was present  at the time of arrest of the accused  and the seizure of the drugs. The  barangay  kagawad was merely "called-in" at the police station.  As testified  by PO2 Congson himself:
 
 
"Q 
 
 
After arriving at PCP-9 for the inventory, what did you do next?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 
We called for the barangay kagawad, Sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
Who is this Barangay Kagawad?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Barangay Kagawad Rommel Mercado, Sir.
[37]
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
It bears emphasis that the presence of the required witnesses at the time of the apprehension and inventory is mandatory, and that the law imposes the said requirement because their presence serves an essential purpose. In 
People v. Tomawis
,
[38]
  the Court elucidated on the purpose of the law in mandating the presence of the required witnesses as follows:
The presence of  the witnesses from the DOJ,  media, and from public elective office is necessary to protect against the possibility of planting, contamination, or loss of the seized drug.  Using the language of the Court in 
People v. Mendoza
,
[39]
  without the 
insulating presence
 of the representative from the media or the DOJ and any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the drugs, the evils of switching, "planting" or contamination of the evidence that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) again reared their ugly heads as to negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the subject sachet that were evidence of the 
corpus delicti
, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused.
The  presence of  the  three  witnesses must  be  secured  not  only during the inventory but more importantly  
at the time of the warrantless arrest
.  It is at this point in which the presence of the three witnesses is most needed, as it is their presence at the time of seizure and confiscation that would belie any doubt as to the source, identity, and Integrity of the seized drug.   If the buy-bust operation is legitimately conducted, the presence  of  the  insulating  witnesses  would  also  controvert  the  usual defense of frame-up as the witnesses would be able to testify that the buyÂ­ bust  operation  and  inventory  of  the  seized  drugs  were  done  in  their presence in accordance with Section 21 of RA 9165.
The practice of police operatives of not bringing to the intended place of arrest the three witnesses, when they could easily do so â and "calling them in" to the place of inventory to witness the inventory and photographing of the drugs only after the buy-bust operation has already been finished â does not achieve the purpose of the law in having these witnesses prevent or insulate against the planting of drugs.
To restate, the presence of the three witnesses at the time of seizure and confiscation of the drugs must be secured and complied with at the time of the warrantless arrest; such that they are required to be at or near the intended place of the arrest so that they can be ready to witness the inventory and photographing of the seized and confiscated drugs "immediately after seizure and confiscation".
[40]
  (Emphasis    and underscoring in the original)
Second
,  the police officers offered the flimsy excuse that an alleged commotion occurred as the reason why they decided to conduct the marking, inventory, and photography of the seized items at the police station instead of the place of arrest. The Court points out that PO2 Congson's account of the events that transpired was full of inconsistencies and is thus, hardly believable, 
viz
.:
 
 
Q
 
 
 
Why did you decide to proceed to PCP-9 instead of doing the inventory at the place of arrest?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 
Sir because a commotion broke out and people from the area started to approach us.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
 
Earlier, you said that you went in the area together with five other Police Officers and you will just arrest one person. Why is it that the other Police Officers were not able to isolate the place so you could conduct the inventory there?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
That is the decision of our team leader, SPO1 Estrella to proceed at PCP-9, Sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
What is that commotion about?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
Upon handcuffing the target, the people went near us, Your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
Without even telling, "Move away, we are doing an operation?"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
We did tell them, Your Honor but they did not move away.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
How many people were there?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
Around 10-15 persons, Your Honor.
[41]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x x 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
Earlier, you mentioned that there were no other people around?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
During the transaction, no other persons were there, Your Honor and it was only during the time when we were subduing alias Boyet and placing him in handcuffs when people started coming near us because alias Boyet was then shouting, Your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
Where do these people come from?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
From the house of alias Boyet and from nearby houses, Your Honor.
[42]
 
 
During  his cross-examination, PO2 Congson  admitted that there was no real compelling  reason for them to postpone the marking, inventory and photography of the seized items at the police station, 
viz
.:
 
 
Atty. Kuong: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
 
Since there is a wall facing the house of the accused, the persons who went near the area would only come either from the left or right direction of the house, correct?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 
Yes Sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
Despite of that, your four companions failed to cordon the area in order for you to mark the seized evidence in that area?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Not anymore, Sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
All five of you in the operation?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
We are six, Your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
Who are your companions?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
SPO1 Estrella, PO3 Vizconde, PO2 Sacobos, PO3 Candido, PO2 Cabusao and I, your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
All of you were armed?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
Yes, Your Honor.

Atty. Kuong:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
You said that a commotion occurred in such a way that you were able to subdue the accused, did I understand it correctly?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Yes Sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
How does he resist?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
He was trying to free himself from my grasp and he was shouting, Your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
Yun lang, hindi naman talagang nanlaban na nanutok, nagpupumiglas lang
?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
 
Yes, Your Honor.
[44]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
So there was no compelling reason for you not to be able to mark the evidence in the area?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
 
Basta po...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
Just answer me, is there any compelling reason for you not to be able to mark the seized evidence in the place of seizure and arrest?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
Yung lang pong pag-lapit ng mga tao at ...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
Is that a compelling reason? As a Police Officer and there were six of you, all armed?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
Your Honor, we decided to...
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court:
 
 
 
 
Just answer me, you are the arresting and seizing officer.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Witness:
 
 
 
 
 
"Wala po siguro, Your Honor, pero iyon po ang desisyon ng team leader namin na pumunta na po kami sa presinto para mag-conduct ng inventory."
[45]
 
 
 
It bears stressing that the prosecution has the burden of (1) proving their compliance with Section 21, RA 9165, and (2) providing a sufficient explanation in case of non-compliance. As the Court 
en banc
 unanimously held in the recent case of 
People v. Romy Lim
:
[46]
It must  be  
alleged
  
and  
proved
  
that  the  presence of  the  three witnesses to the physical inventory and photograph of the illegal drug seize4 was not obtained due to reason/s such as:
(1) 
their  attendance was impossible because  the place of arrest was  a  remote area;
 (2)
 their   safety   during the inventory and  photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action  of the accused  or any person/s acting  for and  in his/her behalf; 
(3) 
the  elected  official  themselves were  involved   in  the punishable acts  sought to  be  apprehended
; (4) 
earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and  an  elected  public  official within  the period  required under Article  125 of the  Revised  Penal Code   prove futile   through  no  fault of  the  arresting officers,   who face the   threat  of  being   charged  with arbitrary detention; or
 (5)
 time constraints and  urgency of the  anti-drug operations, which  often  rely  on tips  of confidential assets,  prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the  presence of  the  required  witnesses even before the offenders   could escape.
[47]
   (Underscoring supplied)
In the present case, the police officers' excuse for postponing the inventory, marking, and photography of the seized items is weak and unbelievable.
Based on PO2 Congson's own account, the commotion only involved a group of 10 persons, who were five meters away from the buy-bust team.
[48]
  Also, although the accused initially resisted, they were immediately able to subdue him by handcuffing him. It is thus highly questionable as to why the buy-bust team of six members, five of whom were armed, decided to vacate the place of arrest and proceed to the police station. 
Moreover, the Court also points out  that  PO2   Congson  expressly admitted himself  that  there was  really no  compelling  reason for them to transfer to the police station and  that  they did it merely because  they were instructed by their team leader to do so.
The saving clause does not apply to 
this case.
As earlier stated, following the IRR of RA 9165, the courts may allow a deviation  from the mandatory  requirements  of Section  21 in exceptional cases,  where  the  following  requisites  are  present:  
(1)  the  existence of justifiable grounds   to   allow departure  from the rule on strict compliance; and  (2) the integrity and  the evidentiary value  of the seized items are properly  preserved  by  the  apprehending  team
.
[49]
 If  these elements are present, the seizure and custody of the confiscated  drugs shall not be rendered void and invalid regardless of the non-compliance with the mandatory  requirements of  Section  21.  In  this  regard,  it has also been emphasized that the State bears the burden of proving the justifiable cause.
[50]
  Thus,  for  the  said  saving  clause  to  apply,  the prosecution must first recognize the lapse or lapses on the part of the buy-bust team and justify or explain the same.
[51]
Breaches of the procedure outlined in Section 21 committed by the police officers, left unacknowledged and unexplained by the State, militate against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt against the accused as the integrity and evidentiary  value of the 
corpus delicti
 would have been compromised.
[52]
 As the Court explained in 
People v. Reyes:
[53]
Under the last paragraph of Section 21(a), Article II of the IRR of R.A. No. 9165, a saving mechanism has been provided to ensure that not every case of non-compliance with the procedures for the preservation of the chain of custody will irretrievably prejudice the Prosecution's case against the accused.  
To warrant  the application of this saving mechanism, however,  the Prosecution   must  recognize  the  lapse  or lapses, and  justify or explain  them. Such  justification  or explanation would be the basis for applying the  saving  mechanism
.   Yet,  the Prosecution did not concede such lapses, and did not even tender any token  justification  or explanation  for  them. 
The  failure to  justify  or explain  underscored the doubt and suspicion about  the integrity  of the evidence  of the  
corpus delicti
.
 With the chain of custody having been compromised, the accused deserves acquittal. x x x
[54]
  (Emphasis supplied)
In the  present  case, as admitted  by PO2  Congson, the conduct  of the marking, inventory, and  photography was not done in the presence of a representative of the NPS or a media representative-it was only done before a Barangay Kagawad
.
[55]
  Neither can it be shown from the respective testimonies of the arresting officers that reasonable efforts were exerted to contact  these representatives. PO2  Congson merely mentioned that they contacted the Barangay Kagawad only when they arrived at the police station. However, when they tried calling the other mandatory witnesses, they received no answer.
Clearly, the buy-bust team only contacted the required witnesses after the operation was conducted when they were already at the police station. It was a mere afterthought.   Moreover,   no other proof that the  NPS representative and media representative were contacted aside from the mere self-serving testimony of PO2  Congson.
In this connection, it has been repeatedly held by the Court that the practice of police operatives of not bringing to the intended place of arrest the required witnesses, when they could easily do so â and "calling them in" to the place of inventory to "witness" the inventory and photographing of the drugs only after the buy-bust operation has already been finished â does not achieve the purpose of the law in having these witnesses prevent or insulate against the planting of drugs.
[56]
Thus, the prosecution failed to present any tangible proof to justify the non-compliance with the strict requirements of RA 9165 as amended by RA 10640 and its implementing rules. Moreover, the records of the present case are bereft of evidence showing that the buy-bust team followed the outlined procedure despite its mandatory terms.
Hence, the integrity and evidentiary value of the 
corpus delicti
 have been compromised, thus necessitating the acquittal of Jimmy.
The presumption of innocence of the
 accused vis-a-vis the presumption of 
regularity  in  the performance of 
official duties.
The right of the accused to be presumed innocent until proven guilty is a constitutionally protected right.
[57]
  The burden lies with the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt by establishing each and every element of the crime  charged in the information as to warrant a finding of guilt for that crime or for any other crime necessarily included therein.
[58]
Here, reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty despite the lapses in the procedures undertaken by the buy-bust team is fundamentally unsound because the lapses themselves are affirmative proofs of irregularity.
[59]
  The presumption of regularity in the performance of duty cannot overcome  the stronger   presumption of innocence in favor of the accused.
[60]
  Otherwise, a mere rule of evidence will defeat the constitutionally enshrined right to be presumed innocent.
[61]
A review of the facts of the case negates the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties supposedly in favor of the arresting officers.  The procedural lapses committed by the apprehending team resulted in glaring gaps in the chain of custody thereby casting doubt on whether the dangerous drugs allegedly seized from Jimmy were the same drugs brought to the crime laboratory and eventually offered in court as evidence.
Corollary, the presumption of regularity cannot stand because of the buy-bust  team's   blatant  disregard  of  the  established  procedures  under Section 21 of RA 9165. The Court has ruled in 
People v. Zheng Bai Hui
[62]
 that it will not presume to set an a 
priori
 basis on what detailed acts police authorities might credibly undertake and carry out in their entrapment operations.  However, given the police operational procedures and the fact that buy-bust is a planned operation, it strains credulity why the buy-bust team could not have ensured the presence of the required witnesses pursuant to Section 21 or at the very least marked, photographed and inventoried the seized items according to the procedures in their own operations manual.
All told, the prosecution failed to prove the 
corpus delicti
 of the crimes of sale and possession of illegal drugs due to the multiple unexplained breaches of  procedure  committed  by  the  buy-bust  team in the seizure, custody, and handling of the seized drugs.  In other words, the prosecution was not able to overcome the presumption of innocence of Jimmy.
As a reminder,  the Court exhorts the prosecutors to diligently discharge their onus to prove compliance with the provisions of Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended, and its IRR, which is fundamental in preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the 
corpus delicti.
 
To the mind of the Court, the procedure outlined in Section 21 is straightforward and easy to  comply with
.  In  the  presentation of  evidence  to prove compliance therewith, the prosecutors are enjoined to recognize any deviation from the prescribed procedure and provide the explanation therefor as dictated by available evidence. Compliance with Section 21 being integral to every conviction:the appellate court, this Court included, is at liberty to review the records of the case to satisfy itself that the required proof has been adduced by  the  prosecution whether  the  accused  has  raised,  before the trial  or appellate court, any issue of non-compliance. If deviations are observed and no justifiable reasons are provided, the conviction must be overturned, and the innocence of the accused affirmed.
