Contrary to law.
[11]
When arraigned, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to all the charges. After termination of the pre-trial, trial on the merits ensued.
Around 8:00 p.m. on April 19, 2008, accused-appellant's twelve (12)-year-old son AAA was at home with his mother DDD and his four (4) siblings. AAA and his sister EEE were playing a game of "
dama
" when the heavily drunk accused-appellant arrived from a wedding celebration. He hurled words at EEE, such as "
Putang-ina mo, putang-ina n'yo isama n'yo na ang inyong ina sa Maynila at gawin n'yo ng pagerper.
"
[12]
 To avoid scolding, EEE and AAA ignored their father's rants. However, accused-appellant approached AAA, berated him, and boxed him which caused his mouth to bleed and loosened his teeth.
[13]
 DDD, who was doing laundry at that time, heard the commotion and rushed to the scene to pacify accused-appellant. EEE then instructed AAA to go to their other brother and report the incident to the police.
[14]
Prior to the incident, or around lunchtime in May 2003, accused-appellant asked his then ten (10)-year-old daughter BBB to accompany him to get firewood near the irrigation canal. On their way home, he ordered BBB to lie down on the banana leaf. Terrified, BBB obeyed him. He then took off his pants and removed BBB's lower garments. He went on top of her, told her to remain silent, and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. Afterwards, he instructed her to dress, and warned her not to tell anybody about the incident.
[15]
In the evening of March 18, 2008, fourteen (14)-year-old CCC was sleeping with her three (3)-year-old nephew when her drunk father entered the room. He lay beside her and touched her vagina. Overcame with fear, she was unable to shout for help from her brothers who were sleeping in another room. The following night, March 19, 2008, she asked her brother FFF to sleep with her and their nephew. However, accused-appellant was undeterred and repeated his reprehensible acts, and was even smiling. FFF witnessed the incident but was also helpless. The following morning, or on March 20,2008, CCC went to the house of a barangay councilor to report her father. Unfortunately, the said councilor failed to help her. She also called her mother DDD, urging her to return home, but the latter was unable to return since her brother was still under treatment at a mental hospital. That night, accused-appellant lay beside her and fondled her breasts and vagina. He also embraced her and placed his legs between her legs. He only left when she started to cry.
[16]
On the other hand, accused-appellant admitted that he and DDD have fourteen (14) children, including AAA, BBB, CCC, EEE and FFF. However, he fervently denied the accusations of his children. Unlike the portrayal of the prosecution, he was close to AAA, and took care of BBB and CCC when they were studying. It was only when CCC returned after five (5) years in Manila with her sister that she started the allegations against him. He claimed that it was EEE who filed the cases against him.
[17]
On October 29, 2013, the RTC found accused-appellant guilty on all the charges against him, the 
fallo
 of the Joint Decision reads:

 (Emphases, italics and underscores in the original)
The RTC held in Criminal Case Nos. CR-08-9135 and CR-08-9136 that AAA positively identified accused-appellant as the one who berated and boxed him on the face. His mother and his sister corroborated the same. The incident caused physical injury, as well as mental or emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation, on AAA's person.
[19]
 In Criminal Case No. CR-08-9180, BBB's categorical identification of the perpetrator and straightforward narration established that accused-appellant, through force, threat or intimidation, had carnal knowledge of his minor daughter. It is unthinkable for a daughter to accuse her own father, submit herself for examination of her most intimate parts, put her life to public scrutiny and expose herself, along with her family, to shame, pity or ridicule not just for a simple offense but for a crime so serious that could mean the death sentence to the very person to whom she owes her life, had she really not been aggrieved.
[20]
 It did not fault BBB for her failure to recall the exact date of the commission of the crime since the precise time is not an essential element of the crime. The relationship and the victim's minority were considered in the imposition of the penalty.
[21]
 As to Criminal Case Nos. CR-08-9183, CR-08-9184 and CR-08-9185, the prosecution proved all the elements of the offense. 
First
, the touching of the breasts and vagina, and embracing while placing his legs between CCC's legs to sexually arouse himself are lascivious conducts which accused-appellant committed against his daughter. 
Second
, he coerced his daughter to engage in the lascivious conduct. 
Third
, the Certificate of Live Birth clearly established that CCC was only fourteen (14) years old
[22]
 at the time of the offense. There was no proof that she was motivated to fabricate a story of sexual abuse against her own father. The RTC considered their relationship in imposing the maximum penalty provided. For his part, accused-appellant only offered denial without presenting any other evidence.
On appeal, the CA affirmed with modification the Joint Decision of the RTC. The decretal portion of the Decision reads:
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Joint Decision of the RTC in Criminal [Case Nos.] CR-08-9135, CR-08-9136, CR-08-9180, CR-08-9183, CR-08-9184 and CR-08-9185 are hereby 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION
. Consistent with 
People v. J[u]gueta
, where the penalty imposed is 
reclusion perpetua
, civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages should be [P]75,000.00 for each item and all monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this judgment.
SO ORDERED.
[23]
 (Emphases in the original; citation omitted)
The CA agreed with the RTC that BBB's narration of her ordeal in the hands of accused-appellant was straightforward and unequivocal. All the elements of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (
RPC
) were established. Actual force or intimidation need not be employed in incestuous rape of a minor, as in this case, because the moral and physical dominion of the father is sufficient to cow the victim to submit to his nefarious desires.
[24]
 The CA also agreed with the RTC that all the elements of sexual abuse were present. On three occasions, accused-appellant touched CCC's breasts and vagina. As her father, he exercised moral ascendancy over CCC to engage in his lewdness. CCC's testimony and her Birth Certificate established that she was below eighteen (18) years old at that time. The prosecution also proved, through the clear and convincing testimonies of AAA, his mother and his sister, that AAA suffered since childhood repeated verbal and physical abuse from accused-appellant, and that he dreaded being near his father. AAA suffered injury in the April 19, 2008 incident, as supported by their testimonies and a medical certificate.
The Court gave due course to accused-appellant's appeal from the November 28, 2016 Decision of the CA. It required the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desired. In its Manifestation and Motion
[25]
 dated November 6, 2017, the Office of the Solicitor General informed the Court that it adopts its Brief for the Plaintiff-Appellee dated April 6, 2015 for purpose of the appeal. Similarly, accused-appellant indicated that he adopts his Brief
[26]
 dated November 28, 2014 for the same adequately discussed all matters pertinent to his defense.
[27]
Accused-appellant claims that the absence of physical proof that he actually mauled AAA casts serious doubt to the prosecution's version of events. He insists that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses should not be considered due to their ill will against him. The Court should consider that BBB did not deny that she never repelled his supposed nefarious advances. The trial court relied heavily on the weakness of his defense and not on the strength of the prosecution's evidence.
The appeal is devoid of merit.
It is settled that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review, and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment, whether they are assigned or unassigned.
[28]
Guided by the foregoing, the Court deems it proper to modify accused-appellant's conviction of Rape, three (3) counts of Acts of Lasciviousness, in relation to R.A. No. 7610, to Qualified Rape, and three (3) counts of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610, as will be explained hereunder.
Article 266-A (1) (a), in relation to Article 266-B (1), of the RPC provides:
Article 266-A. 
Rape: When And How Committed
. â Rape is Committed:
1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;
x x x x
Article 266-B. 
Penalty
. â Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.
x x x x
The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:
1) When the 
victim is under eighteen (18) years of age
 and the 
offender is a parent
 ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim[.] (Emphasis supplied)
The elements of qualified rape are: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted)
[29]
 or is an ascendant, stepÂ­parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or is the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim. The gravamen of the crime of rape is carnal knowledge of a woman against her will.
[30]
In testifying before the trial court, BBB narrated in detail the crime committed, thus:

I was just lying down[,] Ma'am.
Q: 
Why did you not resist?
A:
Because I was afraid that he might beat or hurt me.
Q: 
 You said that you felt pain because of what your father did, that is physical pain, inside you Miss Witness what did you feel considering that it was your very own father who was deflowering you?
A:
Anger[,] Ma'am.
Q: 
Now how did that incident stop Miss Witness? 
A:
After he was successful in what he did[,] he voluntarily stopped and ordered me to dress up.

Q: 
So what did your father tell you as regards that incident when he had sexual intercourse with you[,] if any?
A:
He told me not to tell this to anybody.
[31]
 (Emphases supplied)
After a judicious review of the records of this case, the Court finds no cogent reason to deviate from the factual findings of the trial court, as affirmed by the CA, as there is no indication that it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case. Settled is the rule that the trial court's evaluation and conclusion on the credibility of witnesses in rape cases are generally accorded great weight and respect, and at times even finality, and that its findings are binding and conclusive on the appellate court, unless there is a clear showing that they were reached arbitrarily or it appears from the records that certain facts or circumstances of weight, substance or value were overlooked, misapprehended or misappreciated by the lower court and which, if properly considered, would alter the result of the case. Having seen and heard the witnesses themselves and observed their behavior and manner of testifying, the trial courts stand in a much better position to decide the question of credibility. Indeed, trial court judges are in the best position to assess whether the witness is telling a truth or a lie as they have the direct and singular opportunity to observe the facial expression, gesture and tone of voice of the witness while testifying.
[32]
The Court disagrees with accused-appellant's claim that the testimonies of the witnesses should be discarded because of harbored ill feelings. Family resentment, revenge or feuds have never swayed us from giving full credence to the testimony of a complainant for rape, especially a minor who remained steadfast and unyielding throughout the direct and cross-examination that she was sexually abused.
[33]
 No daughter, especially a minor like BBB in this case, would impute a serious crime of rape against her own biological father, unless she was impelled by a desire to vindicate her honor, aware as she is that her action or decision must necessarily subject herself and her family to the burden of trial and public humiliation, if the same were untrue.
[34]
 An incestuous sexual assault is a psycho-social deviance that inflicts a stigma, not only on the victim but also on the whole family.
[35]
We note that based on her testimony and her birth certificate
[36]
 presented, BBB was only ten (10) years old when the rape was committed against her in May 2003, since she was born on 
xxxxxxxxxxx
. However, it appears that the allegation in the Information and the decision of the trial court mentioned that she was sixteen (16) years old at that time. Accused-appellant cannot be convicted of statutory rape since BBB's correct age was not properly alleged in the Information. Otherwise, he would be deprived of his right to be informed of the charge lodged against him.
[37]
 Nevertheless, the prosecution still established beyond doubt that she was under eighteen (18) years old at the commission of the crime. From the foregoing, as well as the fact that BBB's minority and her relationship with accused-appellant were not only alleged in the Information but also proven during the trial, this Court finds it proper to upgrade his conviction in Criminal Case No. CR-08-9180 to Qualified Rape.
Anent the penalty imposed, the RTC is correct in imposing the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 without eligibility for parole. The penalty for qualified rape, if at all, the qualification of "without eligibility for parole," may be applied to qualify 
reclusion perpetua
 in order to 
emphasize
 that accused-appellant should have been sentenced to suffer the death penalty had it not been for R.A. No. 9346.
[38]
 In view of prevailing jurisprudence, the civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages awarded to BBB should be increased to P100,000.00 each, with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment.
[39]
Similarly, in Criminal Case Nos. CR-08-9183, CR-08-9184 and CR-08-9185, the Court does not find any reason to reverse the factual findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA. As the trial court observed, CCC was able to narrate in detail the lascivious acts done to her by her father, to wit:

The case of 
People v. Caoili
[41]
 is instructive on the proper designation of the offense in case lascivious conduct is committed, thus:
Accordingly, for the guidance of public prosecutors and the courts, the Court takes this opportunity to prescribe the following guidelines in designating or charging the proper offense in case lascivious conduct is committed under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, and in determining the imposable penalty:
1. The age of die victim is taken into consideration in designating or charging the offense, and in determining the imposable penalty.
2. If the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the nomenclature of the crime should be "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610." Pursuant to the second 
proviso
 in Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, the imposable penalty is 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period.
3. If the 
victim is exactly twelve (12) years of age, or more than twelve (12) but below eighteen (18) years of age
, or is eighteen (18) years old or older but is unable to fully take care of herself/himself or protect herself/himself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition, the crime should be designated as "
Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610
," and the imposable penalty is 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period to 
reclusion perpetua
.
[42]
 (Emphases supplied)
The evidence confirms that CCC was fourteen (14) years old at the commission of the offense. The acts of touching and fondling of CCC's breasts and touching of her vagina undeniably amounted to "lascivious conducts." Thus, there is a need to modify the nomenclature of the crime charged to "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610."
Since the perpetrator is CCC's father, and such alternative circumstance of relationship was alleged in the Information, and proven and even admitted by accused-appellant during trial, the same should be considered as an aggravating circumstance for the purpose of increasing the period of the imposable penalty. There being no mitigating circumstance to offset the said alternative aggravating circumstance, the penalty provided shall be imposed in its maximum period, 
i.e., reclusion perpetua
.
[43]
 This is in consonance with Section 31 (c) of R.A. No. 7610 which expressly provides that the penalty shall be imposed in its maximum period when the perpetrator is, 
inter alia
, the parent of the victim.
[44]
There is no need to qualify the sentence of 
reclusion perpetua
 with the phrase "without eligibility for parole," as held by the RTC and affirmed by the CA. This is pursuant to A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC
[45]
 in cases where the death penalty is not warranted, such as in the instant case, it being understood that convicted persons penalized with an indivisible penalty are not eligible for parole. Thus, accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 for each count of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of R. A. No. 7610. The award of civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages when the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 is imposed is P75,000.00 each.
[46]
 Therefore, the amount of damages awarded in Criminal Case Nos. CR-08-9183 and CR-08-9184 should be increased to P75,000.00 each, and the exemplary damages in Criminal Case No. CR-08-9185 to P75,000.00. Accused-appellant is ordered to pay a fine in the amount of P15,000.00, pursuant to Section 31 (f), Article XII of R.A. No. 7610. Also, the amount of damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) 
per annum
 from the finality of this Decision until said amounts are fully paid.
Lastly, this Court, likewise, sustains the ruling in Criminal Case Nos. CR-08-9135 and CR-08-9136 finding accused-appellant guilty of violations of Section 5 (a) and (i) of R.A. No. 9262. The trial court observed that the berating and mauling incident not only caused physical injury to AAA but also mental anguish and humiliation. By his own account, he was distressed and hurt by accused-appellant's acts, which started when he was young. Contrary to accused-appellant's claim, the prosecution presented AAA's medical certificate showing that he suffered hematoma on his right upper lip. This corroborated with the testimonies of the witnesses that AAA sustained physical injury from the incident. It has long been established that this Court is not a trier of facts.
[47]
 As discussed, factual findings of the RTC are conclusive and binding on this Court when affirmed by the CA.
As to the appropriate penalties, Section 6 of R.A. No. 9262 provides:
SECTION 6. 
Penalties
. â The crime of violence against women and their children, under Section 5 hereof shall be punished according to the following rules:
(a)
 Acts falling under Section 5(a) constituting attempted, frustrated or consummated parricide or murder or homicide shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of the Revised Penal Code.
If these acts resulted in mutilation, it shall be punishable in accordance with the Revised Penal Code; those constituting serious physical injuries shall have the penalty of prision mayor; those constituting less serious physical injuries shall be punished by prision correccional; and those constituting slight physical injuries shall be punished by arresto mayor.
x x x x
(f) 
Acts falling under Section 5(h) and Section 5(i) shall be punished by prision mayor.
x x x x
In addition to imprisonment
, the perpetrator shall (a) pay a fine in the amount of not less than One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) but not more than [T]hree hundred thousand pesos ([P]300,000.00); (b) undergo 
mandatory psychological counseling or psychiatric treatment
 and shall 
report compliance to the court
. (Emphases supplied)
The Court affirms the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. CR-08-9136. However, the Court deems it proper to modify the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. CR-08-9135. As aforementioned, R.A. No. 9262 imposes the penalty of 
prision mayor
 for violation of Section 5 (i) thereof. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term of the indeterminate penalty shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree, 
i.e., prision correccional
, or anywhere from six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances attending the commission of the crime, the maximum term shall be the medium period of the penalty provided by the law, which is eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years of 
prision mayor
.
[48]
 Therefore, accused-appellant should suffer the indeterminate penalty of six (6) months and one (1) day of 
prision correccional
, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
, as maximum.
This Court also notes that both the RTC and the CA failed to require accused-appellant to undergo psychological counseling or treatment. This is a penalty set by Section 6 of R.A. No. 9262 
in addition
 to imprisonment and fine. Thus, accused-appellant is required to submit himself to a mandatory psychological counselling or psychiatric treatment, and to report his compliance therewith to the court of origin.

CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION
CAGUIOA, J.:
I concur with the 
ponencia
 insofar as it affirms the guilt of the accusedÂ­-appellant ZZZ (accused-appellant) for the crimes he was charged with.
I disagree, however, that the nomenclature of the crimes for Criminal Cases Nos. CR-08-9183, CR-08-9184, and CR-08-9185 should be modified to "lascivious conduct under Section 5(b), Republic Act No. 7610," and the penalty increased to 
reclusion perpetua
 as a result of the modification.
I reiterate and maintain my position in 
People v. Tulagan
[2]
 that Republic Act No. (RA) 7610 and the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 8353, "have different spheres of application; they exist to complement each other such that there would be no gaps in our criminal laws. They were not meant to operate simultaneously in each and every case of sexual abuse committed against minors."
[3]
 Section 5(b) of RA 7610 applies only to the 
specific
 and 
limited instances
 where the child-victim is "exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse" (EPSOSA).
In other words, for an act to be considered under the purview of Section 5(b), RA 7610, so as to trigger the higher penalty provided therein, "the following essential elements need to be proved: (1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the said act is performed with a child 'exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse'; and (3) the child whether male or female, is below 18 years of age."
[4]
 Hence, it is not enough that the victim be under 18 years of age. The element of the victim being EPSOSA - 
a separate and distinct element
 - must first be both alleged and proved before a conviction under Section 5(b), RA 7610 may be reached.
Specifically, in order to impose the higher penalty provided in Section 5(b) as compared to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, it must be 
alleged
 and 
proved
 that the child - (1) for money, profit, or any other consideration or (2) due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group - indulges in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct.
[5]
In this case, the Informations only alleged that the victim was his 14-year-old daughter, but it did not allege that she was EPSOSA. Likewise, there was no proof or evidence presented during the trial that she indulged in lascivious conduct  either for a consideration, or due to the coercion  or influence of any adult.
Thus, while I agree that accused-appellant's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt, it is my view that his conviction in the aforementioned cases should only be for Acts of Lasciviousness, defined and punished under Article 266-A(2), in relation to Article 336 of the RPC - not Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), RA 7610. Accordingly, the penalty that ought to be imposed on him should be within the range of 
arresto mayor
 to 
prision correccional
 instead of the one imposed by the 
ponencia
 which is 
reclusion perpetua
.
Meanwhile, I fully concur with the 
ponencia
 as regards its affirmance of his conviction in Criminal Cases Nos. CR-08-9135, CR-08-9136, and CR-08-9180 for violations of Section 5(i) in relation to Section 6(f) of RA 9262, Section 5(a) in relation to Section 6(a) of RA 9262, and qualified rape, respectively.
[1]
 The real name of the victim, her personal circumstances and other information which tend to establish or compromise her identity, as well as those of her immediate family, or household members, shall not be disclosed to protect her privacy, and fictitious initials shall, instead, be used, in accordance with 
People v. Cabalquinto
 (533 Phil. 703 [2006]) and Amended Administrative Circular No. 83-2015 dated September 5, 2017.
