 Antecedents 
 
 
 Ramil, John Doe, and Peter Doe were charged with Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in an Information
[6]
 dated December 18, 2002 which states: 
  


 That on or about 11:30 in the evening of August 27, 2002 at 
Barangay Exciban, Labo, Camarines Norte, Philippines, and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with 
intent to kill, treachery and evident premeditation, conspiring, 
confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there 
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot, stab and hack with the use 
of firearm and bladed weapons one Mario Canaria inside his own dwelling 
place, thereby causing his instantaneous death, to the damage and 
prejudice of his heirs. 


 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[7]




 Ramil was arraigned on April 14, 2003 and pleaded not guilty.
[8]
 

 Plaintiff-appellee presented Marvin Canaria (Marvin), Angel Canaria, 
Jr. (Angel), Ana Marticio (Ana), and Dolores de Claro (Dolores) as its 
witnesses.
[9]
 The victim Mario Canaria (Mario) is the father of Marvin
[10]
 and the brother of Angel, Ana, and Dolores.
[11]

 Marvin and Angel testified that on August 27, 2002, at 11:30 p.m., 
Mario returned to his house at Barangay (Brgy.) Exciban, Labo, Camarines
 Norte together with Angel, Alberto Gaton (Alberto), and his second wife
 Lourdes Benitez from a drinking spree at Alberto's house. Mario and 
Alberto sat together on a bench while Angel sat on another seat. Marvin 
was at the 
tinabaw
, a place for sleeping made of bamboo sticks 
located near the roof of the house. Mario was tuning a guitar in 
preparation for serenading a certain Nena when three men arrived, one of
 which was Ramil. When one of them pointed a gun at Alberto, Ramil said "
[h]indi yan, yung isa
."
 The one holding the gun then shot Mario. The men ordered Mario, Angel, 
and Alberto to lie down facing the floor. The gas lamp in the house 
broke so one of the assailants took Alberto's flashlight and its light 
illuminated Ramil. Mario was shot again. Before leaving, the three men 
said that they should not follow them.
[12]
 
 After five minutes, Angel stood up and saw that Mario was already dead. Marvin went down from the 
tinabaw

 and also saw the dead body of his father. Mario had gunshot, hack, and 
stab wounds. Angel and Alberto went to Ana's house to inform her that 
Mario has died. Afterwards, they went to the nearest camp of the 
soldiers to report the incident; there, they were advised to go to Brgy.
 Captain Cesar Lopez (Brgy. Captain Lopez). Brgy. Captain Lopez 
instructed Brgy. Kagawads (Kgwd.) Victor Tenorio (Tenorio), Romulo 
Balmaceda (Balmaceda), and Alfredo Alim (Alim) to accompany them. Angel,
 Alberto, Brgy. Kgwd. Tenorio, Brgy. Kgwd. Balmaceda, and Brgy. Kgwd. 
Alim arrived at Mario's house at around 3:00 a.m. of August 28, 2002. 
Angel claimed that Ramil must have been motivated by the fact that Mario
 testified against him in a case for illegal logging. Notably, Ramil was
 also charged with the frustrated murder of Mario. Neither Angel nor 
Marvin told the barangay officials that Ramil accompanied the persons 
who shot Mario. However, Ana claimed that Marvin did disclose to the 
barangay officials that Ramil was the one who said "
[h]indi yan, yung isa
." Brgy. Kgwd. Tenorio prepared a report on the incident.
[13]
 

 Dr. Marcelito B. Abas conducted an autopsy on Mario's cadaver. He said 
that the cause of death was "shock hemorrhagic due to multiple stab, 
hacking, and gunshot wounds penetrating the lungs and the liver."
[14]
 
 Dolores averred that she spent P200,000.00 for each of the three cases regarding her brother,
[15]
 namely: (1) the instant case; (2) frustrated murder case against Ramil; and (3) illegal possession of firearm.
[16]

 She also spent P2,500.00 for transportation expenses from Tondo, Manila
 to Labo, Camarines Norte to attend court hearings, P400.00 for food for
 every court hearing from 2002 to 2006, P5,000.00 for the acceptance fee
 of the private prosecutor, and P1,500.00 for every court appearance of 
the private prosecutor from 2004 to 2006. Dolores did not present 
receipts for her claim of actual damages.
[17]
 

 For his defense, Ramil testified and also presented Brgy. Kgwd. Alim, 
Brgy. Kgwd. Tenorio, and Flordeliza Padilla (Flordeliza) as his 
witnesses. Ramil knew Mario because he previously resided in Brgy. 
Exciban. He decided to transfer to Brgy. Macogon, Labo, Camarines Norte 
so that his five children could be closer to their school. His new 
residence was more or less five meters away from his sister's house. 
Ramil claimed that on August 27, 2002, he had a drinking session with 
Seminiano Gerez, Armando Aguilar, Eddie Serdo, and Henry Rustique. They 
began their drinking spree at about 4:00 p.m. They bought some of their 
liquor from Flordeliza's store located 15 meters away from where Ramil 
would construct his house. At 10:00 p.m., Ramil slept at his sister's 
house. Flordeliza saw him sleeping when she went to urinate at 1:00 a.m.
 of August 28, 2002. She also said that the place where Ramil drank 
could be reached within 10 seconds from the boundary of Brgy. Exciban 
and Brgy. Macogon. Ramil woke up at 6:00 a.m. on August 28, 2002 and 
started constructing his house two hours later.
[18]
 

 Brgy. Kgwd. Alim testified that he was summoned by Brgy. Captain Lopez 
to accompany Angel and Alberto because Mario was killed. He also brought
 along Brgy. Kgwd. Tenorio and Brgy. Balmaceda. When they arrived at 
Mario's house, they asked Angel and Alberto if they recognized Mario's 
killer. They responded no because it was drizzling though Marvin said 
that Mario's killer was wearing fatigue pants. Brgy. Kwgd. Alim, Brgy. 
Kgwd. Tenorio, and Brgy. Kgwd. Balmaceda did not find any empty shell in
 Mario's house. Upon the request of Mario's family, they placed his 
cadaver on the bench.
[19]
 
 
Ruling of the Regional Trial Court


 On August 1, 2014, the RTC found Ramil guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and sentenced him to a penalty 
of imprisonment of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay the following 
amounts: (1) P75,000.00 as moral damages; (2) P75,000.00 as civil 
indemnity; and (3) P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.
[20]
 The RTC held that the testimonies of plaintiff-appellee's witnesses duly established that Ramil was the one who shouted "
[h]indi yan, yung isa
" or "
[h]indi yan, yung nasa likod
"
 in reference to Mario. Angel recognized Ramil's voice because they have
 been friends for two years while Marvin claimed that Ramil was his 
cousin. Based on jurisprudence, the sound of the voice of a person is an
 acceptable means of identification if it is established that the 
witness and the accused knew each other personally and for a close 
number of years. Further, Ramil's face was also seen when the light from
 Alberto's flashlight shone on it. PlaintiffÂ­ appellee's witnesses had 
no ill motive against Ramil.
[21]

 According to the RTC, Ramil's companions shot Mario. Aside from gunshot
 wounds, Mario also suffered from stab and hacking wounds which resulted
 in his death. Ramil conspired with the two unidentified men in hacking,
 stabbing, and shooting Mario. He induced his companions by identifying 
Mario. Treachery was present because Ramil and his coÂ­conspirators 
suddenly entered Mario's house and shot him. They attacked Mario 
deliberately and without warning in a swift and unexpected way that gave
 him no opportunity to resist or defend himself.
[22]
 

 The RTC did not give weight to Ramil's alibi because Brgy. Exciban and 
Brgy. Macogon are close to each other. Alibi can only prosper if it is 
shown that it was physically impossible for the accused to be present at
 the crime scene or its immediate vicinity at the time of its 
commission.
[23]
 
 Ramil filed his motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the RTC.
[24]
 Thereafter, he appealed to the CA. 
 
 
Ruling of the Court of Appeals
 
 
 On December 3, 2015, the CA issued a Resolution
[25]

 dismissing Ramil's appeal. This was due to his failure to file his 
appellant's brief within the reglementary period and his counsel's 
failure to inform the CA of his present and complete address despite 
being required to do so.
[26]
 Ramil filed a Very Urgent Motion for Reconsideration but on October 12, 2016, the CA resolved to deny it.
[27]

 The CA noted that in its Resolution dated May 11, 2015, Ramil's counsel
 was directed to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for 
failure to file the appellant's brief within the reglementary period. 
This was received at the given address of Ramil's counsel on June 4, 
2015 per the certification of the Postmaster. Ramil only filed his 
motion for reconsideration on January 4, 2016 or seven months beyond the
 expiration of the reglementary period that was counted from June 4, 
2015. The excuse given by Ramil's counsel of heavy workload did not 
justify his nonÂ­ observance of the rules on appeal. The CA held that the
 period to file pleadings is jurisdictional.
[28]
 
 After the CA denied his motion, Ramil appealed to this Court. Ramil filed a Supplemental Brief
[29]

 while plaintiff-appellee manifested that there was no brief that it may
 respond to because the CA did not admit Ramil's brief. In any case, 
there are no transactions or events that occurred since the CA 
promulgated its December 3, 2015 Resolution.
[30]
 

 Ramil argued that the RTC erred in ruling that he was duly identified 
as one of Mario's assailants and that his alibi was weak. His motion to 
fix bail was notably granted by the RTC and this was affirmed by the CA.
 Ramil pointed out that the judge who tried his case and had the 
opportunity to observe the deportment of the witnesses was not the same 
judge who rendered the judgment.
[31]

 He insisted that neither Angel nor Marvin was able to positively 
identify him. In contrast, Brgy. Kgwd. Tenorio and Brgy. Kgwd. Alim 
clearly testified that Angel and Marvin did not inform them that they 
saw Ramil. Plaintiff-appellee did not rebut their testimony or explain 
why Angel and Marvin failed to give such relevant information when they 
were asked who killed Mario.
[32]
 Ramil pointed out that Angel and Marvin could be motivated by the frustrated murder case filed by Mario against him.
[33]
 

 In addition, Ramil argues that it was not established that Angel and 
Marvin were familiar with his voice. Since bad blood existed between 
them, it can be assumed that they have not talked to each other for 
quite some time.
[34]
 
 Moreover, Ramil claims that his mere utterance of "
[h]indi yan, yung isa
"
 is not enough to establish that he conspired with the two unidentified 
men to kill Mario. The statement is too vague to be construed as a 
command to kill Mario. Ramil argued that based on jurisprudence, passive
 presence at the crime scene is insufficient to hold one liable for the 
commission of a crime. Conspiracy must be real and presumptive and must 
be proven by positive and convincing evidence.
[35]

 Similarly, treachery cannot be presumed and must be proven conclusively
 as the act itself. Ramil pointed out plaintiff-appellee's admission 
that the three assailants did not enter Mario's house. 
Plaintiff-appellee's witnesses were not even able to see the manner of 
attack or actual killing of Mario. Accordingly, Ramil prayed for his 
acquittal.
[36]
 
 
 
Issues
 
 
 The issues to be resolved in this case are: 
  


 I.	Whether the CA erred in dismissing Ramil's appeal; and
 
    II.	Whether Ramil is guilty of murder. 




 
 
 Ruling of the Court
 
 
 We partially grant the appeal. 

 Ramil undoubtedly failed to file his appellant's brief on time. As 
such, the CA was acting within its discretion in dismissing his appeal 
pursuant to Section 1 (e), Rule 50 of the Rules of Court.
[37]

 Nonetheless, We shall determine the merits of Ramil's appeal 
considering that his personal liberty is at stake. As We have held in 
People v. Ramos
,
[38]

 "procedural rules take a step back when it would subvert or frustrate 
the attainment of justice, especially when the life and liberty of the 
accused is at stake."
[39]
 

 The crime of murder is penalized under Article 248 of the RPC. Its 
elements are: (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed 
him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying 
circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC;
[40]
 and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.
[41]
 The RTC is correct that the elements of murder were proven in this case. 
First
, Mario was killed. 
Second
, Mario's death was due to the gunshot and stab wounds inflicted by Ramil's companions. 
Third
,
 the killing was attended by treachery. Article 14(16) of the RPC 
provides that "[t]here is treachery when the offender commits any of the
 crimes against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the 
execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its 
execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the 
offended party might make." As found by the RTC, Mario was unaware of 
the impending attack against him. He was simply tuning his guitar when 
his assailants suddenly arrived and attacked him. Mario was not armed 
and he had no opportunity to defend himself. 
 The RTC is likewise
 correct that Ramil's presence during the incident was duly proven. Both
 Marvin and Angel heard Ramil tell one of his companions "
[h]indi yan, yung isa
" before Mario was shot.
[42]
 Marvin is familiar with Ramil's voice because the latter is his cousin.
[43]

 To be more specific, his grandfather (on his mother's side) is the 
brother of Ramil's  father. Ramil's lot in Exciban was also beside the 
property of Marvin's family.
[44]
 As for Angel, he has been friends with Ramil for two years.
[45]
 Angel lives in the same barangay as Ramil.
[46]

 The Court has held that the sound of a person's voice is an acceptable 
means of identification where it is established that the witness and the
 accused knew each other personally and closely for a number of years.
[47]

 In this case, Marvin and Angel were able to show that they were 
sufficiently familiar with Ramil such that they could properly identify 
his voice.
 In addition to hearing Ramil's voice, Marvin and Angel claimed that they saw him. Marvin said in his 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
 dated September 3, 2002 that the light from the flashlight and the moon illuminated Ramil.
[48]
 He also testified that he saw Ramil by peeping in between the bamboo sticks of the 
tinabaw
.
[49]
 A flashlight taken from Alberto by one of the unidentified assailants shone on Ramil's face.
[50]

 Angel said during his testimony that he saw Ramil's face illuminated by
 a flashlight when he lifted his head while lying face down on the 
ground.
[51]
 
 
Nonetheless, Ramil should not be held liable as a principal of the crime
 of murder against Mario but only as an accomplice. On one hand, Article
 17 of the RPC provides that the following persons are considered 
principals: (1) those who take a direct part in the execution of the 
act; (2) those who directly force or induce others to commit it; and (3)
 those who cooperate in the commission of the offense by another act 
without which it would not have been accomplished. On the other hand, 
Article 18 of the RPC defines accomplices as those persons who, not 
being included in Article 17, cooperate in the execution of the offense 
by previous or simultaneous acts. The requisites for considering a 
person as an accomplice are: (1) that there be community of design; that
 is, knowing the criminal design of the principal by direct 
participation, he or she concurs with the latter in his purpose; (2) 
that he or she cooperates in the execution by previous or simultaneous 
act, with the intention of supplying material or moral aid in the 
execution of the crime in an efficacious way; and (3) that there be a 
relation between the acts done by the principal and those attributed to 
the person charged as accomplice.
[52]
 
 The Court distinguished accomplices from conspirators in 
People v. De Vera:
[53]




 Conspirators and accomplices have one thing in common: they know
 and agree with the criminal design. Conspirators, however, know the 
criminal intention because they themselves have decided upon such course
 of action. Accomplices come to know about it after the principals have 
reached the decision, and only then do they agree to cooperate in its 
execution. Conspirators decide that a crime should be committed; 
accomplices merely concur in it. Accomplices do not decide whether the 
crime should be committed; they merely assent to the plan and cooperate 
in its accomplishment. Conspirators are the authors of a crime; 
accomplices are merely their instruments who perform acts not essential 
to the perpetration of the offense.
[54]
 




 Based on the testimonies of Marvin and Angel, all Ramil did was 
identify Mario. There is no proof that the other assailants would not 
have been able to carry out their attack on Mario without Ramil's 
assistance. Further, Ramil did not direct his companions to shoot him or
 attack Mario himself. There is likewise no evidence that Ramil 
previously entered into an agreement with Mario's assailants to attack 
him. It is well settled that mere presence in the crime scene is not 
sufficient proof of conspiracy.
[55]

 All told, Ramil undoubtedly participated in the incident but his act of
 identifying Mario and standing by while his companions attacked the 
latter are not indispensable to the murder of Mario. There being no 
proof that he conspired with his companions, Ramil can only be held 
liable as an accomplice. 
 Pursuant to Article 52 of the RPC, the 
proper penalty for Ramil as an accomplice is the penalty next lower in 
degree than that prescribed for the consummated felony of murder, which 
is 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.
[56]
 The penalty next lower in degree is 
reclusion temporal
.
 Since there are no mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the penalty
 should be in its medium period. Applying Act No. 4103 or the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum period for the penalty of 
imprisonment of Ramil is eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 while the maximum period is fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
. 
 The Court held in 
People v. Jugueta
[57]
 that the following amounts must be paid to the heirs of the victim of the crime of murder punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
:
 (1) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) P75,000.00 as moral damages; (3)
 P75,000.00 as exemplary damages; and (4) P50,000.00 as temperate 
damages.
[58]
 As an accomplice, Ramil is only liable for 1/5 of the amounts granted to the heirs of Mario,
[59]

 to wit: (1) P15,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) P15,000.00 as moral 
damages; (3) P15,000.00 as exemplary damages; and (4) P10,000.00 as 
temperate damages. To clarify, Ramil cannot be held subsidiarily liable 
for the amount allotted to the principal if they die before the finality
 of this Decision because the principal's death would extinguish their 
civil liability.
[60]
 The amounts awarded shall be subject to a legal interest of six percent (6%) 
per annum
 from the finality of this Decision until their full payment. 
 
WHEREFORE
, the appeal is partially 
GRANTED
. The Resolutions dated December 3, 2015 and October 12, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 07084 are 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
 in that accused-appellant Ramil Antigua 
y
 Quila is found 
GUILTY
 as an accomplice in murder and is sentenced to a penalty of imprisonment of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 as minimum to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal 
as maximum. He is also 
ORDERED

 to pay the following to the heirs of the victim Mario Canaria: (1) 
P15,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) P15,000.00 as moral damages; (3) 
P15,000.00 as exemplary damages; and (4) P10,000.00 as temperate 
damages. The total monetary award is subject to an interest of six 
percent (6%) 
per annum
 from the finality of this Decision until its full satisfaction.
