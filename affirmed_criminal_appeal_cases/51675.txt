PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. PABLITO ILO Y ACAYEN @ âHAGAWAKâ, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

CALLEJO, SR., J.:


This is an appeal from the Decision
[1]

of Branch 63 of the Regional Trial Court of Camarines Sur, finding
appellant  Pablito Ilo guilty of Murder
for the death of his live-in partner, Virginia Oliva, sentencing him to suffer
the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and
condemning him to pay her heirs in the amount of 
P
50,000.00 and the
costs.


On November 28, 1997, an Information charging appellant with Murder
was filed with the trial court. The accusatory portion of said Information
reads as follows:


âThat on or about the 23
rd
 day of July, 1997, in
Barangay Old Caaluan, Tinambac, Camarines Sur, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to
kill, with treachery and use of superior strength, did then and there
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, strike with a big stone,
box, kick, one Virginia Oliva, his common-law partner, hitting the latter on
the head and on the different parts of her body, which caused her instantaneous
death, to her heirsâ damage and prejudice in such amount as shall be proven in
court.


ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.â
[2]


Upon arraignment on January 13, 1998, appellant, assisted by his
counsel 
de officio
, pleaded not
guilty.


At the trial, the prosecution presented three witnesses, namely:
Dr. Ursolino M. Primavera, Jr., Amadeo Bocaya and SPO1 Teresito Porteza, the
investigating and arresting officer.


Amadeo declared that on July 23, 1997, at about 10:00 p.m., he
and appellant had a drinking spree in the latterâs house.
[3]

Moments later, appellant and his live-in partner Virginia had a heated
argument.  Appellant kicked her several
times.
[4]
  Amadeo tried to pacify appellant but to no
avail.  Appellant rushed to the kitchen,
got hold of an old frying pan and struck Virginia with it.  She fell on the floor.  Amadeo tried to placate his friend but was
rebuffed anew.  Appellant got hold of a
stone used as tripod
[5]

in cooking and smashed Virginiaâs head with it.  Amadeo rushed to her aid and wiped off the blood oozing from her
head. Amadeo wanted to seek police assistance but was afraid to venture into
the neighborhood late at night.  He and
appellant continued their drinking spree until 4:00 a.m. when Amadeo left and
went home. 


Amadeo also testified that on two occasions during the trial,
appellant asked him not to testify for the prosecution lest Amadeo land in jail
for perjury but Amadeo opted to testify.  When asked by the public prosecutor to point to Virginiaâs assailant,
Amadeo pointed to the appellant.


Dr. Ursolino M. Primavera, Jr., the second witness for the
prosecution, declared 
inter alia
 that
at about 2:00 p.m. on July 24, 1997, appellant brought the hapless body of
Virginia to the Tinambac Medicare Community Hospital.  By then, she was already dead.  Her whole face was contused and swollen. Dr. Primavera performed an
autopsy on Virginiaâs cadaver and prepared a Necropsy Report,
[6]

the pertinent portion of which states:


âPOST MORTEM FINDINGS:


Skull fructure (
sic
),
closed with muscular contussion (
sic
), parietal area (R)


Skull fructure (
sic
)
closed forehead (L) with muscular contussion (
sic
)


Muscular contussion
(
sic
), lacerated wounds 2 cm parietal area (L)


Muscular contussion (
sic
), whole face


Blunish (
sic
) discoloration of orbital area bilateral


Lacerated wound eyebrow 1.5 cm (R)


Lacerated wound 2 cm (R) eye


Cause of Death:  Cardio-Respiratory Arrest


                        Hemorrhage â cerebralâ


Dr. Primavera opined that the fractures on Virginiaâs forehead
and parietal areas were caused by a solid object.


SPO1 Teresito Porteza of the Tinambac Police Station declared
that he conducted an investigation of the death of Virginia during which Amadeo
identified appellant as her assailant.  Appellant was arrested and jailed.  The policeman later proceeded to the house of appellant and conducted an
ocular inspection thereof.  The place
was topsy-turvy. The policemen noticed a broken frying pan and a stone inside
the house.  Porteza then entered in the
police blotter
[7]
 his
investigation report on the incident.


Appellant testified in his behalf.  He denied having killed the victim. He further declared that at
about 10:00 p.m. on July 23, 1997, he arrived home after a dayâs work of
fishing.  He averred that he caught
Amadeo on top of Virginia, while both were completely naked.  Appellant was flabbergasted.  He was about to hit Amadeo with a bolo but
the latter dashed out of the window and fled into the darkness of the
night.  Amadeo, however, returned and
picked-up four stones the size of a fist and hurled the same through the window
of the house of appellant. One of the stones hit Virginia. Appellant
instinctively covered his two young sleeping children with his body to protect
them.  Appellant dressed up Virginia
with a pair of panties and a shirt and brought her to the Medicare Community
Center.  He insisted that Virginia died
because Amadeo hit her with a stone.


On September 28, 1999, the trial court rendered a decision
finding the appellant guilty of Murder, the decretal portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the prosecution having proven
the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, accused Pablito Ilo 
y
 Acayen

alias âHagawakâ
 is hereby found guilty of the offense of Murder. He is ordered
to suffer the penalty of 
Reclusion Perpetua
 and to pay the heirs of Virginia
Ilo 
y
 Oliva the amount of 
P
50,000.00 for her death, and to pay the
costs.


SO ORDERED.â
[8]


The trial court gave credence and full probative weight to the
collective testimonies of the witnesses of the prosecution in tandem with the
physical violence and declared that the killing by appellant of the victim was
qualified by treachery.  The court,
likewise, disallowed abuse of superior strength as a separate modifying
circumstance since the same was necessarily included in treachery.


On appeal to the Court, appellant assigned in his brief a
solitary error of the court 
a quo
; thus:


âTHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT TREACHERY ATTENDED THE
KILLING OF THE VICTIM NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABSENCE OF COMPETENT AND SUFFICIENT
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE SAME.â
[9]


Appellant argues that the injuries inflicted by him on the victim
were spur-of-the-moment reflexes during a passionate loversâ quarrel, spawned
by jealousy. He avers that the prosecution failed to prove that the killing of
Virginia by the appellant was the product of a preconceived plan; a deliberate
act to do away with her, what with the presence of Amadeo. He further contends
that his actuations were triggered by the provocation emanating from the victim herself.  Hence, appellant
contends that he is guilty only of  homicide and not of murder.  On
the other hand, the trial court declared that based on the evidence on record,
appellant used means and methods in assaulting Virginia to insure her death
without any risk to himself arising from the defense which she might make.  Virginia was so emaciated and less than five
feet tall; she was at the mercy of appellant. The trial court concluded that
treachery qualified the killing and, hence, appellant is guilty of murder.


We do not agree with the trial court.


Treachery is not presumed.
[10]

The circumstances surrounding the murder must be proved as indubitably as the
crime itself.
[11]
 The
rationale of the principle was explained by the Court in 
People vs. Angel Rios
,
[12]

thus:


âIt is an ancient but revered doctrine that qualifying and
aggravating circumstance before being taken into consideration for the purpose
of increasing the degree of the penalty to be imposed must be proved with equal
certainty and clearness as that which establishes the commission of the act
charged as a criminal offense.  It is
not only the central fact of a killing that must be shown beyond reasonable
doubt; every qualifying and aggravating circumstance alleged to have been
present and to have attended such killing, must similarly be shown by the same
degree of proof.â
[13]


To constitute treachery, two conditions must be present, namely:
(1) the employment of means of execution that gives the person attacked no
opportunity to defend or to retaliate; and (2) the deliberate or conscious
adoption of the means of execution.  The
Court held that treachery cannot be appreciated if the assailant did not make
any preparation to kill the victim in such a manner as to insure the killing or
to make it impossible or difficult for the victim to defend herself.  The prosecution must prove that the killing
was premeditated or that the assailant chose a method or mode of attack
directly and especially to facilitate and insure the killing without danger to
himself.
[14]
 The essence
of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning done in a
swift and unexpected manner of execution affording the hapless, unarmed and
unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape.
[15]

There is no treachery where the attack is neither sudden nor preconceived and
deliberately adopted but just triggered by the sudden infuriation on the part
of the offender.
[16]
 To establish
treachery, the evidence must show that the offender made some preparation to
kill the victim in such a manner as to insure the execution of the crime or to
make it impossible or difficult for the person attacked to defend himself.
[17]

The mode of attack must be planned by the offender and must not spring from the
unexpected turn of events.
[18]

There is no treachery when the killing results from a verbal altercation
between the victim and the assailant such that the victim was forewarned of the
impending danger.
[19]


The prosecution failed to discharge its burden.  The only evidence of the prosecution to
prove treachery is that while appellant and Amadeo were having their drinking
spree, a heated argument ensued between appellant and Virginia.  Appellant boxed and kicked her several
times, hit her head with a frying pan from the kitchen, causing Virginia to
fall on the floor and struck her with a stone used as a tripod. There is no
indubitable showing that appellant planned the attack which was so sudden and
unexpected. The attack by appellant on the victim was preceded by a heated
argument between them. Indeed, Amadeo admitted that he knew of no cause for
appellant to inflict injuries on her. The prosecution failed to adduce evidence
as to the relative positions of appellant 
vis-Ã -vis

the victim. Taking into account the sequential continuity and rapidity of the
events resulting in the death of Virginia, it cannot be gainsaid that appellant
made preparations to kill Virginia and adopted a mode of attack as to make it impossible
or difficult for her to defend herself. That Virginia was prostrate on the
ground when she was hit on the head by appellant with a frying pan and a stone
does not constitute treachery. In 
People vs. Ricardo Embega, et al.
,
[20]

we held that:


âxxx [T]hat the final blows may have in truth been delivered under
conditions exhibiting some features of treachery, as in this case where the
victim was said to have dropped his knife and was thus attacked by accused-appellants
who were both armed, does not remedy the fact that the prosecution failed to
prove the existence of treachery at the onset of the attack.â
[21]


Neither did abuse of superior strength attend the killing of
Virginia Oliva. Abuse of superior strength depends upon the age, size and
strength of the parties. To take advantage of superior strength is to purposely
use excessive force out of proportion to the means of defense available to the
person attacked. In this case, the assault by appellant of the victim was a
product of impulsiveness or the heat of the moment in the course of an argument
between them. Hence, appellant could not have deliberately and purposely used
excessive force out of proportion to the means of defense available to the
victim.


In sum then, appellant is guilty only of homicide as defined in
Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code which offense is  punishable by 
reclusion temporal
.
[22]

Considering that no modifying circumstances attended the commission of the
felony, the minimum of the imposable penalty therefor, applying the
indeterminate sentence law, shall be taken from the full range of 
prision mayor
, which is one degree lower
than 
reclusion temporal
, and the
maximum period of the penalty shall be taken from the medium period of 
reclusion temporal
.


On the civil liabilities of appellant 
ex delicto
, the trial court awarded to the heirs of the deceased
the amount of 
P
50,000.00 as damages without specifying the nature of
such damages.  Moreover, the court failed
to award moral damages in favor of the heirs.


In keeping with prevailing jurisprudence, the heirs of the
deceased are entitled to the amount of  
P
50,000.00
by way of civil indemnity 
ex delicto

and  the amount of 
P
50,000.00 by
way of moral damages. While it may be true that the prosecution failed to
present any of the heirs of Virginia to prove that because of her death they
suffered mental anguish, anxiety and similar injury, however, the Court takes
judicial notice that as borne out by human nature and experience, a violent
death invariably and necessarily brings about emotional pain and anguish on the
part of the victimâs family, and that it is inherently human to suffer sorrow,
torment, pain and anger when a loved one becomes a victim of a violent death or
brutal killing; for such violent killing not only steals from the family of the
victim her precious life but also deprives them forever of the love, affection
and support.
[23]


IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING
, the decision appealed
from is 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATIONS
.  Appellant is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the felony
of homicide, defined and penalized by Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code and
there being no modifying circumstances in the commission of the crime, the
Court hereby metes on said appellant an indeterminate penalty of eight (8)
years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
prision
mayor
 in its medium period, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, ten (10)
months and twenty (20) days of 
reclusion
temporal
 in its medium period, as maximum. Appellant is hereby ordered to
pay to the heirs of Virginia Oliva, the amount of 
P
50,000.00 by way of
indemnity 
ex delicto
 and the amount
of 
P
50,000.00 by way of moral damages and to pay the costs.


SO ORDERED.
