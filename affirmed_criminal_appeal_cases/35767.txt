PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS GREGORIO TULOP @ âBOY TULOP,â SALVADOR BALDEVIANO, RENY MONDEJAR, JESSIE
PINATUBO, @ âBISAYA,â EDUARDO SENIA @ âERNING PULA,â AND ERNESTO TEJADA, ACCUSED,
GREGORIO TULOP @ âBOY TULOP,â APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


The credible and
positive testimony of a single witness may be a sufficient basis for
conviction.  For evidence  is assessed in terms of quality, not
necessarily of quantity.


The Case


The Court
applies this principle in resolving this appeal from the Decision
[1]
 dated February 22, 1996,
[2]
 promulgated by the Regional Trial
Court of Balanga, Bataan, Branch 3, convicting Gregorio Tulop and Salvador
Baldeviano of murder and sentencing each of them to 
reclusion perpetua
.


After conducting
a preliminary investigation, Second Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Angelito V.
Lumabas filed before the court 
a quo
 an Information dated February 16,
1994, charging the following with murder:  Gregorio Tulop @ âBoy Tulop,â Eduardo Senia @ âErning Pula,â Reny
Mondejar, Jessie Pinatubo @ âBisaya,â Salvador Baldeviano and Ernesto
Tejada.  The murder was allegedly
committed as follows:


âThat on or about July 5, 1992 at
nighttime purposely sought to better accomplish their criminal designs at Brgy.
Gen. Lim, Orion, Bataan, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the said accused, with intent to kill, conspiring,
confederating together and mutually aiding one another, with treachery and evident
premeditation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack,
assault and use personal violence upon Sesenando Sandoval, by then and there
stabbing him with bladed weapons on the different parts of his body, thereby
inflicting upon the said Sesenando Sandoval mortal injuries which were the
direct and immediate cause of his death thereafter, to the damage and prejudice
of the heirs of said victim.


CONTRARY TO LAW.â
[3]


Accused Eduardo
Senia, Reny Mondejar, Jessie Pinatubo and Ernesto Tejada eluded arrest and
remained at large.  Hence, the case
against them was archived, pursuant to Circular No. 7-A-92.  Only the two other accused, Salvador
Baldeviano and Gregorio Tulop, were arraigned.  With the assistance of their Counsel 
de Parte
 Joe Frank Zuniga,
both of them entered a plea of not guilty.  On May 11, 1994, Atty. Zuniga withdrew his appearance as counsel for
Accused Salvador Baldeviano and was replaced by Atty. Joey V. Saldana of the
Public Attorneyâs Office.


After trial on
the merits, the court 
a quo
 rendered the assailed Decision, the decretal
portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, the guilt of the
accused Gregorio Tulop and Salvador Baldeviano having been proved beyond
reasonable doubt, they are hereby sentenced to reclusion perpetua with all
accessory penalties provided by law, plus costs.


SO ORDERED.â
[4]


Appellant
Gregorio Tulop filed a notice of appeal, but Accused Baldeviano did not.
[5]
 A few months after posting the
Appellantâs Brief on March 31, 1997, Atty Zuniga, through a motion dated June
2, 1997, also withdrew as counsel for Appellant Tulop.


The Facts


Version of the Prosecution


The Appelleeâs
Brief presents these facts as viewed by the prosecution:
[6]


â1.
      
On
July 5, 1992, at around 7:30 in the evening, Sesenando Sandoval, a furniture
maker in Balanga, Bataan, arrived home from work.  His daughter, Rowena Sandoval, was at home taking care of her
newborn baby.  After resting, he planted
some banana suckers at the back of their house (pp. 18-20, TSN, January 18,
1995).


2.
       
At
around 10:30 in the evening, Rowena woke up Sesenando and asked him to get hot
water for her (pp. 20-21, TSN, 
supra)
.


3.
       
At
around 11:00 in the evening, Sesenando was still awake and standing beside the door
when suddenly appellant and his co-accused barged into the house and then
forcibly dragged Sesenando outside.  He
was taken to the back of the house where he was surrounded by the other
co-accused.  At that time, Rowena stood
by a window about 4 arms length from the place where the incident occurred (pp.
21-23, TSN, 
supra
, p. 4, TSN, 
supra)
.


4.
       
From
her location, Rowena saw appellant hack her father with a âpanlabraâ (big bolo
used to cut wood), while co-accused Salvador Baldeviano stabbed him with a fan
knife or balisong.  The 5 other
co-accused, who surrounded him were all armed.  They then took turns in hacking and stabbing him (pp. 4-6, TSN, 
supra)
.


5.
       
After
witnessing the killing of her father, Rowena went into shock and lost
consciousness.  When she recovered her
grandmother told her that her father was dead (pp. 6-7, TSN, 
supra)
.


6.
       
Dr.
Nicudemos Corpuz, rural health physician of Balanga, Bataan examined the body
of the victim on July 5, 1992 and issued a death certificate (Exh. A) with the
following findings:


âThe cause of death was
cardio-respiratory arrest with the multiple hacked wounds being the immediate
and antecedent cause.ââ


Version of the Defense


In his nine-page
Brief,  Appellant Tulop sets up alibi
and denial.  He curtly narrates the
facts in this way:


âOn the other
hand, the defense for Tulop presented three (3) witnesses, namely: the accused
himself, M/Sgt. Modesto Novero, and Zaldy Dizon.  These witnesses testified in corroboration, that it was
impossible for the accused Tulop to have committed the crime being imputed to
him because he was at Camp Aguinaldo from July 3 to 7, 1992 with Zaldy Dizon
staying at his aunt because the former was asking assistance from M/Sgt. Novero
so that he could go back to the military service.â
[7]


The testimonies
of the defense witnesses were summarized by the trial court as follows:


âDEFENSE
EVIDENCE


GREGORIO TULOP, 28 years old,
testified that on July 5, 1992, he was at Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City.  Sesenando Sandoval was the godfather of his
son.  He accompanied his friend Zaldy
Dizon who wanted to join the armed forces.  They left Brgy. Gen. Lim, Orion, Bataan on July 3, 1992, arrived at Camp
Aguinaldo on the same day and stayed there up to July 7, 1992.  Zaldy Dizon was to help in the canteen of M/Sgt.
Novero in the camp while the latter was working for his papers.  Tulop stayed with his aunt in Camp Aguinaldo
and stayed there for four days because he was asking the assistance of Master
Sgt. Novero so that he could go back to the service.  He was a former member of the Philippine Air Force.  His service was discontinued when he was
assigned at Cebu when his wife gave birth and he was not able to report for
duty and considered AWOL.  When he
returned on July 7, 1992, to Orion, Bataan, he learned that Sesenando Sandoval
was already dead.  Rowena Sandoval told
him that her father was taken away by unknown persons and brought at the back
of their house.  On January 25, 1994 some
policemen came to their house and invited him to the house of [the] Brgy. Captain
but instead was brought to the police headquarters at [the] Municipal Building
of Orion.  After about one hour,
Salvador Baldeviano and Rowena Sandoval, together with her husband arrived.  Then he was told he was being charged of
murder.  Thereafter, he was jailed.  When asked why Rowena Sandoval testified
against him, he said that Rowena Sandoval was still young when her parents
separated and were demanding from him P80,000.00 because they would buy [a]
motorcycle.  From July 7, 1992 up to
January 25, 1994, he used to stay at Gen. Lim, Orion Bataan but used to go to
Manila to visit his aunt and his brother and sister.  The visits lasted from two to three days (tsn. March 16, 1995, p.
10)


On cross-examination, he stated
that he did not have any previous misunderstanding with Sesenando or
Rowena.  He insisted that Rowena was
demanding P80,000.00 because of the murder charge even if she knew that on July
5, 1992, he was jobless.  But she knew
that he could get the amount from a Japanese brother-in-law.  Tulop admitted also that his application to
go back to the military was denied because he was dishonorably dismissed in
1991.


M/SGT. MODESTO NOVERO, 43 years
old, married and a resident of Camp Aguinaldo for twenty years.  He knew Gregorio Tulop as he was also a
soldier and had been his companion.  He
alleged that on July 3, 1992, in the afternoon, Tulop arrived with Zaldy
Dizon.  Tulop was seeking his help if he
could be reinstated in his job even if he was an AWOL, while Dizon [wanted] to
enlist as a soldier.  He told Tulop to
wait and he would do his best and advised Dizon to stay with him while waiting
to be enlisted.  Both Tulop and Dizon
stayed in his house from July 3, 1992.  Tulop left his house on July 7, 1992.  Tulop used to help in his canteen at the concessionaireâs area at Camp
Aguinaldo (tsn. May 16, 1995, p.5).  From July 3 to July 7, 1992, Tulop slept at 11:00 oâclock in the
evening.  Tulop did not leave on July 5,
1992, because he was waiting for the result of his reinstatement.  He was not able to reinstate Tulop as his
case was quite grave; but Dizon became a soldier.  Novero did not know the time when Tulop left on July 7, 1992, as
he was in his office.


On cross-examination, Novero
admitted that as a soldier he reported for work at 8:00 oâclock in the
morning.  He stays in his office until
11:00 or 12:00 in the morning.  He
reported for work daily and he did so on July 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.  He admitted that he was told by the superior
to whom he talked about the enlistment of Tulop that it was difficult and
hopeless but he [did] not remember these officers who told this to him on July
3, 4 and 5.


ZALDY DIZON, 21
years old, single, a soldier and resident of Gen. Lim, Orion, Bataan, testified
that Tulop helped him in applying to be enlisted in the military.  He said he arrived with Tulop, at Camp
Aguinaldo in the morning (tsn. August 17, 1995, p. 4).  Up to July 5, 1992, he was accompanied by
Tulop in the processing of his papers.  After that, Tulop like him helped in the canteen from 8:00 in the morning
until 10:00 in the evening.  Tulop left
on July 7, 1992.  He admitted on
direct-examination that he went out with Tulop to process his papers while on
cross-examination he said that from 7:00 in the morning up to the evening, he
was helping in the canteen (tsn. August 17, 1995, p. 13).  He also admitted he owe[d] Tulop a debt of
gratitude (tsn, idem. p. 15).â

The Issue


Appellant
interposes the present appeal with these allegations:


âI


The lower court erred in not
discrediting the lone testimony of the complainant.


II


The lower
court erred in convicting the herein accused Gregorio Tulop.â
[9]


Principally,
this appeal questions the trial courtâs assessment of the credibility of
witnesses.


The Courtâs Ruling


The appeal is
devoid of merit.


Credibility of Witnesses


This
Court has consistently accorded deference to the trial judgeâs assessment  of  the  witnesses  and  their  credibility,  since he had the opportunity to observe
firsthand their demeanor and deportment.
[10]
 âThis Court has none of
the advantages of the trial judgeâs position, relying as it does, only on the
cold records of the case and on the judgeâs discretion.  In the absence of showing that the factual
findings of the trial judge were reached arbitrarily or without sufficient
basis, these findings are to be received with respect by, and indeed are
binding on, this Court.â
[11]


We have
carefully examined the testimony of Rowena Sandoval, the lone eyewitness, and
have found no reason to disturb the conclusion of the trial court that her
testimony was straightforward, guileless and credible.  She testified:

[12]


In a candid and
convincing manner, Rowena Sandoval narrated how two of the accused held her
father,
[13]
 then forcibly dragged him out of
their house
[14]
 with the help of five others,
[15]
 and finally stabbed and hacked him
while he lay on the ground.  She was
able to witness the crime because the âmoon was bright at the time,â
[16]
 and she was looking out of a window
which was only four âarms lengthsâ away from where the assailants stabbed and
hacked her father.
[17]
 Likewise, she was able to identify
the appellant because he had been their neighbor since she was seven years old.
[18]


Rowenaâs testimony
regarding the injuries sustained by the victim was supported by the
medico-legal findings of Dr. Nicudemos Corpuz, who conducted the autopsy.  His testimony on the cause of death and the
injuries of the victim is reproduced below:


âQ.
   
In
this certificate of death, it is stated here the cause of death - cardio
respiratory arrest, immediate cause and antecedent cause, multiple hack
wound.  How did you arrive [at] this
cause of death?


A.
    
Because
of the multiplicity of the hacked wounds, since there [was] a quick loss of
blood thatâs why I arrived at that cause, cardio respiratory arrest due to
multiple hacked wounds.

I
forgot the number of hacked wounds.  I

according to you that wound he sustained on his face was the one mortal or
serious [sic] which caused his death?

Yes, sir.
[19]


That Rowena
Sandoval is a daughter of the victim does not 
ipso facto
 discredit her
testimony as biased.
[20]
 Family relationship does not by
itself render an eyewitnessâ testimony inadmissible or less credible or devoid
of probative value.
[21]
 On the contrary, Rowena Sandoval,
âbeing a blood relative of the deceased, would not just indiscriminately impute
the crime to anybody but would necessarily identify and seek the conviction of
the real culprit himself to obtain justice.â
[22]


So too, the
failure of Rowena Sandoval to reveal at once the identity of accused-appellants
as the perpetrators of the crime does not impair her credibility as a
witness.  It has been held that â[i]t is
not uncommon for a witness to a crime to show some reluctance about getting
involved in a criminal case, as in fact the natural tendency of most people not
to get involved is of judicial notice.â
[23]
 She stated that she reported the
matter a year-and-a-half late âout of fear because there was a threat on our
part, my two brothers and myself that they would kill us.â
[24]
 Specifically, she said that Accused
Salvador Baldeviano made this threat: 
âIsusunod ka naming patayin.â
[25]
 The situation of the witness must
be taken in the context of reality.  She
was but a 15-year-old child living in a barrio and threatened by her very
neighbors who were grown men, one of whom was a former soldier.  Her diffidence about the matter is therefore
understandable.


In his Brief,
appellant disparages the âlone and uncorroboratedâ testimony of the
complainant.  He had no reason to be
disconsolate.  We reiterate the
well-entrenched rule that âthe testimony of a lone eyewitness, if found
positive and credible by the trial court, is sufficient to support a conviction
especially when the testimony bears the earmarks of truth and sincerity and had
been delivered spontaneously, naturally and in a straightforward manner.â
[26]
 It has been held that â[w]itnesses
are to be weighed, not numbered[;] hence, it is not at all uncommon to reach a
conclusion of guilt on the basis of the testimony of a single witness.  For although the number of witnesses may be
considered a factor in the appreciation of evidence, preponderance is not
necessarily with the greatest number and conviction can still be had on the
basis of the credible and positive testimony of a single witness.â
[27]
 Corroborative evidence is deemed
necessary âonly when there are reasons to warrant the suspicion that the
witness falsified the truth or that his observation had been inaccurate.â
[28]
 In the case before us, the trial
court found the testimony of Rowena Sandoval convincing and trustworthy.  We find no reason to disturb such finding.


Appellant also
assails the credibility of Rowena on the ground of an alleged inconsistency in
her testimony.  Although Rowena claimed
that the accused threatened her and her two brothers, her recollection of the
wording of the threat demonstrated that the same  was directed at her alone.
[29]
 This contention scarcely deserves
consideration.  The alleged
inconsistency does not question the eyewitness account of Rowena that appellant
was one of the assailants of her father; it only challenges her recollection of
the subsequent attempt of the accused to prevent her from testifying.  The Court has held that inconsistencies in
the testimony of a witness with respect to minor details and collateral matters
do not affect the substance, veracity or weight of his or her declarations.
[30]


Appellant
further faults the prosecution for not presenting Rowenaâs sworn statement
dated January 24, 1994, and for not calling to the witness stand the âofficer
who investigated the case.â
[31]
 He argues that the failure of the
prosecution to do so engenders the presumption that these pieces of evidence were
not favorable to the prosecution.  This
contention is untenable.  The adverse
presumption does not apply where the evidence allegedly suppressed by the
prosecution was also available to the defense.
[32]
 In this case, appellant himself
showed the said sworn statement to Rowena during the trial, and he had a choice
to present the same as his own evidence.  Furthermore, appellant himself could have compelled the presentation of
the investigating officer, but he failed to show why he was unable to do so. 


Alibi


Accused-appellant
denies the charge and invokes alibi as his defense.  This Court reiterates that the defense of alibi, as a rule, is
considered with suspicion and is always received with caution, not only because
it is inherently weak and unreliable but also because it can be easily
fabricated and concocted.
[33]
 For such defense to prosper, âit
must be convincing enough to preclude any doubt on the physical impossibility
of the presence of the accused at the 
locus criminis
 or its immediate
vicinity at the time of the incident.â
[34]


Appellant
contended that he was in Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City, when the crime was
committed in Bataan.  This appeared to
be corroborated  by M/Sgt Novero, who
testified that appellant stayed in the formerâs house in Quezon City from July
3 to July 6, 1992 and therefore could not have been at the scene of the crime
at the time.  The trial court did not
give credence to Noveroâs testimony, and we agree with the trial court.  Novero merely assumed that appellant was
working in his canteen in Quezon City, but he had no personal knowledge
thereof, because he himself was in his office at the time.  


Novero added
that he allowed Tulop to stay in his house for three more days thereafter in
order to enable the latter to await the result of his application for
reinstatement to the military service.  As observed by the trial court, this âsmacks of prevarication.  Tulop was an AWOL, dishonorably discharged,
and Novero, as a military man of some two decades, would have known of the
improbability of Tulopâs reinstatement.  His alleged inquiries are unworthy of credit, as he could not even
mention any single superior officer from whom he inquired.â
[35]
 Moreover, the trial court found
that âfrom Quezon City, Orion, Bataan is reachable in some three (3) hours by
normal travel by bus.â
[36]
 Hence, the possibility that the
accused committed the crime in Bataan existed, even if he was indeed in Quezon
City on the day of the killing.


Crime Committed


The Court agrees
with the trial court that accused-appellant is guilty of murder qualified by
treachery.  It was established that the
âthe accused were armed with deadly weapons and with great superiority in
number rendered the unarmed victim helpless.â
[37]
 The lone prosecution eyewitness
testified that the accused entered their house and dragged her father out,
stabbing and hacking him thereafter with bladed weapons.  As such, âtreachery is deemed present in the
commission of the crime, accused having employed a method which tended directly
and specifically to insure the execution of their dastardly act without any
risk to themselves arising from whatever defense the victim might make.â
[38]


We likewise
agree with the trial court that the prosecution was unable to prove the
aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation.  For this circumstance to be appreciated, there must be proof, as
clear as the evidence of the crime itself,  of the following elements thereof, 
viz.: 
1) the time when the
offender determined to commit the crime, 2) an act manifestly indicating that
he or she clung to such determination, and 3) a sufficient lapse of time
between determination and execution to allow the offender to reflect upon the
consequences of his or her act.
[39]
 No evidence was presented by the
prosecution to establish said requisites.


Although the
Information alleged that the aggravating circumstance of nighttime attended the
commission of the crime,  the
prosecution failed to substantiate it.  No evidence was presented proving that the accused purposely utilized
this circumstance in order to facilitate the execution of their plan.
[40]


However, we note
that the trial court erred in not ordering the accused to pay civil indemnity
to the heirs of the victim.  This civil
liability should be imposed upon the appellant without need of further proof other
than the fact that he committed the crime.
[41]


Epilogue


In the
dispositive portion of the assailed Decision, the trial court stated simply
that Accused Gregorio Tulop and Salvador Baldeviano were guilty, without
specifying (a) the offense for which they were convicted, (b) the degree of
their participation therein and (c) their civil liability.  This disposition falls short of the
standards prescribed by Rule 120 of the Rules of Court, which provides:


âSEC. 2. 
Form and contents of
judgment. â xxx


If it is of conviction, the
judgment shall state (a) the legal qualification of the offense constituted by
the acts committed by the accused, and the aggravating or mitigating
circumstances attending the commission thereof, if there are any; (b) the
participation of the accused in the commission of the offense, whether as
principal, accomplice, or accessory after the fact; (c) the penalty imposed
upon the accused; and (d) the civil liability or damages caused by the wrongful
act to be recovered from the accused by the offended party, if there is any,
unless the enforcement of the civil liability by a separate action has been
reserved or waived.â


This Court,
therefore, urges the members of the bench to observe precision of language in
writing their decisions.  The dispositions
of courts must be complete by themselves, bereft of equivocation and
conflicting interpretations.  We have
said it before and we say it again: clarity and accuracy are shibboleths of the
judicial craft.
