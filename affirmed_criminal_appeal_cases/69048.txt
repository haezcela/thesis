CONTRARY TO LAW.
[5]
Essentially, the prosecution alleged that in separate incidents, Fornillos sexually abused AAA, then a 13-year old minor, all while he was equipped with a knife and threatening her of bodily harm should she divulge what happened. In particular, the series of sexual abuses were outlined as follows: 
first
, one evening in January 2006, AAA was walking towards a neighborhood store when she passed by Fornillos. Suddenly, Fornillos grabbed AAA and pulled her into a dark area and thereat, kissed and touched AAAâs breasts. After some time, AAA managed to escape Fornillosâ grip and was able to run away; 
second
, about a month later, or in the evening of February 22, 2006, AAA was supposed to go to a neighborâs house to watch television when Fornillos appeared out of nowhere, grabbed her, and then took her to a dark area, where Fornillos again touched AAAâs private parts;
[6]
 
third
, the next night, or on February 23, 2006, AAAâs father and Fornillos were having a drinking session at their house when AAAâs parents went out to gather firewood. Fornillos was able to gain access inside the house and while inside, inserted his penis into AAAâs mouth until a white substance came out therefrom; 
fourth
, in the afternoon of February 24, 2006, AAA was in school when Fornillos appeared by the school fence and motioned her to come near him. When AAA approached Fornillos, the latter took her to an isolated area where he again inserted his penis into AAAâs mouth until a whitish liquid came out; and 
fifth,
 in the evening of the same day, Fornillos and AAAâs father was then having a drinking spree when the latter ordered AAA to buy food at the neighborhood store. While AAA was on her way to the store, Fornillos caught up with her and started touching her private parts again, only letting her go when he heard AAAâs cousin looking for her. Finally, AAA told her mother about the incidents, prompting them to report the same to the authorities.
[7]
Initially, these cases were archived because Fornillos was nowhere to be found and remained at large. Eventually, he was arrested on May 22, 2012 and proceedings resumed with his arraignment, wherein he pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
[8]
 For his part, Fornillos averred that while he indeed had drinking sessions with AAAâs father, he denied the incidents of sexual abuse against AAA. He then claimed that he only met with AAA to tell her that they could not elope as the latter was still very young, and asked her to stop following him around.
[9]
The RTC Ruling
In a Decision
[10]
 dated March 24, 2014, the RTC found Fornillos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged, and accordingly, sentenced him as follows: (
a
) in Criminal Case No. CC-2007-1652, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages; (
b
) in Criminal Case No. CC-2007-1653, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages; (
c
) in Criminal Case No. CC-2007-1654, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of seventeen (17) years and five (5) months of 
reclusion temporal
, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum, and to pay AAA the amounts of P20,000.00 as civil indemnity, P15,000.00 as moral damages, and P15,000.00 as exemplary damages; (
d
) in Criminal Case No. CC-2007-1655, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of seventeen (17) years and five (5) months of 
reclusion temporal
, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum, and to pay AAA the amounts of P20,000.00 as civil indemnity, P15,000.00 as moral damages, and P15,000.00 as exemplary damages; and (
e
) in Criminal Case No. CC-2007-1656, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of seventeen (17) years and five (5) months of 
reclusion temporal
, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum, and to pay AAA the amounts of P20,000.00 as civil indemnity, P15,000.00 as moral damages, and P15,000.00 as exemplary damages.
[11]
The RTC found that the prosecution â through AAAâs honest, sincere, candid, and straightforward testimony â had established beyond reasonable doubt that Fornillos subjected AAA to a series of sexual abuses, wherein he inserted his penis into AAAâs mouth in two (2) separate incidents, and mashed her breasts in three (3) other separate incidents. In view of such positive testimony, the RTC disregarded Fornillosâ defense of denial, even pointing out that his flight indicates his guilt for the crimes charged against him.
[12]
Aggrieved, Fornillos appealed to the CA.
The CA Ruling
In a Decision
[13]
 dated February 15, 2017, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling with the following modifications: (
a
) in Criminal Case Nos. CC-2007-1652 and CC-2007-1653, Fornillos was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 medium, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum, and to pay AAA the amounts of P30,000.00 as civil indemnity, P30,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of Rape by Sexual Assault as defined and penalized under Article 266-A (2) of the RPC; and (
b
) in Criminal Case Nos. CC-2007-1654, CC-2007-1655, and CC-2007-1656, he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 medium, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum, and to pay AAA the amounts of P20,000.00 as civil indemnity, P15,000.00 as moral damages, and P15,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to RA 7610.
[14]
In upholding Fornillosâ conviction, the CA held that Fornillosâ repeated sexual abuses on the victim, AAA, were done through force and intimidation as he threatened the victim with a bladed instrument and forced her to submit to his bestial desires.
[15]
Hence, this appeal.
[16]
 
The Issue Before the Court
The issue for the Courtâs resolution is whether or not Fornillos is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Rape by Sexual Assault and three (3) counts of Acts of Lasciviousness.
The Courtâs Ruling
The appeal is bereft of merit.
Time and again, it has been held that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review, and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.
[17]
Guided by this consideration, the Court finds it proper to modify Fornillosâ convictions as will be explained hereunder.
At the outset, it must be stressed that the Court agrees with the findings of the courts 
a quo
 that the prosecution â through the positive, candid, straightforward, and unwavering testimony of AAA â was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Fornillos sexually abused AAA on five (5) separate incidents, wherein in two (2) of those instances, he inserted his penis into the latterâs mouth; while in the remaining three (3) occasions, he touched AAAâs private parts. Thus, the Court finds no reason to deviate from the factual findings of the trial court, as affirmed by the CA, as there is no indication that it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case. In fact, the trial court was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties, and hence, due deference should be accorded to the same.
[18]
 
However, there is a need to adjust the nomenclature of the crimes in question, the concomitant penalties attached thereto, and the civil liability 
ex delicto
 in accordance with the guidelines set by the Court 
En Banc
 in the very recent case of 
People v. Tulagan
 (
Tulagan
).
[19]
In 
Tulagan
, the Court threshed out the âapplicable laws and [consequent penalties] for the crimes of acts of lasciviousness or lascivious conduct and rape by carnal knowledge or sexual assault, depending on the age of the victim, in view of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 266-A and Article 336 of the [RPC], as amended by [Republic Act No. (RA)] 8353 and Section 5 (b) of [RA] 7610.â
[20]
 For this purpose, 
Tulagan
 provided a comprehensive table stating the proper nomenclature of crimes involving sexual abuse against children, to wit:
[21]
  
Age of Victim:
Crime Committed:
 
Under 12 years old or demented
12 years old or below 18, or 18 under special circumstances
18 years old and above

Sexual Assault under Article 266-A (2) of the RPC in relation to Section 5 (b) of RA 7610: 
reclusion temporal

Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of RA 7610: 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period to 
reclusion perpetua
Sexual Assault under Article 266-A (2) of the RPC: 
prision mayor
Applying the foregoing guidelines, as well as the fact that AAA was then a 13-year-old minor when the incidents of sexual abuse occurred, Fornillosâ conviction under Criminal Case Nos. CC-2007-1652, CC-2007-1653, CC-2007-1654, CC-2007-1655, and CC-2007-1656 should all be modified to â
Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of RA 7610
.â As such, in accordance with the Indeterminate Sentence Law,
[22]
 Fornillos must be sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of ten (10) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum, for each count of the aforesaid crime. Finally, he is also ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages, with legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum imposed on all monetary awards from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment,
[23]
 for each count of the aforesaid crime.
WHEREFORE
, the appeal is
