PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. JULIO FRANCISCO Y LOPEZ, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




DAVIDE JR., J.:


In what seems to be a continuation of a dream so surreal, Marilyn Perez 
(hereinafter 
MARILYN
), twelve years (12) old, woke up from her 
deep slumber between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. of all nights of 25 December 1997, in 
their residence in barangay Sagrada Familia, Hagonoy, Bulacan, to find her 
alleged stepfather Julio Francisco (
FRANCISCO
), sucking her 
nipples and inserting his male organ into her private parts.
[1]
 The bizarre situation assumed contemptible 
proportions by reason of the perverted intrepidity in which the dastardly deed 
was undertaken.


On that night, the family members slept side by side with each other on a 
single mat and under one mosquito net. MARILYN slept by the wall and beside her 
mother. On her mother's other side slept 
FRANCISCO
. Beside 

FRANCISCO
 slept his daughter with Felicidad. About a meter away 
was 
MARILYN
's brother. With these sleeping positions, 

FRANCISCO,
 as earlier detailed, was able to sexually violate 

MARILYN
.
[2]
 


MARILYN
 claimed that after the sexual transgression, 

FRANCISCO
 threatened her with a kitchen knife so as not to 
divulge the incident to anybody lest he kill her.
[3]
 But 
MARILYN
 seemed to 
have gathered courage for she was able to tap (
kalabit) 
her sleeping 
mother who woke up to find her husband atop her daughter. She heard her mother 
blurt out "Hey, why did you do that to my child? She is also your child! 
(
Hoy, bakit mo ginalaw ang aking anak? Anak mo na rin iyan!
).
[4]


Mother and daughter went to the house of the former's sister Virginia and 
told her the story. From there, the trio proceeded to the barangay hall to lodge 
a complaint. 
FRANCISCO
 was later on brought to the police 
station where he was incarcerated.


FRANCISCO
 was subsequently indicted for rape under an 
information which reads as follows:




The undersigned Asst. Provincial Prosecutor, on complaint of offended party, 
Marilyn M. Perez, accuses Julio Francisco y Lopez of the crime of rape, 
penalized under the provisions of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended 
by R. A. 8353 otherwise known as "The Anti-Rape Law of 1997, committed as 
follows:


That on or about the 25th day of December, 1997, in the municipality of 
Hagonoy, Province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then and there wilfully, unlawfully 
and feloniously, by means of force and intimidation, with lewd designs, have 
carnal knowledge of his stepdaughter, Marilyn M. Perez, 12 years old, against 
her will and without her consent.


Contrary to law.
[5]


FRANCISCO
 was arraigned on 20 May 1998 before the Regional 
Trial Court of Bulacan, Branch 21 in Malolos, whereby he entered a plea of "Not 
Guilty." His case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 529-M-98. After the 
mandatory pre-trial conference, trial on the merits ensued.


The prosecution first presented 
MARILYN
 who testified on 
matters tending to prove the above narration of facts. She also disclosed that 
the sexual molestation committed upon her by 
FRANCISCO
 on 
Christmas night of 1997 was not the first time. She revealed that since she was 
eight (8) years old she had been sexually assaulted for about five times already 
by 
FRANCISCO
. She remembered that her mother started living in 
with 
FRANCISCO
 when she was about seven (7) years old. Her 
natural father was already dead at that time.


The prosecution also presented the mother of 
MARILYN
, 
Felicidad Perez. She basically claimed that on the night in question, her 
daughter "touched (
kalabit
)" her which gesture woke her up. Felicidad 
then heard 
MARILYN
 say that 
FRANCISCO
 had lain 
on top of her. She then saw that 
FRANCISCO
 was indeed on top of 
her daughter who was silently weeping.
[6]
 
Felicidad asked 
FRANCISCO
 "why he placed himself on top of 
Marilyn when she thought all the while that he treated the girl as his own 
child." 
FRANCISCO
 remained silent.
[7]


Felicidad also admitted that the Christmas night incident was not the first 
time that
 FRANCISCO
 sexually abused 
MARILYN. 

In fact, 
MARILYN
 had been telling Felicidad of the 
sexual molestations which occurred since the former was in Grade Two. Felicidad 
remained patient with 
FRANCISCO
 because their union produced a 
daughter. In fact, she had personally caught 
FRANCISCO 
in 
coitus with 
MARILYN
 when the latter was in Grade Two.
[8]
 Felicidad claimed that 

FRANCISCO
 is her husband but admitted that they are not 
married.
[9]
 


Felicidad's other testimonial evidence coincided with 

MARILYN
's recital relative to 
FRANCISCO
's 
arrest.


Dr. Manuel Aves of the Bulacan Provincial Crime Laboratory Office was also 
called to the witness stand to confirm the medical findings he made after 
conducting a physical examination on 
MARILYN
 on 29 December 
1997. Dr. Aves stated that his findings revealed that "there were multiple 
[hymenal] healed lacerations at 12, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 10 o'clock with abrasions and 
swelling." He concluded that said results manifested recent sexual 
manipulations.
[10]
 


For its part, the defense first presented accused
 FRANCISCO
. 
He denied the accusation and gave the excuse that he was sleeping on the night 
and time in question. He rationalized that his wife, furious at his failure to 
adequately provide for the family needs aggravated by the fact that she had to 
earn money during the Christmas season, concocted the malevolent scheme.


He then admitted that he had been living with Felicidad without the benefit 
of marriage which relationship produced a daughter who was already eight (8) 
years old.
[11]
 He also testified that 

MARILYN 
lived with the sister of Felicidad and only visited the 
family.


The defense also presented Benigno Mercado who admitted that 

FRANCISCO
 was his uncle. He claimed that he visited 

FRANCISCO
 at the Hagonoy Municipal Jail when the investigation 
was being conducted. He heard 
MARILYN
 state that "there was no 
penetration, only touching by the accused." He later admitted on 
cross-examination that he did not hear the entire declarations of 

MARILYN
.
[12]
 


Both 
MARILYN
 and 
FRANCISCO
 took the witness 
stand again as rebuttal witness and sur-rebuttal witness, respectively.


In its decision of 28 October 1998, the trial court
[13]
 convicted 
FRANCISCO
. The 
trial court believed the testimony of
 MARILYN 
that she was 
sexually violated by accused 
FRANCISCO
 on the night of 25 
December 1997. The trial court considered the testimony of 

MARILYN
's mother to have strengthened the girl's testimony. The 
positive identification of 
FRANCISCO
 and Dr. Aves' findings or 
physical evidence likewise "jibed and confirmed" 
MARILYN
's 
testimony "giving no reason to doubt that there was consummation of the sexual 
intercourse."


Against the damning evidence of the prosecution, the trial court considered 
the defense's denial a "self-serving negative evidence x which cannot stand 
against the affirmative testimonies of prosecution witnesses." The trial court 
also brushed aside the insinuation of the defense that it was physically 
impossible for 
FRANCISCO
 to commit the crime given the sleeping 
positions of the protagonists, his alleged physical infirmity and 

MARILYN
's disclosure on cross-examination that "her shorts and 
underwear were rolled down half-way above the knee and her legs were spread for 
about one and one-half (1Â½) feet only."


For the trial court, the first pretext had been amply refuted by the 
declaration of 
MARILYN
 that she woke up to find 

FRANCISCO
 sucking her nipples and inserting his male organ into 
her vagina and supported by the mother's testimony that she saw her husband on 
top of
 MARILYN
. Besides, the trial court added, rape can be 
committed in the most unlikely places. Further, 
FRANCISCO
 had 
on five previous occasions successfully imposed his evil intentions upon 

MARILYN
 which could have "emboldened him to throw caution into 
the winds" and to once again impose his lechery on the girl that Christmas 
night. The trial court also rejected F
RANCISCO
's alleged 
physical defect considering that it did not hinder him from working as a 
fisherman and in siring a daughter with Felicidad. As to the third alleged 
exculpating reason, the trial court declared that the fact that the shorts and 
underwear were not completely removed from the legs or that the legs were just 
one and one-half feet apart was not sufficient obstacle to a person bent on 
perpetrating a criminal act. The trial court observed that "[i]t is conceded 
from human experience that (under said circumstances) sexual intercourse would 
be difficult, but (not) physically impossible if we consider that the victim was 
initially asleep and when awakened, she was not in a position to resist." It is 
also likely that 
MARILYN
 did oversleep given her tender 
age.


The trial court also noted the inconsistencies and contradictions in the 
testimony of 
MARILYN
, but concluded that the same failed to 
override the sincerity and candor of the girl when she said she was raped for 
she said in effect all that has to be said on the occasion. The trial court then 
proclaimed that the presence of the special circumstance of relationship 
indicated in Section 11 of R.A. 7659 qualified the rape which necessitated the 
imposition of the death penalty. It found undisputed (1) MARILYN'S age, which 
was about twelve (12) years old at the time of the commission of the crime as 
evidenced by a birth certificate
[14]
 and 
the lack of objection thereto by the defense; and (2) 

FRANCISCO
's relationship with 
MARILYN
 as 
either that of a stepfather or common-law spouse of Felicidad by the defense's 
lack of objection to or denial of Felicidad's testimony that 

FRANCISCO
 is her husband.


The trial court also discarded as not fatal to the prosecution's cause, the 
absence in the Information of the exact words that "offender 

FRANCISCO
 is the stepfather of 12-year old
 
MARILYN
 or common-law spouse of the parent of the latter" so as to 
explicitly constitute the qualifying circumstance of relationship mentioned in 
Section 11 of R.A. 7659. Thus, the dispositive portion reads as follows:




Wherefore, all premises considered, the Court resolves that the prosecution 
has successfully undertaken its burden to prove the guilt of accused Julio 
Francisco y Lopez beyond reasonable doubt. For having violated Article 335 of 
the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659 with the attendant 
circumstance that "the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the 
offender is a x x x stepfather, x x x or the common-law spouse of the parent of 
the victim", accused Julio Francisco y Lopez is hereby found GUILTY of the crime 
of Rape as charged. Absent any circumstance that could mitigate the commission 
thereof, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the Supreme Penalty of Death by lethal 
injection.


In line with established jurisprudence, the said accused is also ordered to 
indemnify the offended party Marilyn Perez in the sum of P50,000.00 for moral 
damages.


With costs against the accused.


SO ORDERED.
[15]
 


In view of the penalty imposed, the case is brought on automatic appeal to 
this Court pursuant to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by 
Section 22 of R. A. 7659.


In his Appellant's Brief,
 FRANCISCO
 attributes to the trial 
court as errors (1) its finding that his guilt was proven beyond reasonable 
doubt, (2) in giving credence to the inconsistent and incredible testimonies of 
the prosecution witnesses, (3) in rejecting the defense's exculpating evidence, 
and (4) in imposing the death penalty despite the erroneous allegation in the 
information of the special qualifying circumstance of relationship. 


FRANCISCO
 then specifies the following testimonial 
inconsistencies and contradictions as undermining the credibility of the 
prosecution witnesses and the possibility of the crime having been 
committed:


MARILYN
 was not sure whether she tapped her mother before 
or after 
FRANCISCO
 went on top of her.


She was uncertain whether her undergarments and shorts were removed or 
merely rolled-down the middle of her thighs.


She also equivocated on whether she was completely undressed when her mother 
found
 FRANCISCO
 in a coitus position atop her.


She claimed to have seen a whitish sticky substance discharged from 

FRANCISCO
's penis although she said that the lights were off 
and the penis was being inserted into her when she awakened.


She claimed that 
FRANCISCO
 was wearing shorts with buttons 
while her mother claimed he was clad in briefs.


She said 
FRANCISCO
 asked her to masturbate him after he 
ejaculated - a claim that cannot be substantiated with true to life experience. 



FRANCISCO
 also insists on the absence of the qualifying 
circumstance of relationship considering that he was never married to Felicidad, 
hence he could not be the stepfather of 
MARILYN
. He was merely 
the common-law spouse of Felicidad which detail was not alleged in the 
information, hence he could not be convicted of qualified rape and be meted out 
the death penalty, all in consonance with the Court's ruling in 
People v. 
Dimapilis
.
[16]
 


The Office of the Solicitor General counters, however, that the 
inconsistencies do not prove that the rape was not committed nor do they 
depreciate the probative value of the overwhelming proofs adduced by the 
prosecution of the fact of rape.
 MARILYN
's positive 
identification of 
FRANCISCO 
and her testimony that he was 
sucking her nipples and inserting his private parts into hers when she woke up 
on the date in question, as collaborated by the other evidence of the 
prosecution particularly the medical findings of genital swelling and abrasions, 
proved beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of 
FRANCISCO
. The 
defense of denial failed to overcome this clear and foregone conclusion.


The Office of the Solicitor General, however, agrees with 

FRANCISCO
 that there is no qualified rape and opines that the 
case falls squarely with or is similar to 
People v. Dimapilis
. It 
respectfully recommends the modification of the assailed decision with the 
reduction of the penalty from death to 
reclusion perpetua
. We affirm 


FRANCISCO
's conviction.


The issues raised herein primarily dealt with the credibility of the 
prosecution witnesses particularly 
MARILYN
. 

FRANCISCO
 harps on the inconsistencies and contradictions in 
the statements of 
MARILYN
 and her mother which allegedly cast 
serious doubt on their credibility and the fact of the crime having been 
committed. It is, however, jurisprudentially settled that findings of the trial 
court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled great weight on appeal unless 
cogent reasons are presented necessitating a reexamination, if not a disturbance 
of the same; the reason being the former is in a better and unique position of 
hearing first hand the witnesses and observing their deportment, conduct and 
attitude.
[17]


A careful scrutiny of the records reveals no cogent reason requiring a 
disturbance of the trial court's findings. We agree with the trial court in 
affording full credit and merit to 
MARILYN
's testimony that she 
was raped. The medical findings conclusively support the testimonial evidence of 
rape. Besides, when a woman says that she has been raped, she says in effect, 
all that is necessary to show that she has indeed been raped.
[18]
 


We likewise affirm the trial court's conclusion that 

FRANCISCO
's impugnment of the prosecution's evidence failed to 
destroy the prosecution's case. The inconsistent and conflicting statements 
averred to in the Appellant's Brief are not entirely irreconcilable with or even 
material to the fact of rape.


Whether 
MARILYN
 tapped or touched her mother before or after 
the rape is inconsequential. The truth is 
MARILYN
 reached out 
to her mother in an attempt to wake her up and discover the disgusting deed 
being perpetrated by her common-law husband. On the averment that 

MARILYN
 prevaricated on whether her undergarments and shorts 
were completely taken off or were merely rolled halfway down her thigh is again 
trifling. Either situation could not have prevented a perverse and lecherous 
mind from unleashing its lust on a hapless girl. Further, it is 
jurisprudentially recognized that lust is no respecter of time and place and may 
be committed even inside cramped quarters.
[19]


The other averred incredulous claims of 
MARILYN
 (seeing a 
whitish sticky substance discharged by 
FRANCISCO
 even though 
the lights were off and being required to masturbate 
FRANCISCO
 
after the fact of rape) and Felicidad (observing 
FRANCISCO
 as 
clad in briefs) refer to irrelevant and trite matters that, it is reiterated 
here, do not and could not disparage the credibility of the prosecution 
witnesses to the extent of invalidating the entire prosecution's case. For truth 
be told, the defense's efforts to shred the threads of coherence and congruity 
that firmly bind the prosecution's case appear futile, foolish and nugatory.


This Court thus discards the defense of denial interposed by 

FRANCISCO
. In so doing, we resort once again to the primordial 
doctrinal predication, whose sagacity and truth remain as constant as the 
progression of the years in which it has been applied, that denial, like alibi, 
as an exonerating justification is inherently weak and if uncorroborated 
regresses to blatant impotence. A mere denial, just like alibi, constitutes a 
self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary 
weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative 
matters.
[20]
 


A careful scrutiny of 
FRANCISCO
's other pretexts like the 
imputation to Felicidad that she concocted the rape charge in reprisal of his 
alleged inability to satisfactorily provide for the family needs discloses the 
frivolity of the defense's cause. On that specific item, however, we decree that 
it is unnatural for a parent, more so, a mother to use her offspring as an 
instrument of malice or retribution if it will subject her child to the 
humiliation, disgrace and even stigma attendant to the prosecution of rape, if 
she were not motivated solely and rightly by the desire to incarcerate the 
person responsible for the child's defilement if the same is not true.
[21]
 Felicidad precisely wanted 

FRANCISCO
 behind bars because motherly concerns prevailed over 
a love gone errant. She had already caught him previously sexually molesting 

MARILYN
 and had known of the other sexual abuses he committed 
which acts she had condoned but not the abomination committed on Christmas night 
right next to her. In fact, 
FRANCISCO
 should be held culpable 
for these previous acts of lechery if proven in separate cases.


In sum, it is clear that the prosecution persuasively discharged its onus of 
proving the guilt of 
FRANCISCO
 beyond reasonable doubt. Despite 
this affirmation of the trial court's judgment of conviction, we, nonetheless, 
agree with 
FRANCISCO
's contention and that of the Office of the 
Solicitor General that the death penalty cannot be imposed.


We agree that this case is similar to the factual settings of 
People v. 
Dimapilis.
 In the informations of the instant case and in 
People v. 
Dimapilis
, the victims, who were below eighteen (18) years old, have been 
stated as the stepdaughters of accused-appellants; yet, the evidence indubitably 
show that accused-appellants are the common-law spouses of the victims' 
mothers.
[22]
 In both instances, the 
victims' mothers are not married to accused-appellants. Both accused-appellants 
cannot therefore be considered as the respective stepfather of the victims, for 
that relationship presupposes a legitimate relationship, 
i.e
., they 
should have been legally married to the mothers' victims. A stepfather is the 
husband of one's mother by virtue of a marriage subsequent to that of which the 
person spoken of is the offspring; or, a stepdaughter is a daughter of one's 
spouse by a previous marriage or the daughter of one of the spouses by a former 
marriage.
[23]
 


But notwithstanding the unequivocal proof at the trial of this case and in 

People v. Dimapilis
, of the special circumstance that accused-appellants 
were the common-law spouses of the victims' mothers, said relationship could not 
be considered as such because it was not specifically alleged in the 
information. Special qualifying circumstances indicated in the amendatory 
provisions of Section 11 of R.A. 7659 must be specifically pleaded or alleged 
with certainty in the information; otherwise the death penalty cannot be 
imposed.
[24]
 to impose the death penalty 
on the basis of relationship, which has not been alleged in the information, 
would violate 
FRANCISCO
's constitutional and statutory right to 
be informed of the nature and the cause of the accusation against him.
[25]
 


With this favorable serendipity, 
FRANCISCO
 can only be 
convicted of simple rape where the proper imposable penalty is 
reclusion 
perpetua
 under the second paragraph of Article 335, now Article 266-A of the 
Revised Penal Code, in view of the amendments of R.A. 8353
[26]
and R.A. 7659. Nonetheless, this does not 
preclude this Court from imposing, in addition to the moral damages already 
decreed, civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000 which the trial court 
inadvertently omitted. 


WHEREFORE, 
IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the decision of 28 October 
1998 of the Regional Trial Court of Bulacan, Branch 21 in Malolos, in Criminal 
Case No. 529-M-98 convicting herein accused-appellant Julio Francisco y Lopez of 
qualified rape is hereby MODIFIED. As modified, accused-appellant is hereby 
declared guilty beyond reasonable doubt of simple rape as defined and penalized 
under the new Article 266-A of Revised Penal Code pursuant to R.A. No. 8353, 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and ordered to pay 
MARILYN PEREZ the amounts of P50,000 as civil indemnity and P50,000 as moral 
damages.


Costs against accused-appellant.
