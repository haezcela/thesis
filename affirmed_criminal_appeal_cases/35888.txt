PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. FERMIN IGAT, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. 
D E C I S I O N




BELLOSILLO, J.:




FERMIN IGAT, adjudged guilty of raping his 14-year old daughter, was sentenced to 
reclusion perpetua
 and ordered to indemnify her the sum of P50,000.00.
[1]
 He now interposes this appeal from his conviction.
[2]
Accused-appellant anchors his appeal for reversal of the judgment
 against him on the theory that the prosecution failed to establish his 
guilt with the quantum of proof required to overcome the constitutional 
presumption of innocence in his favor. Alternatively, he proposes that 
should his conviction be sustained Art. 27 of the Revised Penal Code be 
applied to him so that the 
reclusion perpetua
 imposed on him will have a duration of twenty (20) years and one (1) day to forty (40) years.

The facts: On 10 December 1990, between 6:30 and 7:00 oâclock in 
the evening, after Gresilda finished supper with her parents at Brgy. 
Dangkalan, Molinao, Aklan, her brother Richard arrived from a basketball
 game at nearby Brgy. Malandayon. He went straight to the kitchen and 
took his supper. While he was eating Richard was scolded by his father 
for coming late. Openiana, wife of Fermin and mother of Richard, took up
 the cudgels for her son. She told Fermin that Richard was already old 
enough to play basketball at his pleasure. Fermin resented her 
intervention. He got his bolo and sent Openiana and Richard scampering 
away. Richard spent the night at an auntâs place in Liloan, Malinao, 
Aklan, while Openiana went into hiding elsewhere and returned home only 
the following morning.

Meanwhile, during the exchanges between her parents, Gresilda 
retired to her room. A little later, after the noise had subsided and 
Gresilda had fallen asleep, she was suddenly awakened by someone mashing
 her body, particularly her breasts and sexual organ. Since it was dark 
she could only meekly ask who it was and the reply came in a familiar 
voice, 
"I, ne."
 It was her father. 

Gresilda was dumb-founded. She could not do anything. Her father 
threatened to kill her if she made any false move. He covered her mouth 
with one hand and continued to mash her sensitive parts with his other 
hand. In no time, he removed her panties and placed himself on top of 
her. With his libido now approaching its threshold, if not precisely 
because of it, he sexually assaulted his daugther. Initially, he did not
 succeed; however, in due time, he was able to consummate the act with 
her who later claimed she suffered as a result excruciating pain in her 
vagina and abdomen. After satisfying his lust, the accused warned 
Gresilda never to squeal or he would kill her, together with her mother,
 brothers and sisters, if she disobeyed.

Left alone, sore and sorry, Gresilda put on her panties, now torn
 as a consequence of her misfortune. She remained pensive in her room. 
The next morning, Gresilda noticed blood in her underwear, or what's 
left of it, so she changed it. She saw her father wash her torn panties 
afterwards. She absented herself from school because she was in pain and
 her gait was impaired. When her mother returned home Gresilda refrained
 from narrating to her the bestial acts done to her by her father. On 13
 December 1990 Gresilda attended her classes but spoke nothing about the
 incident to her schoolmates. She did not report the matter to the 
police either. 

On 12 January 1991 Gresilda was raped again by her father but she
 still remained mum about it as she was afraid of him. She had a sigh of
 relief however on 26 April 1991 when, without knowing what happened, 
her sister Teresa went to fetch her in Brgy. Dangkalan for a vacation in
 Manila. They left that same day for Brgy. Dumga, Makato, Aklan, where 
they stayed for two (2) days at the house of a certain Junior Trasmil 
before proceeding to Manila on 28 April 1991 aboard 
"M/V DoÃ±a Fatima"

 with Trasmil and one Jun dela Cruz. While at sea and unable to contain 
herself any further, Gresilda finally revealed to her sister what their 
father did to her. 

Upon reaching Manila, Gresilda and Teresa conferred with their 
eldest sister Susan and their aunt Bernardita Igat on what to do with 
their father. On 7 May 1991 Teresa and Gresilda decided to return to 
Aklan to charge him in court. 

On 8 May 1991 Gresilda had herself physically examined by Dr. 
Simeon A. Arce, Jr., of the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital. 
His medico-legal report was attached to her criminal complaint filed by 
her with the assistance of her eldest brother Gilbert Igat. On 19 June 
1991 the corresponding Information was filed, docketed as Crim. Case No.
 3368.

A careful evaluation of the evidence on record fails to disclose 
any compelling reason to disbelieve the facts established by prosecution
 witnesses Dr. Simeon Arce, Jr., Teresa and Richard Igat, and the 
offended party herself Gresilda Igat, who positively identified her 
father in open court as her ravisher. 

The only defense accused-appellant could muster was denial after 
pleading not guilty to the charge. His version was that in the evening 
of 10 December 1990 he spent an uneventful night with his wife Openiana 
at her parents' house in Bgy. Dangkalan, Malinao, Aklan, together with 
their children Gresilda, Richard, Gilbert and Gliceria, who was with her
 husband Noel Vargas and two (2) children. Fermin denied having scolded 
Richard that evening of 10 December 1990 and having quarrelled with his 
wife Openiana and son Richard to the point of driving them out of the 
house with his bolo. He also denied having raped his own daughter, 
suggesting to the court that it was improbable to do so since Gresilda 
slept on the bamboo bed in the kitchen facing the door while Openiana 
was beside her with appellant on the other side near the sala, and in 
the adjoining room were Richard and Gilbert. The rest of the nipa house 
was occupied by Gliceriaâs family.

The wobbly version of the defense was attempted to be augmented 
with the equally flawed testimonies of Noel Vargas, Juanito Iscala a 
neighbor, and Primilin Narciso who presented class records showing that 
Gresilda was not marked "absent" from her class on 11 December 1990.

In the high-profile case of 
People v. Echegaray
,
[3]
 involving the incestuous rape by a father of a hapless daughter, we had occasion to observe thus -



Considering that a rape charge, in the light of the reimposition of
 the death penalty, requires a thorough and judicious examination of the
 circumstances relating thereto, this Court remains guided by the 
following principles in evaluating evidence in cases of this nature: (a)
 An accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to 
prove but more difficult for the accused though innocent to disprove; 
(b) In view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two 
persons are involved, the testimony of the complainant must be 
scrutinized with extreme caution; and, (c) The evidence for the 
prosecution must stand and fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed
 to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense 
(cited cases omitted).
  




Like the 15-year old Ronalyn in 
People v. Magpantay
[4]

 who was thrice raped by her own father, the victim in the case at bar, 
Gresilda, could not have been easily convinced to have herself 
physically examined and thereafter undergo the ordeals of a public trial
 and testifying against her own father if she was not motivated by her 
desire to seek justice. Citing 
People v. Caballes
,
[5]
 we held in Magpantay that - 



Given complainantâs naivete and inexperience in matters of 
sexuality, it was improbable that she would fabricate matters about the 
rapes committed against her person and concoct lies against her own 
father, knowing fully well the seriousness of such charges, even 
granting that she harbored abhorrence for his ways, and run the risk of 
subjecting herself to humiliating and embarrassing scrutiny wrought by a
 public trial. 




By Gresilda's own testimony, the rape committed by her father was the
 first time ever that she had known a man carnally, a new experience 
which should have been attended by mutual love, romance and passion for a
 young Filipina like her. Hence, it is not without reason that, as she 
recounted in court how her father had forced her to have sex with him, 
certain inconsistencies and contradictions would surface. In this regard
 we reiterate our view expressed in 
People v. Tumala, Jr
.
[6]
 - 



Error-free testimonies cannot be expected most especially when a 
witness is recounting details of a harrowing experience, one which even 
an adult would like to bury in oblivion. The court cannot expect a rape 
victim to remember all the ugly details of the appalling outrage, 
particularly so since she might in fact be wishing to forget them.
[7]






The Court believes in the story of Gresilda. As observed by the trial
 court, she was in tears when she related how she was raped and 
positively identified her father as the perpetrator of the dastardly 
act.
[8]
 Her assertions were 
"direct, positive, straight-forward and candid x x x that she was raped 
by her father in the evening of December 10, 1990, in the manner and 
form narrated by her."
[9]
 
Moreover, there is nothing in the record from which to conclude that 
Gresilda had ill motives to falsely testify against her own father. The 
testimony of a rape victim is credible where she has no motive to 
testify falsely against the accused
[10]
who, incidentally and unfortunately, is her own father. 

The defense attempted to discredit Gresilda on the following 
points: (a) that she contradicted herself when she stated during her 
direct testimony that her father placed a bolo on her neck to prevent 
her from shouting, while on cross-examination she said that her father 
did not carry a bolo when he entered her room to rape her; (b) that 
according to the medico-legal officer, Gresildaâs hymenal tear could 
have just been a week old at the time of examination so that the sexual 
intercourse must have occurred while Gresilda was with Junior Trasmil in
 his house or in Manila; and, (c) that Teresa Igat could not be a 
competent witness since she was "possessed" by an "evil spirit" and was 
undergoing treatment by a "medico" in the person of Junior Trasmil.

A careful perusal of Gresildaâs cross-examination readily shows 
that she did not categorically state that her father was not carrying a 
bolo when he entered her room. Thus -



Cross-Examination by Atty. A. Iligan;
  


x x x x
  


Q: And in fact you did not notice your father enter the room where you were sleeping?
  


A: No.
  


Q: And you also did not notice when he was allegedly mashing your sex organ that he carried something?
  


A: I do not know if he is (sic) carrying something.
  


Q: The reason is because it was very dark that night?
  


A: Yes.
[11]






It was during the direct examination that Gresilda testified in no 
uncertain terms that her father placed a bolo on her neck and covered 
her mouth as he warned her not to shout, then vividly recalled how he 
removed the bolo on her neck and placed it beside her before he raised 
her housedress, removed her panties and forcibly inserted his penis into
 her vagina.
[12]
 Thus, the 
contradiction referred to by the defense is obviously nonexistent. 
Similarly, the insinuation that the rape happened while Gresilda was 
with Trasmil by virtue of Dr. Arceâs description of Gresildaâs hymenal 
tear being "fresh or within a week tear" distorted the testimony of the 
examining physician as a whole. He only used the phrase "fresh or within
 a week tear" to differentiate an old hymenal tear that had no bleeding 
with the edges being well-rounded and without any congestion from a 
fresh one.
[13]


With respect to Teresaâs testimony, it was presented merely as a 
corroborative evidence. It is of no moment that Gresilda allegedly told 
Teresa to withdraw the complaint after the prosecution had already 
rested
[14]
 because even an 
affidavit of desistance or a pardon by the offended party cannot justify
 the dismissal of the complaint for rape considering that the pardon 
should have been made prior to the institution of the criminal action.
[15]


Of utmost significance is the basic principle that in rape cases 
the gravamen of the offense is sexual intercourse with a woman against 
her will or without her consent. The medical certificate issued by Dr. 
Arce showed an old hymenal tear, 9:00 oâclock in location, which could 
have happened at the time alleged by the victim. This complements 
Gresildaâs claim that her father had sexual intercourse with her without
 her consent. She had consistently, emotionally and convincingly 
narrated at the trial how his father intimidated her so as to leave her 
with no other option but to meekly submit to his lust. In a recent case
[16]
 we laid emphasis on the different facets of intimidation relative to rape cases -



Intimidation in rape cases is not calibrated nor governed by hard 
and fast rules. Since it is addressed to the victim and is therefore 
subjective, it must be viewed in light of the victimâs perception and 
judgment at the time of the commission of the crime. It is enough that 
the intimidation produced fear -- fear that if the victim did not yield 
to the bestial demands of the accused, something far worse would happen 
to her at that moment. Where such intimidation existed and the victim 
was cowed into submission as a result thereof, thereby rendering 
resistance futile, it would be the height of unreasonableness to expect 
the victim to resist with all her might and strength. If resistance 
would nevertheless be futile because of intimidation, then offering none
 at all does not mean consent to the assault so as to make the victimâs 
submission to the sexual act voluntary 
(cited cases omitted)
. 


In any event, in a rape committed by a father against his own 
daughter, as in this case, the formerâs moral ascendancy or influence 
over the latter substitutes for violence or intimidation
 
(cited cases omitted)
. 




Appellant further tried to discredit Gresildaâs version by 
enumerating certain instances which he regarded as contrary to human 
experience. He argued that a rapist cannot hold his penis with two (2) 
hands while committing the crime, and that a victim cannot possibly 
afford to attend school the following day if she suffered some bleeding 
on account thereof. Furthermore, he wondered why Gresilda failed to 
immediately report the rape if it was true, and insisted that it was 
improbable that he raped her given the limited area of their nipa house 
with several occupants at the time of the supposed incident.

There is a stark indication in appellantâs brief that he has a 
strong inclination to misconstrue the facts as presented by the 
prosecution. Gresilda withstood the cross-examination regarding the use 
of both hands by her father in inserting his penis into her vagina by 
explaining that initially her father was frustrated but after sometime 
he succeeded while on top of her. Thus, we can safely assume that in the
 course of Ferminâs attempts to force his penis into Gresildaâs vagina 
he could have freed one hand or even both hands until he finally 
consummated the act. Whether he held his penis with both hands to 
penetrate Gresilda, or whether Gresilda went to school on 11 December 
1990 and delayed the reporting of the sexual assault were simply minor 
matters too trivial to affect the prosecutionâs case for rape.
[17]


The bottom-line remains that the assertions of Gresilda as to the
 facts prior to and after the incident were positively corroborated by 
her brother Richard and her sister Teresa. The witnesses of Fermin could
 only come up with negative testimonies which are of lesser value for 
the reason that he who denies a certain fact may not remember exactly 
the circumstances on which he bases his denial.
[18]

 The trial court even found the testimonies of the defense witnesses as 
studied, deliberate, rehearsed and somehow biased in favor of the 
appellant. We have no reason to disagree. Appellantâs bare denial cannot
 overcome the categorical testimony of Gresilda, the victim.
[19]


Quite telling is the fact that appellant lost no time in fleeing 
Aklan province after learning about the rape charges against him. He 
offered no plausible explanation for his precipitate departure. Hence, 
his flight is a clear indication of his guilt.

On the claim of accused-appellant that the duration of his imprisonment of 
reclusion perpetua

 be twenty (20) years and one (1) day to forty (40) years, suffice it to
 state that the crime was committed on 10 December 1990 or long before 
RA No. 7659 took effect on 31 December 1993, hence, there was as yet no 
cause for confusion as to whether 
reclusion perpetua
 as a penalty was indivisible or not. Art. 27 of the Revised Penal Code, before its amendment, provided -



ART. 27. 
Reclusion perpetua
. - Any person sentenced to any of the perpetual penalties shall be pardoned after undergoing the penalty for 
thirty years
,
 unless such person by reason of his conduct or some other serious cause
 shall be considered by the Chief Executive as unworthy of pardon 
(underscoring supplied.)
  




WHEREFORE
, the appealed decision finding 
accused-appellant FERMIN IGAT guilty of raping his 14-year old daughter 
Gresilda Igat, sentencing him to reclusion perpetua and to indemnify her
 in the amount of P50,000.00 is AFFIRMED. Costs against 
accused-appellant.
