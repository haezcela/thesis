D E C I S I O N




CARPIO, J.:


The Case
This is a special civil action for 
certiorari
[1]
 seeking to review and nullify the Resolution
[2]
 dated 2 February 2011 and the Order
[3]
 dated 12 January 2011 of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) En Banc in 
Dra. Sigrid S. Rodolfo v. Romeo D. Lonzanida
, docketed as SPA No. 09-158 (DC). The petition asserts that the COMELEC issued the Resolution and Order with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.
The Facts
Romeo D. Lonzanida (Lonzanida) and Estela D. Antipolo (Antipolo) were candidates for Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales in the May 2010 National and Local Elections. Lonzanida Hied his certificate of candidacy on 1 December 2009.
[4]
 On 8 December 2009, Dra. Sigrid S. Rodolfo (Rodolfo) filed a petition under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code to disqualify Lonzanida and to deny due course or to cancel Lonzanida's certificate of candidacy on the ground that Lonzanida was elected, and had served, as mayor of San Antonio, Zambales for four (4) consecutive terms immediately prior to the term for the May 2010 elections. Rodolfo asserted that Lonzanida made a false material representation in his certificate of candidacy when Lonzanida certified under oath that he was eligible for the office he sought election. Section 8, Article X of the 1987 Constitution
[5]
 and Section 43(b) of the Local Government Code
[6]
 both prohibit a local elective official from being elected and serving for more than three consecutive terms for the same position.
The COMELEC Second Division rendered a Resolution
[7]
 on 18 February 20)0 cancelling Lonzanida's certificate of candidacy. Pertinent portions of the 18 February 2010 Resolution read:
Respondent Lonzanida never denied having held the office of mayor of San Antonio, Zambales for more than nine consecutive years. Instead he raised arguments to forestall or dismiss the petition on the grounds other man the main issue itself. We find such arguments as wanting. Respondent Lonzanida, for holding the office of mayor for more than three consecutive terms, went against the three-term limit rule; therefore, he could not be allowed lo run anew in the 2010 elections. It is time to infuse new blood in the political arena of San Antonio.
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED. The Certificate of Candidacy of Respondent Romeo D. Lonzanida for the position of mayor in the municipality of San Antonio, Zambales is hereby CANCELLED. His name is hereby ordered STRICKEN OFF the list of Official Candidates for the position of Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales in May 10, 2010 elections.
SO ORDERED.
[8]
Lonzanida's motion for reconsideration before the COMELEC En Banc remained pending during the May 2010 elections, Lonzanida and Efren Racel Aratea (Aratea) garnered the highest number of voles and were respectively proclaimed Mayor and Vice-Mayor.
 
Aratea took his oath of office as Acting Mayor before Regional Trial Court (RTC) Judge Raymond C. Viray of Branch 75, Olongapo City on 5 July 2010.
[9]
 On the same date, Aratea wrote the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and requested for an opinion on whether, as Vice-Mayor, he was legally required to assume the Office of the Mayor in view of Lonzanida's disqualification. DILG Legal Opinion No. 117, S. 2010
[10]
 stated that Lonzanida was disqualified to hold office by reason of his criminal conviction. As a consequence of Lonzanida's disqualification, the Office of the Mayor was deemed permanently vacant. Thus, Aratea should assume the Office of the Mayor in an acting capacity without prejudice to the COMELEC's resolution of Lonzanida's motion for reconsideration. In another letter dated 6 August 2010, Aratea requested the DILG to allow him to take the oath of office as Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales. In his response dated 24 August 2010, then Secretary Jesse M. Robredo allowed Aratea to take an oath of office as "the permanent Municipal Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales without prejudice however to the outcome of the cases pending before the [COMELEC]."
[11]
On 11 August 2010, the COMELEC En Bane Issued a Resolution
[12]
 disqualifying Lonzanida from running for Mayor in the May 2010 elections. The COMELEC En Banc's resolution was based on two grounds: 
first
, Lonzanida had been elected and had served as Mayor for more than three consecutive terms without interruption; and 
second
, Lonzanida had been, convicted by final judgment often (10) counts of falsification under the Revised Penal Code. Lonzanida was sentenced for each count of falsification to imprisonment of four (4) years and one (1) day of 
prisi&oacuten correccional
 as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prisi&oacuten mayor
 as maximum. The judgment of conviction became final on 23 October 2009 in the Decision of this Court in 
Lonzanida v. People
,
[13]
 before. Lonzanida filed his certificate of candidacy on 1 December Pertinent portions of the 11 August 2010 Resolution read:
Prescinding from the foregoing premises, Lonzanida, for having served as Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales for more than three (3) consecutive terms and for having been convicted by a final judgment of a crime punishable by more than one (1) year of imprisonment, is clearly disqualified to run for the same position in the May 2010 Elections.
WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED.
SO ORDERED.
[14]
On 25 August 2010, Antipolo filed a Motion for Leave to Intervene and to Admit Attached Petition-in-Intervention.
[15]
 She claimed her right to he proclaimed as Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales because Lonzanida ceased to be a candidate when the COMELEC Second Division, through its 18 February 2010 Resolution, ordered the cancellation of his certificate of candidacy and the striking out of his name from the list of official candidates for the position of Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales in the May 2010 elections.
In his Comment filed on 26 January 2011, Aratea asserted that Antipolo, as the candidate who received the second highest number of votes, could not be proclaimed as the winning candidate. Since Lonzanida's disqualification was not yet final during election day, the votes cast in his favor could not be declared stray. Lonzanida's subsequent disqualification resulted in a permanent vacancy in the Office of Mayor and Aratea, as the duly-elected Vice-Mayor, was mandated by Section 44
[16]
 of the Local Government Code to succeed as Mayor.
The COMELEC's Rulings
The COMELEC En Bane issued an Order dated 12 January 2011, stating:
Acting on the "Motion for Leave to Intervene and to Admit Attached Petition-in-Intervention" filed by Eslela D. Aniipolo (Antipolo) and pursuant to the power of this Commission to suspend its Rules or any portion' thereof in the interest of justice, this Commission hereby RESOLVES to:
1. GRANT the aforesaid Motion;
2. ADMIT the Petition-in-Intervention filed by Antipolo;
3. REQUIRE the Respondent, ROMEO DUMLAO LONZANIDA, as well as EFREN RACEL ARATEA, proclaimed Vice-Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales, to file their respective Comments on the Petition-in- Intervention within a non-extendible period of five (5) days from receipt thereof;
4. SET the above mentioned Petition-in-Intervention for hearing on January 26, 2011 at 10:00 a.m. COMELEC Session Hall, 8
th
 Floor, Palacio del Gobernador, Intramuros, Manila.
WHEREFORE, furnish copies hereof the parties for their information and compliance.
SO ORDERED.
[17]
In its Resolution dated 2 February 2011, the COMELEC En Banc no longer considered Lonzanida's qualification as an issue: "It is beyond cavil that Lonzanida is not eligible to hold and discharge the functions of the Office of the Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales. The sole issue to be resolved at this juncture is how to fill the vacancy resulting from Lonzanida's disqualification."
[18]
 The Resolution further stated:
We cannot sustain the submission of Oppositor Aratea that Intervenor Aniipolo could never be proclaimed as the duly elected Mayor of Antipolo [sic] for being a second placer in the elections. The teachings in the cases of Codilla vs. De Venecia and Nazareno and Domino vs. COMELEC, et al., while they remain sound jurisprudence find no application in the case at bar. What sets this case apart from the cited jurisprudence is that the notoriety of Lonzanida's disqualification and ineligibility to hold public office is established both in fact and in saw on election day itself. Hence, Lonzanida's name, as already ordered by the Commission on February 18, 2010 should have been stricken off from the list of official candidates for Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales.
WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Commission hereby:
1. Declares NULL and VOID the proclamation of respondent ROMEO D. LONZANIDA;
2. GRANTS the Petition for Intervention of Estela D. Antipolo;
3. Orders the immediate CONSTITUTION of a Special Municipal Board of Canvassers to PROCLAIM Intervenor Estela D. Antipolo as the duly elected Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales;
4. Orders Vice-Mayor Efren Racel Aratea to cease and desist from discharging the functions of the Office of the Mayor, and to cause a peaceful turn-over of the said office to Antipolo upon her proclamation; and
5. Orders the Office of the Executive Director as well as the Regional Election Director of Region HI to cause the implementation of this Resolution and disseminate it to the Department of Interior and Local Government.
SO ORDERED.
[19]
Aratea filed the present petition on 9 February 2011.
The Issues
The manner of filling up the permanent vacancy in the Office of the Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales is dependent upon the determination of Lonzanida's removal. Whether Lonzanida was disqualified under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code, or made a false material representation under Section 78 of the same Code 
that resulted in his certificate of candidacy being void 
ab initio
, is determinative of whether Aratea or Antipolo is The rightful occupant to the Office of the Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales.
The dissenting opinions reverse the COMELEC's 2 February 2011 Resolution and 12 January 2011 Order. They hold that Aratea, the duly elected Vice-Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales, should be declared Mayor pursuant to the Local Government Code's rule on succession.
The dissenting opinions make three grave errors: 
first
, they ignore prevailing jurisprudence that a false representation in the certificate of candidacy as to eligibility in the number of terms elected and served is a material fact that is a ground for a petition to cancel a certificate of candidacy under Section 78; 
second,
 they ignore that a false representation as to eligibility to run for public office due to the fact that the candidate suffers from perpetual 
special disqualification
 is a material fact that is a ground for a petition Lo cancel a certificate of candidacy under Section 78; and 
third
, they resort to a strained statutory construction to conclude that the violation of the three-term limit rule cannot be a ground for cancellation of a certificate of candidacy under Section 78, even when it is clear and plain that violation of the three-term limit rule is an ineligibility affecting the qualification of a candidate to elective office.
The dissenting opinions tread on dangerous ground when they assert that a candidate's eligibility to the office he seeks election must be strictly construed to refer 
only
 to the details, i.e., age, citizenship, or residency, among others, which the law requires him lo slate in his COC, and which he must swear under oath to possess. The dissenting opinions choose to view a false certification of a candidate's eligibility on the three-term limit rule not as a ground for false material representation under Section 78 but as a ground for disqualification under Section 68 of the same Code. This is clearly contrary to well-established jurisprudence.
The Court's Ruling
We hold that Antipolo, the alleged "second placer," should be proclaimed Mayor because Lonzanida's certificate of candidacy was void 
ab initio
. In short, Lonzanida was never a candidate at all. All votes for Lonzanida were stray votes. Thus, Antipolo, the only qualified candidate, actually garnered the highest number of votes for the position of Mayor.
Qualifications and Disqualifications
Section 65 of the Omnibus Election Code points to the Local Government Code for the qualifications of elective local officials. Paragraphs (a) and (c) of Section 39 and Section 40 of the Local Government Code provide in pertinent part:
Sec. 39. 
Qualifications
, (a) An elective local official must be a citizen of the Philippines; a registered voter in the barangay, municipality, city or province x x x; a resident therein for at least one (i) year immediately preceding the day of the election; and able to read and write Filipino or any other local language or dialect.
x x x x
(c) Candidates for the position of mayor or vice-mayor of independent component cities, component cities, or municipalities must be at least. twenty-one (21) years of age on election day.
x x x x.
Sec. 40. 
Disqualifications.
 - The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:
(a) 
Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence
;
(b) Those removed from office as a result of an administrative ease;
(c) Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic;
(d) Those with dual citizenship;
(e) Fugitives from justice in criminal or non-political cases here or abroad;
(f) Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right alter the effectivity of this Code; and
(g) The insane or feeble-minded. (Emphasis supplied)
Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code provides:
Sec. 12. 
Disqualification
. â Any person who has been declared by competent authority insane or incompetent, or has been 
sentenced by final judgment
 for subversion, insurrection, rebellion or 
for any offense for which he was sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude
, shall be disqualified to be a candidate and to hold any office, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty.
The disqualifications to be a candidate herein provided shall be deemed removed upon the declaration by competent authority that said insanity or incompetence had been removed or after the expiration of a period of five years from his service of sentence, unless within the same period lie again becomes disqualified. (Emphasis supplied)
The grounds for disqualification for a petition under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code are specifically enumerated:
Sec. 68. 
Disqualifications.
 - Any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he is a party is declared by final decision by a competent court guilty of, or found by the Commission of having 
(a) given money or other material consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public officials performing electoral functions; (b) committed acts of terrorism to enhance his candidacy; (e) spent in his election campaign an amount in excess of that allowed by this Code; (d) solicited, received or made any contribution prohibited under Sections 89, 95, 96, 97 and 104; (e) violated any of Sections 80, 83, 85, 86 and 261, paragraphs d, e, k, v, and cc, subparagraph 6
, shall be disqualified from continuing as a candidate, or if he has been elected, from holding the office. Any person who is a permanent resident of or an immigrant to a foreign country shall not be qualified to run for any elective office under this Code, unless said person has waived his status as permanent resident or immigrant of a foreign country in accordance with the residence requirement provided for in the election laws. (Emphasis supplied)
A petition for disqualification tinder Section 68 clearly refers to "the commission of prohibited acts and possession of a permanent resident status in a foreign country."
[20]
 
All the offenses mentioned in Section 68 refer to election offenses under the Omnibus Election Code, not to violations of other penal laws. 
There is absolutely nothing in the language of Section 68 that would justify including violation of the three-term limit rule, or conviction by final judgment of the crime of falsification under the Revised Penal Code, as one of the grounds or offenses covered under Section 68.  In 
Codilla, Sr. v. de Venecia
,
[21]
 this Court ruled:
[T|he jurisdiction of the COMELEC to disqualify candidates is limited to those enumerated in Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code. All other election offenses are beyond the ambit of COMELEC jurisdiction. They are criminal and not: administrative in nature, x x x
Clearly, the violation by Lonzanida of the three-term limit rule, or his conviction by final judgment of the crime of falsification under the Revised Penal Code, does not constitute a ground for a petition under Section 68.
False Material Representation
Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code slates that a certificate of candidacy may be denied or cancel led when there is 
false material representation of the contents of the certificate of candidacy
:
Sec. 78. 
Petition to deny due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy.
 â A verified petition seeking to deny due course or to cancel a certificate of candidacy may be filed by the person 
exclusively on the ground that any material representation contained therein as required under Section 74 hereof is false
. The petition may be filed at any time not later than twenty-five, days from the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy and shall he decided, after due notice and hearing, not later than fifteen days before the election. (Emphasis supplied)
Section 74 of the Omnibus Election Code details 
the contents of the certificate of candidacy
:
Sec. 74. 
Contents of certificate of candidacy
. - The certificate of candidacy shall state that the person filing it
 is announcing bis candidacy for the office stated therein and that he is 
eligible for said office
; if for Member of the Batasang Pambansa, the province, including its component cities, highly urbanized city or district or sector which he seeks to represent; the political party to which he belongs; civil status; his date of birth; residence; his post office address for all election purposes; his profession or occupation; that he will support and defend the Constitution of the Philippines and will maintain true faith and allegiance thereto; that he will obey the laws, legal orders, and decrees promulgated by the duly constituted authorities; that he is not a permanent resident or immigrant to a foreign country; that the obligation imposed by his oath is assumed voluntarily, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that the facts stated in the certificate of candidacy are true to the best of his knowledge.
x x x x (Emphasis supplied)
A candidate tor mayor in the 20 5 0 local elections, was thus required to provide 12 items of information in the certificate of candidacy:
[22]
 name; nickname or stage name; gender; age; place of birth; political party that nominated the candidate; civil status; residence/address; profession or occupation; post office address for election purposes; locality of which the candidate is a registered voter; and period of residence in the Philippines before 10 May 2010.  The candidate also certifies four statements: a statement that the candidate is a natural born or naturalized Filipino citizen; a statement that the candidate is not a permanent resident of, or immigrant to, a foreign country; 
a statement that the candidate is eligible for the office he seeks election
; and a statement of the candidate's allegiance to the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines.
[23]
 The certificate of candidacy should also be 
under oath
, and filed within the period prescribed by law.
The conviction of Lonzanida by final judgment, with the penalty of
 prision mayor
, disqualifies him perpetually from holding any public office, or from being elected to any public office. This perpetual disqualification took effect upon the finality of the judgment of conviction, before Lonzanida filed his certificate of candidacy. The pertinent provisions of the Revised Penal Code are as follows:
Art. 27. 
Reclusion perpetua
. â x x x
Prision mayor and temporary disqualification
. â 
The duration of the penalties of 
prision mayor 
and temporary disqualification shall be from six years and one day to twelve years, except when the penalty of disqualification is imposed as an accessory penalty, in which case, it shall be that of the principal penalty.
x x x x
Art. 30. 
Effects of the penalties of perpetual or temporary absolute disqualification
. - The penalties of perpetual or temporary absolute disqualification for public office shall produce the following effects:
1. 
The deprivation of the public offices and employments which the offender may have held, even if conferred by popular election.
2. 
The deprivation of the right to vote in any election for any popular elective office or to be elected to such office.
3. 
The disqualification for the offices or public employments and for the exercise of any of the rights mentioned.
In case of temporary disqualification, such disqualification as is comprised in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this article shall last during the term of the sentence.
4. The loss of all rights to retirement pay or other pension for any office formerly held.
Art. 31. 
Effects of the penalties of perpetual or temporary special disqualification. 
- The penalties of 
perpetual or temporary special disqualification for public office,
 profession or calling shall produce the following effects:
1.
 The deprivation of She office
, employment, profession or calling affected.
2. The disqualification for holding similar offices or employments either perpetually or during the term of the sentence, according to the extent of such disqualification.
Art. 32. 
Effects of the penalties of perpetual or temporary special disqualification for the exercise of the rigid of suffrage.
 â The 
perpetual or temporary special disqualification for the exercise of the right of suffrage shall deprive the offender perpetually or during the term of the sentence,
 according to the nature of said penalty, of the right to vote in any popular election for any public office or
 to be elected to such office. Moreover, the offender shall not be permitted to hold any public office during the period of his disqualification.
Art. 42. 
Prision mayor 
â 
Its accessory penalties
. -- The penalty of prision mayor shall carry with if that of 
temporary absolute disqualification
 and that of perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage which the offender shall suffer although pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon. (Emphasis supplied)
The penalty of 
prision mayor
 automatically carries with it, by operation of law,
[24]
 the accessory penalties of temporary absolute disqualification and 
perpetual special disqualification
. Under Article 30 of the Revised Penal Code, temporary absolute disqualification produces the effect of "deprivation of the right to vote in any election for any popular elective office
 or to be elected to such office
" The duration of temporary absolute disqualification is Use same as that of the principal penalty of prision mayor.  On the other hand, under Article 32 of the Revised Penal Code, 
perpetual special disqualification means that "the offender shall not be permitted to hold any public office dining the period of his disqualification," 
which is perpetually
. Both temporary absolute disqualification and perpetual special disqualification constitute ineligibilities to hold elective public office. 
A person suffering from these ineligibilities is ineligible to run for elective public office, and commits a false material representation if he states in his certificate of candidacy that he is eligible to so run.
In 
Lacuna v. Abes (Lacuna)
,
[25]
 the Court, speaking through Justice J.B.L. Reyes, explained the import of the accessory penalty of 
perpetual special disqualification
:
On the first defense of respondent-appellee Abes, it must be remembered that appellee's conviction of a crime penalized with prision mayor which carried the accessory penalties of temporary absolute disqualification and perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage (Article 42, Revised Penal Code); and Section 99 of the Revised Election Code disqualifies a person from voting if he had been sentenced by final judgment to suffer one year or more of imprisonment.
The accessory penalty of temporary absolute disqualification disqualifies the convict for public office and for the right to vote, such disqualification to last only during the term of the sentence (Article 27, paragraph 3, & Article 30, Revised Penal Code) that, in the case of Abes, would have expired on 13 October 1961.
But this does not hold true with respect to the other accessory penalty of perpetual special disqualification for the exercise of the right of suffrage. This accessory penalty deprives the convict of the right to vote 
or to be elected to or hold public office perpetually
, as distinguished from temporary special disqualification, which lasts during the term of the sentence.
 Article 32, Revised Penal Code, provides:
Art. 32- 
Effects of the penalties of perpetual or temporary special disqualification for the exercise of the right of suffrage.
 â The perpetual or temporary special disqualification for the exercise of the right of suffrage shall deprive the offender perpetually or during the term of the sentence, according to the nature of said penalty, of the right to vote in any popular election for any public office or to be elected to such office. Moreover, the offender shall not be permitted to hold any public office during the period of disqualification.
The word "perpetually" and the phrase "during the term of the sentence" should be applied distributively to their respective antecedents; thus, the word "perpetually" refers lo the perpetual kind of special disqualification, while the phrase "during the term of the sentence" refers to the temporary special disqualification. The duration between the perpetual and the temporary (both special) are necessarily different because the provision, instead of merging (heir durations into one period, slates that such duration is "according to the nature of said penalty" â which means according to whether the penalty is the perpetual or the temporary special disqualification. (Emphasis supplied)
Clearly, 
Lacuna
 instructs that the accessory penalty of perpetual special disqualification "
deprives the convict of the right to vote 
or to be elected to or hold public office perpetually
."
The accessory penalty of perpetual special disqualification takes effect immediately once the judgment of conviction becomes final
. The effectivity of this accessory penalty does not depend on the duration of the principal penalty, or on whether the convict serves his jail sentence or not. The last sentence of Article 32 states that "the offender shall not be permitted to hold any public office during the period of his [perpetual special] disqualification." Once the judgment of conviction becomes final, it is immediately executory. Any public office that the convict may be holding at the time of his conviction becomes vacant upon finality of the judgment, and 
the convict becomes ineligible to run for any elective public office perpetually.
 In the case of Lonzanida, he became ineligible perpetually to hold, or to run for, any elective public office front the time the judgment of conviction against hint became final.  The judgment of conviction was promulgated on 20 July 2009 and became final on 23 October 2009, before Lonzanida filed his certificate of candidacy on 1 December 2009
.
[26]
Perpetual special disqualification
 is a ground for a petition under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code because this accessory penalty is an 
ineligibility
, which means that the convict is not eligible to run for public office, contrary to the statement that Section 74 requires him to state under oath in his certificate of candidacy. As this Court held in 
Fermin v. Commission on Elections
,
[21]
 the false material representation may refer to "
qualifications or eligibility
." One who suffers from perpetual special disqualification is ineligible to run for public office. If a person suffering from perpetual special disqualification files a certificate of candidacy stating under oath that "he is eligible to run for (public) office," 
as expressly required under Section 74
, then he clearly makes a 
false material representation
 that is a ground for a petition under Section 78. As this Court explained in 
Fermin
:
Lest it be misunderstood, the denial of due course to or the cancellation of the CoC is not based on the lack of qualifications but on a finding that the candidate made a material representation that is false, 
which may relate to the qualifications required of the public office he/ she is running for. It is noted that the candidate states in his/her CoC that he/she is eligible for the office he/she seeks. Section 78 of the OEC, therefore, is to be read in relation to the constitutional and statutory provisions on 
qualifications or eligibility
 for public office. If the candidate subsequently states a material representation in the CoC that is false, the COMELEC, following the law, is empowered to deny due course to or cancel such certificate
. Indeed, the Court has already likened a proceeding under Section 78 to a quo warranto proceeding under Section 253 of the OEC since they both deal with the eligibility or qualification of a candidate, with the distinction mainly in the fact that a "Section 78" petition is filed before proclamation, while a petition for quo warranto is filed after proclamation of the winning candidate.
[28]
 (Emphasis supplied)
Latasa, Rivera and Ong:
The Three-Term Limit Rule as a Ground for Ineligibility
Section 74 requires the candidate to certify that he 
is eligible for the public office
 he seeks election. Thus, Section 74 states that 
"the certificate of candidacy shall state that the person filing x x x is eligible for said office.
" The three-term limit rule, enacted to prevent the establishment of political dynasties and to enhance the electorate's freedom of choice,
[29]
 is found both in the Constitution
[30]
 and the law.
[31]
 After being elected and serving for three consecutive terms, an elective local official cannot seek immediate reelection for the same office in the next regular election
[32]
 because he is 
ineligible
.  One who has an ineligibility to run for elective public office is not "eligible for [the] office."  As used in Section 74, the word "eligible"
[33]
 means having the right to run for elective public office, that is, having all the qualifications and none of the ineligibilities to run for the public office.
In 
Latasa v. Commission on Elections
,
[34]
 petitioner Arsenio Latasa was elected mayor of the Municipality of Digos, Davao del Sur in 1992, 1995, and 1998. The Municipality of Digos was converted into the City of Digos during Latasa's third term. Latasa filed his certificate of candidacy for city mayor for the 2001 elections. Romeo Sunga, Latasa's opponent, filed before the COMELEC a "petition to deny due course, cancel certificate of candidacy and/or disqualification" under Section 78 on the ground that Latasa falsely represented in his certificate of candidacy that he is eligible to run as mayor of Digos City. Latasa argued that he did not make any false representation. In his certificate of candidacy, Latasa inserted a footnote after the phrase "I am eligible" and indicated "*Having served three (3) term[s| as municipal mayor and now running for the first time as city mayor." The COMELEC First Division cancelled Latasa's certificate of candidacy for violation of the three-term limit rule but not for false material representation. This Court affirmed the COMELEC En Banc's denial of Latasa's motion for reconsideration.
We cancelled Marino Morales' certificate of candidacy in 
Rivera III v. Commission on Elections (Rivera).
[35]
 We held that Morales exceeded the maximum three-term limit, having been elected and served as Mayor of Mabalacat for four consecutive terms (1995 to 1998, 1998 to 2001, 2001 to 2004, and 2004 to 2007). We declared him ineligible as a candidate for the same position for the 2007 to 2010 term. Although we did not explicitly rule that Morales' violation of the three-term limit rule constituted false material representation, we nonetheless granted the petition to cancel Morales' certificate of candidacy under Section 78. We also affirmed the cancellation of Francis Ong's certificate of candidacy in 
Ong v. Alegre
,
[36]
 where the "petition to disqualify, deny due course and cancel" Ong's certificate of candidacy under Section 78 was predicated on the violation of the three-term limit rule.
Loong, Fermin and Munder:
When Possession of a Disqualifying Condition
is Not a Ground for a Petition for Disqualification
It is obvious from a reading of the laws and jurisprudence that there is an overlap in the grounds for eligibility and ineligibility 
vis-a-vis
 qualifications and disqualifications. For example, a candidate may represent that he is a resident of a particular Philippine locality
[37]
 when he is actually a permanent resident of another country.
[38]
 In cases of such overlap, the petitioner should not be constrained in his choice of remedy when the Omnibus Election Code explicitly makes available multiple remedies.
[39]
 Section 78 allows the filing of a petition to deny due course or to cancel a certificate of candidacy before the election, while Section 253 allows the filing of a petition for quo warranto after the election. Despite the overlap of the grounds, one should not confuse a petition for disqualification using grounds enumerated in Section 68 with a petition to deny due course or to cancel a certificate of candidacy under Section 78.
The distinction between a petition under Section 68 and a petition under Section 78 was discussed in 
Loong v. Commission on Elections
[40]
 with respect to the applicable prescriptive period.  Respondent Nur Hussein Ututalum filed a petition under Section 78 to disqualify petitioner Benjamin Loong for the office of Regional Vice-Governor of the Autonomous Government of Muslim Mindanao for false representation as to his age.  The petition was filed 16 days after the election, and clearly beyond the prescribed 25 day period from the last day of filing certificates of candidacy.   This Court ruled that Ututalum's petition was one based on false representation under Section 78, and not for disqualification under Section 68.  Hence, the 25-day prescriptive period provided in Section 78 should be strictly applied. We recognized the possible gap in the law:
It is true that the discovery of false representation as to material facts required to he stated in a certificate of candidacy, under Section 74 of the Code, may be made only after the lapse of the 25-day period prescribed by Section 78 of the Code, through no fault of the person who discovers such misrepresentations and who would want the disqualification of the candidate committing the misrepresentations. It would seem, therefore, that there could indeed be a gap between the time of the discovery of the misrepresentation, (when the discovery is made after the 25-day period under Sec. 78 of the Code has lapsed) and the time when the proclamation of the results of the election is made. During this so-called "gap" the would-be petitioner (who would seek the disqualification of the candidate) is left with nothing to do except to wait for the proclamation of the results, so that he could avail of a remedy against the misrepresenting candidate, that is, by filing a petition for quo warranto against him. Respondent Commission sees this "gap" in what it calls a procedural gap which, according to it, is unnecessary and should be remedied.
At the same time, it can not be denied that it is the purpose and intent of the legislative branch of the government to fix a definite time within which petitions of protests related to eligibility of candidates for elective offices must be filed, as seen in Sections 78 and 253 of the Code. Respondent Commission may have seen the need to remedy this so-called "procedural gap", but it is not for it to prescribe what the law does not provide, its function not being legislative. The question of whether the time to file these petitions or protests is too short or ineffective is one for the Legislature to decide and remedy.
[41]
In 
Vermin v. Commission on Elections
[42]
 the issue of a candidate's possession of the required one-year residency requirement was raised in a petition for disqualification under Section 68 instead of a petition to deny due course or to cancel a certificate of candidacy under Section 78. Despite the question of (he one-year residency being a proper ground under Section 78, Dilangalen, the petitioner before the COMELEC in 
Fermin
, relied on Section 5(C)(1) and 5(C)(3)(a)(4) of COMELEC Resolution No. 7800
[43]
 and filed the petition under Section 68.  In 
Fermin
, we ruled that "a COMELEC rule or resolution cannot supplant or vary legislative enactments that 
distinguish the grounds for disqualification from those of in eligibility
, and the appropriate proceedings to raise the said grounds."
[44]
 A petition for disqualification can only be premised on a ground specified in Section 12 or 68 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the Local Government Code. Thus, a petition questioning a candidate's possession of the required one-year residency requirement, as distinguished from permanent residency or immigrant status in a foreign country, should be Hied under Section 78, and a petition under Section 68 is the wrong remedy.
In 
Munder v. Commission on Elections
[45]
 petitioner Alfais Munder filed a certificate of candidacy for Mayor of Bubong, Lanao del Sur on 26 November 2009. Respondent Atty. Tago Sarip filed a petition for Munder's disqualification on 13 April 2010.  Sarip claimed that Munder misrepresented that he was a registered voter of Bubong, Lanao del Sur, and that he was eligible to register as a voter in 2003 even though he was not yet 18 years of age at the time of the voter's registration. Moreover, Munder's certificate of candidacy was not accomplished in full as he failed to indicate his precinct and did not affix his thumb-mark. The COMELEC Second Division dismissed Sarip's petition and declared that his grounds are not grounds Tor disqualification under Section 68 but for denial or cancellation of Munder's certificate of candidacy under Section 78.  Sarip's petition was filed out of time as he had only 25 days after the filing of Munder's certificate of candidacy, or until 21 December 2009, within which to file his petition.
The COMELEC En Banc, however, disqualified Munder. In reversing the COMELEC Second Division, the COMELEC En Banc did not rule on the propriety of Sarip's remedy but focused on the question of whether Munder was a registered voter of Bubong, Lanao del Sur. This Court reinstated the COMELEC Second Division's resolution. This Court ruled that the ground raised in the petition, lack of registration as voter in the locality where he was running as a candidate, is inappropriate for a petition for disqualification. We further declared that with our ruling in 
Fermin
, we had already rejected the claim that lack of substantive qualifications of a candidate is a ground for a petition for disqualification under Section 68. The only substantive qualification the absence of which is a ground for a petition under Section 68 is the candidate's permanent residency or immigrant status in a foreign country.
The dissenting opinions place the violation of the three-term limit rule as a disqualification under Section 68 as the violation allegedly is "a status, circumstance or condition which bars him from running for public office despite the possession of all the qualifications under Section 39 of the [Local Government Code]." In so holding the dissenting opinions write in the law what is not found in the law. Section 68 is explicit as to the proper grounds for disqualification under said Section. The grounds for filing a petition for disqualification under Section 68 are specifically enumerated in said Section. However, contrary to the specific enumeration in Section 68 and contrary to prevailing jurisprudence, the dissenting opinions add to the enumerated grounds the violation of the three-term limit rule and falsification under the Revised Penal Code, which are obviously not found in the enumeration in Section 68.
The dissenting opinions equate Lonzanida's possession of a disqualifying condition (violation of the three-term limit rule) with the grounds for disqualification under Section 68. Section 68 is explicit as to the proper grounds for disqualification: the commission of specific prohibited acts under the Omnibus Election Code and possession of a permanent residency or immigrant status in a foreign country. Any other false representation regarding a material fact should be filed under Section 78, specifically under the candidate's certification of his eligibility. In rejecting a violation of the three-term limit as a condition for eligibility, the dissenting opinions resort to judicial legislation, ignoring the 
verba legis
 doctrine and well-established jurisprudence on this very issue.
In a certificate of candidacy, the candidate is asked to certify under oath his eligibility, and thus qualification, to the office he seeks election. Even though the certificate of candidacy does not specifically ask. the candidate for the number of terms elected and served in an elective position, such fact is material in determining a candidate's eligibility, and thus qualification for the office. Election to and service of the same local elective position for three consecutive terms renders a candidate ineligible from running for the same position in the succeeding elections. Lonzanida misrepresented his eligibility because he knew full well that he had been elected, and had served, as mayor of San Antonio, Zambales for more than three consecutive terms yet he still certified that he was eligible to run for mayor for the next succeeding term. Thus, Lonzanida's representation that he was eligible for the office that he sought election constitutes false material representation as to his qualification or eligibility for the office.
Legal Duty of COMELEC
to Enforce Perpetual Special Disqualification
Even without a petition under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, the COMELEC is under a legal duty to cancel the certificate of candidacy of anyone suffering from perpetual special disqualification to run for public office by virtue of a final judgment of conviction. The final judgment of conviction is judicial notice to the COMELEC of the disqualification of the convict from running for public office. The law itself bars the convict from running for public office, and the disqualification is part of the final judgment of conviction. The final judgment of the court is addressed not only to the Executive branch, but also to other government agencies tasked to implement the final judgment under the law.
Whether or not the COMELEC is expressly mentioned in the judgment to implement the disqualification, it is assumed that the portion of the final judgment on disqualification to run for elective public office is addressed to the COMELEC because under the Constitution the COMELEC is duty bound to "
enforce
 and administer 
all
 laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election."
[46]
 The disqualification of a convict to run for elective public office under the Revised Penal Code, as affirmed by final judgment of a competent court, is part of the 
enforcement and administration
 of "all the laws" relating to the conduct of elections.
Effect of a Void Certificate of Candidacy
A cancelled certificate of candidacy void 
ab initio
 cannot give rise to a valid candidacy, and much less to valid votes.
[47]
 We quote from the COMELEC's 2 February 2011 Resolution with approval:
As early as February 18, 2010, the Commission speaking through the Second Division had already ordered the cancellation of Lonzanida's certificate of candidacy, and had stricken off his name in the list of official candidates for the mayoralty post of San Antonio, Zambales. Thereafter, the Commission En Bane in its resolution dated August 11, 2010 unanimously affirmed the resolution disqualifying Lonzanida. Our findings were likewise sustained by the Supreme Court no less. The disqualification of Lonzanida is not simply anchored on one ground. On the contrary, ii was emphasized in our En Banc resolution that Lonzanida's disqualification is two-pronged: 
first
, he violated the constitutional fiat on the three-term limit; and 
second
, as early as December 1, 2009, he is known to have been convicted by final judgment for ten (10) counts of Falsification under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code. In other words, on election day, respondent Lonzanida's disqualification is notoriously known in fact and in law.
 Ergo, since respondent Lonzanida was 
never a candidate
 for the position of Mayor [of] San Antonio, Zambales, the votes cast for him should he considered stray votes
. Consequently, Intervenor Antipolo, who remains as the sole qualified candidate for the mayoralty post and obtained the highest number of votes, should now be proclaimed as the duly elected Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales. (Boldfacing and underscoring in the original; italicization supplied).
Lonzanida's certificate of candidacy was cancelled because he was ineligible or not qualified to run for Mayor. Whether his certificate of candidacy is cancelled before or after the elections is immaterial because the cancellation on such ground means he was never a candidate from the very beginning, his certificate of candidacy being void 
ab initio
. There was only one qualified candidate for Mayor in the May 2010 elections â Antipolo, who therefore received the highest number of votes.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DISMISSED
.  The Resolution dated 2 February 2011 and the Order dated 12 January 2011 of the COMELEC En Banc in SPA No, 09-1 58 (DC) are 
AFFIRMED
. The COMELEC En Banc is 
DIRECTED
 to constitute a Special Municipal Board of Canvassers to proclaim Estela D. Antipolo as the duly elected Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales. Petitioner Efren Racel Afatea is 
ORDERED
 to cease and desist from discharging the functions of the Office of the Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales.

DISSENTING OPINION
BRION, 
J
.:
I dissent from the majority's (i) ruling that the violation of the 
three-term limit rule is a ground for cancellation or a certificate of 
candidacy 
(CoC)
 and (ii) conclusion that private respondent 
Estela D. Antipolo, the "second placer" in the 2010 elections for the 
mayoralty post in San Antonio, Zambales, should be seated as Mayor.



Romeo
 D. Lonzanida and Antipolo were among the four (4) candidates for the 
mayoralty position in San Antonio, Zambales in the May 10, 2010 
elections.  On December 8, 2009, Dr. Sigfrid S. Rodolfo filed a 
Petition to Disqualify/Deny Due Course or to Cancel CoC
 against Lonzanida with the Commission on Elections 
(COMELEC)
.
 The core of the petition against Lonzanida was his purported 
misrepresentation in his CoC by slating that he was eligible to run as 
mayor of San Antonio, Zambales, when in fact, he had already served for 
three consecutive terms.
[1]



On February 18, 2010, the COMELEC 2
nd
 Division issued a Resolution 
cancelling Lonzanida's CoC and striking out his name from the official list of candidates for mayor
 on the ground that he had already served for three consecutive terms.
[2]



Lonzanida moved for the reconsideration of the ruling, which motion under the Rules of the COMELEC was elevated to the COMELEC 
en banc
. 
 The motion was not resolved before elections and on May 10, 2010, 
Lonzanida received the highest number of votes for the mayoralty post, 
while petitioner Efren Racel Aratea won the vice mayoralty position; 
they were duly proclaimed winners.
[3]



Due to the COMELEC Resolution canceling Lonzanida's CoC, Aratea wrote to the Department of the Interior arid Local Government 
(DILG)
 to inquire whether, by law, he should assume the position of mayor, in view of the permanent vacancy created by the COMELEC 2
nd

 Division's ruling.  The DILG favorably acted on Aratea's request, and 
on July 5, 2010, he took his oath of office as mayor of San Antonio, 
Zambales.
[4]



On August 11, 2010, the COMELEC 
en banc
 affirmed Lonzanida's disqualification to run for another term. Apart from this ground, the COMELEC 
en banc

 also noted that Lonzanida was disqualified to run under Section 40 of 
the Local Government Code for having been convicted by final judgment 
for ten counts of falsification.
[5]



On
 August 25, 2010, Antipolo filed a motion for leave to intervene, on the
 claim that she had a legal interest in the case as she was the only 
remaining qualified candidate for the position. She argued that she had 
the right to be proclaimed as the mayor considering that Lonzanida 
ceased to be a candidate when the COMELEC 2
nd
 Division 
ordered the cancellation of his CoC and the striking out of his name 
from the official list of candidates for the May 10, 2010 elections.
[6]



On January 12, 2011, the COMELEC 
en banc
 issued an Order granting Antipolo's motion for leave to intervene.  In its February 2, 2012 Resolution, the COMELEC 
en banc

 granted Antipolo's petition in intervention; declared null and void 
Lonzanida's proclamation; ordered the constitution of a special 
Municipal Board of Canvassers to proclaim Antipolo as the duly elected 
Mayor; and ordered Aratea to cease and desist from discharging the 
functions of Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales.  This gave rise to the 
present petition.




The Issues



The issues for the Court's resolution are as follows:




(1) What is the nature of the petition filed by Dr. Rodolfo before the COMELEC;
(2) Did the COMELEC correctly dispose the case in accordance with the nature of the petition filed;
(3) Who should be proclaimed as Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales - the "second placer" or the duly elected Vice-Mayor?



I
 submit that the violation of the three-term limit rule cannot be a 
ground for the cancellation of a CoC.  It is an appropriate ground for 
disqualification; thus, Dr. Rodolfo should be deemed to have filed a 
petition for disqualification, not a petition for the cancellation of 
Lonzanida's CoC. The COMELEC's cancellation of Lonzarnda's CoC was 
therefore erroneous.



I reach this conclusion by using an approach
 that starts from a consideration of the nature of the CoC - the 
document that creates the status of a candidate - and moves on to 
relevant concepts, specifically, disqualifications and 'tis effects, 
remedies, effects of successful suits, and ultimately the three-term 
limit rule. I discussed this fully at length in the case of 
Talaga v. COMELEC.
[7]
 hereby reiterate my 
Talaga
 discussions for ease of presentation.




The CoC and the Qualifications
for its Filling.



A
 basic rule and one that cannot be repeated often enough is that the CoC
 is the document that creates the. status of a candidate. In 
Sinaca v. Mula
,
[6]
 the Court described the nature of a CoC as follows -




A
 certificate of candidacy is in the nature of a formal manifestation to 
the whole world of the candidate's political creed or lack of political 
creed. It is a statement of a person seeking to run for a public office 
certifying that he announces his candidacy for She office mentioned and 
that he is eligible for the office, the name of the political party to 
which he belongs, if he belongs to any, and his post-office address for 
all election purposes being as well staled.



Both the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions left to Congress the task of providing the qualifications of 
local elective officiate
. Congress undertook this task by enacting Batas Pambasa Bilang 
(B.P. Blg
.) 337 (
Local Government Code or LGC
), B.P. Blg. 881 
(Omnibus Election Code or OEC)
 and, later, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7160 
(Local Government Code of 1991 or LGC 1991).
[9]



Under Section 79 of the OEC, a political aspirant legally becomes a "candidate" only upon the due filing of his sworn CoC.
[10]
 In fact, Section 73 of the OEC makes the filing of the CoC a condition 
sine qua non
 for a person to "be eligible for any elective public office"
[11]
 
 â i.e., to be validly voted for in the elections. Section 76 of the OEC
 makes it a "ministerial duty" for a COMELEC official "to receive and 
acknowledge receipt of the certificate of candidacy"
[12]
 filed.




COMELEC
 Resolution No. 8678 provides what a CoC must contain or state:
[13]




Section 2. 
Contents of certificate of candidacy
.
 - The certificate of candidacy shall be under oath and shall state that
 the person filing it is announcing his candidacy for the office and 
constituency stated therein; that he is eligible for said office, his 
age, sex, civil status, place and date of birth, his citizenship, 
whether natural-born or naturalized; the registered political party to 
which he belongs; if married, the full name of the spouse; his legal 
residence, giving the exact address, the precinct number, barangay, city
 or municipality and province where he is registered voter; his post 
office address for election purposes; his profession or occupation or 
employment; that he is not a permanent resident or an immigrant to a 
foreign country; that he will support and defend the Constitution of the
 Republic of the Philippines and will maintain true faith and allegiance
 thereto; that he will obey the laws, legal orders, decrees, resolution,
 rules and regulations promulgated and issued by the duly-constituted 
authorities; that he assumes the foregoing obligations voluntarily 
without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that the facts 
stated in the certificate are true and correct to the best of his own 
knowledge, [italics supplied]



From the point of view of 
the common citizen who wants to run for a local elective office, the 
above recital contains all the requirements that he must satisfy; it 
contains.the basic and essential requirements applicable 
to all citizens to qualify for candidacy
 for a local elective office. These are their formal terms of entry to local politics. A citizen must not only 
possess

 all these requirements; he must positively represent in his CoC that he
 possesses them. Any falsity on these requirements constitutes a 
material misrepresentation that can lead to the cancellation of the, 
CoC. On this point, Section 78 of the OEC provides:




Sec. 78. 
Petition to deny due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy.

 - A verified petition seeking to deny due course or to cancel a 
certificate of candidacy may be filed by [any 1 person exclusively on 
the ground that any 
material representation contained therein as required under Section 74

 hereof is false. The petition "may be filed at any time not later than 
twenty-five days from the time of the filing of the certificate of 
candidacy and shall be decided, after due notice and hearing, not later 
than fifteen days before the election, [italics, emphases and 
underscores ours]



A necessarily related provision is Section 39 of LGC 1991 which states:




Sec. 39. 
Qualifications, 
â (a) An elective local official must be a citizen of the Philippines; a registered-voter in the 
barangay
, municipality, city, or province or, in the case of a member of the 
sangguniang panlalawigan, sangguniang panlungsod,
 or 
sanggunian bayan
,
 the district where he intends to be elected; a resident therein for at 
least one (1) year immediately preceding the clay of the election; and 
able to read and write Filipino or any other local language or dialect.
x x x x
(c)
 Candidates for the position of Mayor or vice-mayor of independent 
component cities, component cities, or municipalities must be at least 
twenty-one (21) years of age on election day.  [italics ours]



Notably,
 Section 74 of the OEC does not require any negative qualification 
except only as expressly required therein. A specific negative 
requirement refers to the representation that.the would-be candidate is 
not

 a permanent resident nor an immigrant in another country. This 
requirement, however, is in fact simply part of the positive requirement
 of residency in the locality for which the CoC is filed and, in this 
sense, is not strictly a negative requirement. 
Neither does Section 74 require any statement that the would-be candidate 
does not possess

 any ground for disqualification specifically enumerated by law, as 
disqualification is a matter that the OEC and LGC 1991 separately deal 
with, as discussed below. Notably, Section 74 does not 
require
 a would-be candidate to state that he has 
not
 served for three consecutive terms in the same elective position immediately prior to the present elections.



With
 the accomplishment of the CoC .and its filing, a political aspirant 
officially acquires the status of a candidate and, at the very least, 
the prospect of holding public office; he, too, formally opens himself 
up to the complex political environment: and processes. The Court cannot
 be more emphatic in holding "that 
the importance of a valid certificate of candidacy rests at the very core of the electoral process
."
[14]



Pertinent laws
[15]

 provide the specific periods when a CoC may be filed; when a petition 
for its cancellation may be brought; and the effect of its filing. These
 measures, among others, are in line with the State policy or objective 
of ensuring "equal access to opportunities for public service,"
[16]

 bearing in mind that the limitations on the privilege to seek public 
office are within the plenary power of Congress to provide.
[17]




The Concept of Disqualification  vis-a-vis 
Remedy of Cancellation; and Effects of 
Disqualification.



To
 disqualify, in its simplest sense, is (1) to deprive a person of a 
power, right or privilege; or (2) to make him or her ineligible for 
further competition because of violation of the rules.
[18]
 It is in these senses that the term is understood in our election laws.



Thus,
 anyone who may qualify or may have qualified under the general rules of
 eligibility applicable to all citizens (Section 74 of the OEC) may be 
deprived of the right to be a candidate air may lose the right to be a candidate
 (if he has filed his CoC) because of a trait or characteristic that applies to him or an act that can be imputed to him 
as an individual, separately from the general qualifications that must exist for a citizen to run for a local public office.
 Notably, 
the breach of the three-term limit 
is a trait or condition that can possibly apply 
only

 to those who have previously served for three consecutive terms in the 
same position sought immediately prior to the present elections.



In
 a disqualification situation, the grounds are the individual traits or 
conditions of, or the individual acts of disqualification committed by, a
 candidate as provided under Sections 68 and 12 of the OEC and Section 
40 of LGC 1991, and which generally have nothing to do with the 
eligibility requirements for the filing of a CoC.
[19]



Sections
 68 and 12 of the OEC (together with Section 40 of LGC 1991, outlined 
below) cover the following as traits, characteristics or acts of 
disqualification: (i) corrupting voters or election officials; (ii) 
committing acts of terrorism to enhance candidacy; (iii) overspending; 
(iv) soliciting, receiving or making prohibited contributions; (v) 
campaigning outside the campaign period; (vi) removal, destruction or 
defacement of lawful election propaganda; (vii) committing prohibited 
forms of election propaganda; (viii) violating rules and regulations on 
election propaganda, through mass media; (ix) coercion of subordinates; 
(x) threats, intimidation, terrorism, use of fraudulent device or other 
forms of coercion; (xi) unlawful electioneering; (xii) release, 
disbursement or expenditure of public funds; (xiii) solicitation of 
votes or undertaking any propaganda on the day of the election; (xiv) 
declaration as an insane; and (xv) committing subversion, insurrection, 
rebellion or any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of
 more than eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude.



Section 40 of LGC 1991, on the other hand, essentially repeats those already in the OEC under the following disqualifications:




Those
 sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or
 for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, 
within ivvo (2) years after serving sentence;
 Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case;
Those  convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic;
 These with dual citizenship;
Fugitives from justice in criminal or non-political cases here or abroad;
Permanent
 residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to 
reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after She 
effectivity of this Code; and
The insane or feeble-minded.



Together,
 these provisions embody the disqualifications that, by statute, can be 
imputed against a candidate or a local elected official to deny him of 
the chance to run for office or of the chance to serve if he has been 
elected.



A unique feature of "disqualification" is that under Section 68 of the OEC,
 it refers only to a "candidate
,"
 not to one who is not yet a candidate.  Thus, the grounds for 
disqualification do not apply to a would-be candidate who is still at 
the point of filing his CoC. 
This is the reason why no representation
 is required in the CoC that the would be candidate does not possess any
 ground for disqualification. The time to hold a person accountable for 
the grounds for disqualification is after attaining the status of a 
candidate, with the filing of the CoC.



To sum up and 
reiterate the essential differences between the eligibility requirements
 and disqualifications, the former are the requirements that apply to, 
and must be complied by, all citizens who wish to run for local elective
 office; these must be positively asserted in the CoC. The latter refer 
to individual traits, conditions or acts applicable to specific 
individuals that serve as grounds against one who has qualified as a 
candidate to lose this status or privilege; essentially, they have 
nothing to do with a candidate's CoC.



When the law allows the 
cancellation of a candidate's CoC
, the law considers the cancellation 
from the point of view of those positive requirements that every citizen who wishes to run for office must commonly satisfy.
 Since the elements of "eligibility" are common, the vice of ineligibility attaches to and affects both the candidate 
and

 his CoC. In contrast, when the law allows the disqualification of a 
candidate, the law looks only at the disqualifying trait or condition 
specific to the individual; if the "eligibility" requirements have been 
satisfied, the disqualification applies only to the person of the 
candidate, leaving the CoC valid. A previous conviction of subversion is
 the best example as it applies not to the citizenry at large, but only 
to the convicted individuals; a convict may have a valid CoC upon 
satisfying the eligibility requirements under Section 74 of the OEC, but
 shall nevertheless be disqualified.



While the violation of the 
three-term rule is properly a ground for disqualification, it is a 
unique ground, constitutionally anchored at that, that sets it apart 
from and creates a distinction even from the ordinary grounds of 
disqualification. The succeeding discussions, incorporate these 
intra-disqualification distinctions on the grounds for disqualification,
 which in sum refer to (i) the period to file a petition and (ii) 
capability of substitution and (iii) on the application of the doctrine 
of rejection of second placer and the doctrine's exceptions.




Distinctions among (i) denying due course to or
cancellation of a CoC, (ii) disqualification, and 
(iii) quo warranto



The
 nature of the eligibility requirements for a local elective office and 
the disqualifications that may apply to candidates necessarily create 
distinctions on the 
remedies available
, on the 
effects of lack of eligibility and disqualification
.  The remedies available are essentially:  the 
cancellation of a CoC, disqualification from candidacy or from holding office
, and 
quo warranto
,
 which are distinct remedies with varying applicability and effects. For
 ease of presentation and understanding, their availability, grounds and
 effects are topically discussed below.




As to the grounds.



In the 
denial of due course to or cancellation of a CoC
,
 the ground is essentially lack of eligibility under the pertinent 
constitutional and statutory provisions on qualifications or eligibility
 for public office;
[20]
 the governing provisions are 
Sections 78 and 69 of the OEC
.
[21]



In a 
disqualification case
, as mentioned above, the grounds are traits, conditions, characteristics or acts of disqualification,
[22]

 individually applicable to a candidate, as provided under Sections 68 
and 12 of B.P. Blg. 881; Section 40 of LGC 1991; and, as discussed 
below, Section 8, Article X of the Constitution. As previously 
discussed, the grounds for disqualification are different from, and have
 nothing to do with, a candidate's CoC although they may result in 
disqualification from candidacy whose immediate effect 
upon finality before the elections

 is the same as a cancellation. If they are cited in a petition filed 
before the elections, they remain as disqualification grounds and carry 
effects that, are distinctly peculiar to disqualification.



In a 
quo warranto
 petition
,
 the grounds to oust an elected official from his office are 
ineligibility and disloyalty to the Republic of the Philippines. This is
 provided under Section 253 of the OEC and governed by the Rules of 
Court as to procedures. While 
quo warranto
 and cancellation share the same ineligibility grounds, 
they differ as to the time these grounds are cited
. A cancellation case is brought before the elections, while 
a quo warranto
 is filed after and may still be filed even if a CoC cancellation case was not filed before elections.




The
 only difference between the two proceedings is that, under section 78, 
the qualifications for elective office are misrepresented in the 
certificate of candidacy and the proceedings must be initiated before 
the elections, whereas a petition for 
quo warranto
 under section 
253 may be brought on the basis of two grounds - (1) ineligibility or 
(2) disloyalty lo the Republic of the Philippines, and must be initiated
 within ten days after the proclamation of the election results. Under 
section 253, a candidate is ineligible if he is disqualified to be 
elected to office, and he is disqualified if he lacks any of the 
qualifications for elective office.
[23]



Note that the question of what would constitute 
acts of disqualification

 - under Sections 68 and 12 of the OEC and Section 40 of LGC 1991 - is 
best resolved by directly referring to the provisions involved.  On the 
other hand, what constitutes a violation of the three-term limit rule 
under the Constitution has been clarified in our case law.
[24]
 The approach is not as straight forward in a petition to 
deny due course to or cancel a CoC
 and also to 
a q
uo warranto
 petition
, which similarly covers the ineligibility of a candidate/elected official. In 
Salcedo II v. COMELEC
,
[25]
 we ruled that â




[I]n order to justify the cancellation of the certificate of candidacy under Section 78, it is essential that the 
false representation 
mentioned therein pertain to a 
material matter

 for the sanction imposed by his provision would affect the substantive 
rights of a candidate â the right to run for the elective post for which
 he filed the certificate of candidacy.  Although the law does not 
specify what would be considered as a "material representation," the 
Court has interpreted this phrase in a line of decisions applying 
Section 78 of the Code.
x x x x
Therefore, it may be concluded that the material misrepresentation contemplated by Section 78 of the Code refer to 
qualifications for elective office
.
 This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the consequences 
imposed upon a candidate guilty of having made a false representation in
 his certificate of candidacy are grave â to prevent the candidate from 
running or, if elected, from serving, or to prosecute him for violation 
of the election laws. It could not have been the intention of the law to
 deprive a person of such a basic and substantive political right to be 
voted for a public office upon just any innocuous mistake, [emphases 
ours, citation omitted]



Thus, in addition to the failure
 to satisfy or comply with the eligibility requirements, a material 
misrepresentation must be present in a cancellation of CoC situation. 
The law apparently does not allow material divergence from the listed 
requirements to qualify for candidacy and enforces its edict by 
requiring positive representation of complianee under oath. 
Significantly, where disqualification is involved, the mere existence of
 a ground appears sufficient and a material representation assumes no 
relevance.




As to the period for filing:



The period to file a 
petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC
 depends on the provision of law invoked.  If the petition is filed under 
Section 78 of the OEC
, the petition must be filed within twenty-five (25) days from the filing of the CoC. However, it the petition is brought under 
Section 69
 of the same law, the petition must be filed within five (5) days from the last day of filing the CoC.
[27]



On the other hand, the period to file a 
disqualification
 case is at any time before the proclamation of a winning candidate, as provided in COMELEC Resolution No. 8696.
[28]
  
The
 three-term limit disqualification, because of its unique 
characteristics, does not strictly follow this time limitation and is 
discussed at length below
. At the very least, it should follow the temporal limitations of a 
quo warranto
 petition
 which must be filed within ten (10) days front proclamation.
[29]
  The constitutional nature of the violation, however, argues against the application of this time requirement; the 
rationale

 for the rule and the role of the Constitution in the country's legal 
order dictate that a petition should be allowed while a consecutive 
fourth-termer is in office. 




As to the effects of a successful suit.



A candidate whose CoC was 
denied due course or cancelled
 is not considered a candidate at all. Note that the law fixes the period within which a CoC may be filed.
[30]

 After this period, generally no other person may join the election 
contest. A notable exception to this general rule is the rule on 
substitution. The application of the exception, however, presupposes a 
valid CoC. Unavoidably, a "candidate" 
whose CoC has been cancelled or denied due course cannot he substituted for lack of a CoC,
 to all intents and purposes.
[31]
 Similarly, a successful 
quo warranto
 suit results in the ouster of an already elected official from office; substitution, for obvious reasons, can no longer apply. 



On the other hand, a candidate who was 
simply disqualified

 is merely prohibited from continuing as a candidate or from assuming or
 continuing to assume the functions of the office; substitution can thus
 take place under the terms of Section 77 of the OEC.
[32]
  
However, a three-term candidate with a valid and subsisting CoC cannot be substituted 
if 
the
 basis of the substitution is his disqualification on account of his 
three-term limitation.  Disqualification that is based on a breach of 
the three-term limit rule cannot be invoked as this disqualification can
 only take place after election where the three-term official emerged as
 winner
. As in a 
quo warranto
, any substitution is too late at this point.




As to the effects of a successful suit on
the right of the second placer in the elections:



In any of these three remedies, the doctrine of rejection of the second placer applies for the simple reason that -




To
 simplistically assume that the second placer would have received the 
other votes would be to substitute our judgment for the mind of the 
voter.  The second placer is just that, a second placer.  He lost the 
elections. He was repudiated by either a majority or plurality of 
voters.  He could not be considered the first among qualified candidates
 because in a field which excludes the disqualified candidate, the 
conditions would have substantially changed.  We are not prepared to 
extrapolate the results under such circumstances.
[33]



With the disqualification of the winning candidate and the application of the doctrine of rejection of the second placer, the 
rules on succession
 under the law accordingly apply.



As an 
exceptional situation
, however, the candidate with the second highest number of votes (
second placer
) may be validly proclaimed as the winner in the elections should the winning candidate be 
disqualified
 by final judgment 
before
 the ejections
,
 as clearly provided in Section 6 of R.A. No. 6646.  The same effect 
obtains when the electorate is fully aware, in fact and in law and 
within the realm of notoriety, of the disqualification, yet they still 
voted for the disqualified candidate. In this situation, the electorate 
that cast the plurality of votes in favor of the notoriously 
disqualified candidate is simply deemed to have waived their right to 
vote.



In a 
CoC cancellation
 proceeding, the law is silent 
on the legal effect of a judgment cancelling the CoC and does not also 
provide any temporal distinction. Given, however, the formal initiatory 
role a CoC plays and the standing it gives to a political aspirant, the 
cancellation of the CoC based on a finding of its invalidity effectively
 results in a vote for an 
inexistent 
"candidate" or for one who 
is deemed not to be in the ballot. Although legally a misnomer, the 
"second placer" should be proclaimed the winner as the candidate with 
the highest number of votes for the contested position. This same 
consequence should result if the cancellation case becomes final after 
elections, as the cancellation signifies non-candidacy from the very 
start, 
i.e.,
 from before the elections.




Violation of the three-term limit rule




a. The Three-Term Limit Rule.



The
 three-term limit rule is a creation of Section 8, Article X of the 
Constitution. This provision fixes the maximum, limit an elective local 
official can consecutively serve in office, and at the same time gives 
the command, in no uncertain terms, that 
no such official shall serve for more than three consecutive terms.
 Thus, a three-term local official is 
barred from serving a fourth and subsequent consecutive terms.



This
 bar, as a constitutional provision, must necessarily be read into and 
interpreted as a component part of the OEC under the legal reality that 
neither
 this Code nor the Local Government Code provides for the three-term 
limit rule's operational details; it is not referred to as a ground for 
the cancellation of a CoC nor for the disqualification of a candidate, 
much less ore its effects provided for.
 Thus, the need to fully consider, reconcile and harmonize the terms and effects of this rule with our election and other laws.




b. Is the Rule an Eligibility Requirement or a Disqualification?  



In
 practical terms, the question - of whether the three-term limit rule is
 a matter of "eligibility" that must be considered in the filing of a 
CoC - translates to the need to state in a would-be candidate's CoC 
application that he is eligible for candidacy because he has not served 
three consecutive terms immediately before filing his application.



The
 wording of Section 8, Article X of the Constitution, however, does not 
justify this requirement as Section 8 simply sets a limit on the number 
of consecutive terms ah official can serve. It does not refer to 
elections, much less does it bar a three-termer's candidacy. As 
previously discussed, Section 74 of the OEC does not expressly require a
 candidate to assert the 
non-possession
 of any disqualifying trait or condition, much less of a candidate's observance of the three-term limit rule. 
In
 fact, the assertion of a would-be candidate's eligibility, as required 
by the OEC, could not have contemplated making a three-term candidate 
ineligible 
for candidacy
 since that disqualifying trait began to exist only later under the 1987 Constitution.



What Section 8, Article X of the Constitution indisputably mandates is solely a bar against 
serving
 for a fourth consecutive term, not a bar against candidacy. 
Of
 course, between the filing of a CoC (that gives an applicant the status
 of a candidate) and assumption to office as an election winner is a 
wide expanse of election activities whose various stages our election 
laws treat in various different ways.  Thus, if candidacy will be 
aborted from the very start (
i.e
., at the initial CoC-filing 
stage), what effectively takes place - granting that the third-termer 
possesses all the eligibility elements required by law - is a shortcut 
that is undertaken on the theory that the candidate cannot serve in any 
way
 if 
he wins a fourth term.



I submit that while simple and efficient, 
essential
 legal considerations should dissuade the Court from using this 
approach. To make this shortcut is to incorporate into the law, by 
judicial fiat, a requirement that is not expressly there
. In other 
words, such shortcut may go beyond allowable interpretation that the 
Court can undertake, and cross over into prohibited judicial 
legislation. Not to so hold, on the other hand, does not violate the 
three-term limit rule even in spirit, since its clear and undisputed 
mandate is to disallow serving for a fourth consecutive term; this 
objective is achieved when the local official does not win and can 
always be attained by the direct application of the law if he does win.



Another reason, and an equally weighty one, is that a shortcut would run counter to 
the concept of  commonality that characterizes the eligibility requirements
;
 it would allow the introduction of an element that does not apply to 
all citizens as an entry qualification. Viewed from the prism of the 
general distinctions between eligibility and disqualification discussed 
above, the three-term limit is unavoidably a restriction that applies 
only to local officials who have served for three consecutive terms, not
 to all would-be candidates at large; it applies only to 
specific individuals

 who may have otherwise been eligible if not for the three-term limit 
rule and is thus a defect that attaches only to the candidate. In this 
sense, it cannot but be a disqualification and at that, a very specific 
one.



That the prohibited fourth consecutive term can only take 
place after a three-term local official wins, his fourth term signifies 
too that the prohibition (and the resulting disqualification) only takes
 place after elections.  This circumstance, to my mind, supports the 
view that the three-term limit rule does not at all involve itself with 
the matter of candidacy; it only regulates service beyond the limits the
 Constitution has set. 
Indeed, it is a big extrapolative leap for a 
prohibition that applies after election, to hark back and affect the 
initial election process for the filing of CoCs
.



Thus, on the whole, 1 submit that the legally sound view is 
not

 to bar a three-termer's candidacy for a fourth term if the three-term 
limit rule is the only reason for the bar. In these lights, the 
three-term limit rule â as a bar against a fourth consecutive term â is 
effectively a disqualification against such service rather than an 
eligibility requirement.
[36]




c. Filing of Petition and Effects.



As
 a disqualification that can only be triggered after the elections, it 
is not one that can be implemented or given effect before such. time. 
The reason is obvious; before that time, the gateway to the 4
th

 consecutive term has not been opened because the four-term 
re-electionist has not won. This reality brings into sharp locus the 
timing of the filing of a petition for disqualification for breach of 
the three-term limit rule.  Should a petition under the three-term limit
 rule be allowed only after the four-term official has won on the theory
 that it is at that point that the Constitution demands a bar?



The
 timing of the filing of the petition for disqualification is a matter 
of procedure that primarily rests with the COMELEC. Of course, a 
petition for disqualification cannot be filed against one who is not yet
 a candidate as only candidates (and winners) can be disqualified. 
Hence, the filing should be done after the filing of the CoC. On the 
matter of the time limitations of its filing, I believe that the 
petition does not need to be hobbled by the terms of COMCLBC Resolution 
No. 8696
[37]
 because of the
 special nature and characteristics of the three-term limit rule 
- 
i.e.
,
 the constitutional breach involved; the fact that it can be effective 
only after a candidate has won the election; and the lack of specific 
provision of the election laws covering it.



To be sure, a 
constitutional breach cannot be allowed to remain unattended because of 
the procedures laid down by administrative bodies. While 
Salcedo
 considers the remedy of
 quo warranto

 as almost the same as the remedy of cancellation on the question of 
eligibility, the fact that the remedies can be availed of only at 
particular periods of the election process signifies more than the 
temporal distinction.



From the point of view of eligibility, one 
who merely seeks to hold public office through a valid candidacy cannot 
wholly be treated in the same manner as one who has won and is at the 
point of assuming or serving the office to which he was elected; the 
requirements 
to be eligible as a candidate
 are defined by the election laws and by the local government code, but beyond these are 
constitutional restrictions on eligibility to serve
.
 The three-term limit rule serves as the best example of this fine 
distinction; a local official who is allowed to be a candidate under our
 statutes but who is effectively in his fourth term should be considered
 
ineligible
 to serve if the Court were to give life to the 
constitutional provision, couched in a strong prohibitory language, that
 "no such official shall serve for more than three consecutive terms."



A
 possible legal stumbling block in allowing the filing of the petition 
before the election is the existence of a cause of action or prematurity
 at that point.  If disqualification is triggered only after a 
three-temer has won, then it may be argued wiht some strength that a 
petition, filed agaist a respondent thre-term local official before he 
has won a fourth time, has not violated any law and does not give the 
petitioner the right to file a petition for lack of cause of action or 
prematurity.



I take the view, however, that the petition does not
 to be immediately acted upon and can merely be docketed as a cautionary
 petition reserved for future action if and when the three-term local 
official wins a fourth consecutive term.  If the parties proceed to 
ligitimate without raising the prematurity or lack of cause of action as
 objection, a ruling can be deferred until after cause of action 
accrues; if a ruling is entered, then any decreed disqualification 
cannot be given effect and implemented until a violation of the 
three-term limit rule occurs.



Unlike in an ordinary 
disqualification case (where a disqualification by final judgment before
 the elections against the victorious but disqualified candidate can 
catapult the second placer into office) and in a cancellation case 
(where the judgment, regardless of when it became final, against the 
victorious candidate with an invalid CoC similarly gives the "second 
placer"

 a right to assume office), a disqualification based on a 
violation of the three-term limit rule sets up a very high bar against 
the second placer unless he can clearly and convincingly show that the 
electorate had deliberately and knowingly misapplied their votes.




Rodolfo's petition is properly one for
disqualification



On the basis of the above discussions, I vote to grant the present petition.



Notwithstanding
 the caption of Dr. Rodolfo's petition, his petition is properly one for
 disqualification, since he only alleged a violation of the three-term 
limit rule - a disqualification, not a cancellation issue. Thus, the 
nature and consequences of a disqualification petition are what we must 
recognize and give effect to in this case.  This conclusion immediately 
impacts on Antipolo who, as second placer and in the absence of any of 
the exceptions, must bow out of the picture under the doctrine of 
rejection of the second placer.




First,

 as discussed above, a resulting disqualification based on a violation 
of the three-term limit rule cannot begin to operate until after the 
elections, where the three-term official emerged as victorious.
[39]

 There is no way that Antipolo, the second placer in the election, could
 assume the office of Mayor because no disqualification took effect 
before

 the elections against Lonzanida despite the decision rendered then. To 
reiterate, the prohibition against Lonzanida only look place 
after

 his election for his fourth consecutive term. At that point, the 
election was over and the people had chosen. With Lonzanida ineligible 
to assume office, the Vice-Mayor takes over by succession.




Second
,
 likewise, it has not been shown that the electorate deliberately and 
knowingly misapplied their voles in favor of Lonzanida, resulting in 
their disenfranchisement.  Since a disqualification based on a violation
 of the three-term limit rule does not affect a CoC that is otherwise 
valid, then Lonzanida remained a candidate who could be validly voted 
for in the elections.
[40]
  It 
was only when his disqualification was triggered that a permanent 
vacancy occurred in the office of the Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales. 
Under the LGC,
[41]
 it is Aratea, the duly-elected Vice Mayor, who should serve as Mayor in place of the elected but disqualified Lonzanida.

 If at all, only two grounds for disqualification under the Local Government Code 
may
 as well be considered for the cancellation of a CoC, 
viz
.:
 those with dual citizenship and permanent residence in a foreign 
country, or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and 
continue to avail of the same right after January 1, 1992. It may be

 Separate from these considerations is the possibility that the 
candidacy of a third-termer may be considered a nuisance candidacy under
 Section 69 of the OEC. Nuisance candidacy, by itself, is a special 
situation that has merited its own independent provision that calls for 
the denial or cancellation of the COC if the bases required by law are 
proven; thus, it shares the same remedy of cancellation for material 
misrepresentation on the eligibility requirements. The possibility of 
being a nuisance candidate is not discussed as it is not in issue in the
 case.

DISSENTING OPINION






REYES, 
J
.:



I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion and offer my humble consideration of the issues presented in this case.




The Issues



In this case, the Court is called upon to resolve the following issues:




Whether
 the petition filed before the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) is a 
petition to cancel a certificate of candidacy (COC) or a petition to 
disqualify;
Whether the COMELEC correctly disposed the case in accordance with the nature of the petition filed; and
Whether
 private respondent Estela D. Antipolo (Antipole) who obtained the 
second highest number of Votes may be proclaimed the mayor of San 
Antonio, Zambales.




The petition filed against Romeo 
Lonzanida (Lonzanida) is one for 
disqualification and not for 
cancellation of COC.



It is my view that the petition filed against Lonzanida is in the nature of a petition for disqualification.



It is significant to note that the challenge to Lonzanida's candidacy originated from a 
Petition to Disqualify/Deny Due Course to and/or Cancel the Certificate of Candidacy

 filed by Dra. Sigrid Rodolfo (Dra. Rodolfo), seeking the cancellation 
of the Former's COC on the ground of misrepresentation. Dra. Rodolfo 
alleged that Lonzanida made a material misrepresentation in his COC by 
stating that he was eligible to run as Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales 
when in fact he has already served for four (4) consecutive terms for 
the same position, in violation of Section 8, Article X of the 1987 
Constitution and Section 43(b) of R.A. No. 7160.
[1]

 After evaluating the merits of the petition, the COMELEC Second 
Division issued the Resolution dated February 18, 2010 granting the 
petition, disposing thus:




The three-term limit rule 
was initially proposed to be an absolute bar to any elective local 
government official from running for the same position after serving 
three consecutive terms. The said disqualification was primarily 
intended to forestall the accumulation of massive political power by an 
elective local government official in a given locality in order to 
perpetuate his tenure in office. Corollary to this, the need to broaden 
the choices of the electorate of the candidates who will run for office,
 and to infuse new blood in the political arena by disqualifying 
officials running for the same office after nine years of holding the 
same.
Respondent Lonzanida never denied having held the office of
 mayor of San Antonio, Zambales for more than nine consecutive years. 
Instead, he raised arguments to forestall or dismiss the petition on the
 grounds other than the main issue itself. We find such arguments as 
wanting. Respondent Lonzanida, for holding the office of mayor for more 
than three consecutive terms, went against the three-term limit rule; 
therefore, he could not be allowed to run anew in the 2010 elections.  
It is time to infuse new blood in the political arena of San Antonio.
WHEREFORE
, premises considered,, the instant petition is hereby 
GRANTED
.
 The Certificate of Candidacy of Respondent Romeo D. Lonzanida for the 
position of mayor in the municipality of San Antonio, Zambales is hereby
 
CANCELLED
.  His name is hereby ordered 
STRICKEN OFF
 the list of Official Candidates for the position of Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales in the May 10, 2010 elections.
SO ORDERED
.
[2]
 (Citation omitted)



Upon Lonzanida's motion for reconsideration, the COMELEC 
en banc
 affirmed the ruling of the Second Division in its Resolution
[3]

 dated August 11, 2010 further noting that Lonzanida was even more 
disqualified to run in the elections by reason of a final judgment of 
conviction against him for a crime punishable for more than one (1) year
 of imprisonment, thus:




It is likewise worth 
mentioning at this point that Lonzanida has been found by no less than 
the Supreme Court guilty beyond reasonable doubt often (10) counts of 
Falsification under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code.  We take 
judicial notice of the fact that the Supreme Court, in the case of 
Lonzanida vs. People of the Philippines
, has affirmed the Resolution of the Sandiganbayan which contains the following dispositive portion:
"WHEREFORE,
 premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Mayor 
Romeo Lonzanida y Dumlao guilty of ten (10) counts of Falsification of 
Public Document defined and penalized under Article 171 par. 2 of the 
Revised Penal Code, and in the absence of any mitigating and aggravating
 circumstances, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, said accused is
 hereby sentenced to suffer in each of the cases the penalty of 
imprisonment of four (4) years and one (1) day of prision correccional 
as minimum to eight (8) years and one (1) day of pris[i]on mayor as 
maximum, and to pay a fine of [P]5,000.00, in each of the cases without 
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency."
Based on
 the above-mentioned affirmed Decision, Lonzanida shall suffer the 
penalty of imprisonment of four (4) years and one (1) day of prision 
correccional as minimum to eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision 
mayor as maximum.  In view of the said Decision, Lonzanida is, 
therefore, disqualified to run for any local elective position pursuant 
to Section 40(a) of the Local Government Code x x x:
x x x x
Prescinding
 from the foregoing premises, Lonzanida, for having served as Mayor of 
San Antonio, Zambales for more than three (3) consecutive terms and for 
having been convicted by a final judgment of a crime punishable by more 
than one (1) year of imprisonment, is clearly disqualified to run for 
the same position in the May 2010 Elections.
WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby 
DENIED.
SO ORDERED
.
[4]
 (Citations omitted)



In
 the foregoing dispositions, the COMELEC overlooked the distinction 
between the remedies presented before it. It bears stressing that while 
the petition filed by Dra. Rodolfo against Lonzanida was titled as a 
Petition to Disqualify/Deny due Course to and/or Cancel the Certificate of Candidacy
,
 the designation pertains to two (2) different remedies: petition for 
disqualification and petition to deny due course or cancel a COC



In the recent case of
 Fermin v. Commission on Elections
[5]

 this Court emphasized the distinctions between the two remedies which 
seemed to have been obliterated by the imprudent use of the terms in a 
long line of jurisprudence. In the said case, Umbra Ramit Bayam 
Dilangalen, a mayoralty candidate of Northern Kabuntalan in Shariff 
Kabunsuan, filed a petition for disqualification against Mike A. Fermin 
on the ground that he did not possess the required period of residency 
to qualify as candidate.  This Court, speaking through Associate Justice
 Antonio Eduardo B. Nachura, held:




Pivotal in the ascertainment of the timeliness of the Dilangalen petition is its proper characterization.
As
 aforesaid, petitioner, on the one hand, argues that the Dilangalen 
petition was filed pursuant to Section 78 of the OEC; while private 
respondent counters that the same is based on Section 68 of the Code.
After
 studying the said petition in detail, the Court finds that the same is 
in the nature of a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC under 
Section 78 of the OEC.  The petition contains the essential allegations 
of a "Section 78" petition, namely: (1) the candidate made a 
representation in his certificate; (2) the representation pertains to a 
material matter which would affect the substantive rights of the 
candidate (the right to run for the election for which he filed his 
certificate); and (3) the candidate made the false representation with 
the intention to deceive the electorate as to his qualification for 
public office or deliberately attempted to mislead, misinform, or hide a
 fact which would otherwise render him ineligible. It likewise 
appropriately raises a question on a candidate's eligibility for public 
office, in this case, his possession of the one-year residency 
requirement under the law.
Lest it be misunderstood, the denial of due course to or the cancellation of the CoC is 
not
 based on the lack of qualifications but on a finding that the candidate
 made a material representation that is false, which may relate to the 
qualifications required of the public office he/she is running for
.  It is noted that the candidate states in his/her CoC that he/she is 
eligible
 for the office he/she seeks.  
Section 78 of the OEC, therefore, is to be read in relation to the constitutional and statutory provisions on 
qualifications or eligibility

 for public office. If the candidate subsequently states a material 
representation in the CoC that is false, the COMELEC, following the law,
 is empowered to deny the course to or cancel such certificate
, indeed, the Court has already likened a proceeding under Section 78 to a 
quo warranto

 proceeding under Section 253 of the OEC since they both deal with the 
eligibility or qualification of a candidate, with the distinction mainly
 in the fact that a "Section 78" petition is filed before proclamation, 
while a petition for 
quo warranto
 is filed after proclamation of the winning candidate.
At
 this point, we must stress that a "Section 78" petition ought not to be
 interchanged or confused with a "Section 68" petition. 
They are different remedies, based on different grounds, and resulting in different eventualities
. 
 Private respondent's insistence, therefore, that the petition it ftted 
before the COMELEC in SPA No. 07-372 is in the nature of a 
disqualification case under Section 68, as it is in fact captioned a 
"Petition for Disqualification," does not persuade the Court.
The
 ground raised in the Dilangalen petition is that Fermin allegedly 
lacked one of the qualifications to be elected as mayor of Northern 
Kabuntalan, 
i.e.
, he had not established residence in the said 
locality for at least one year immediately preceding the election. 
Failure to meet the one-year residency requirement for the public office
 
is not a ground for the "disqualification" of a candidate
 under Section 68. The provision only refers 
to the commission of prohibited acts and the possession of a permanent resident status in a foreign country
 as grounds for disqualification, x x x.

It bears emphasizing that while both remedies aim to prevent a candidate 
from joining the electoral race, they are separate and distinct from 
each other. One remedy must not he confused with the other lest the 
consequences of a judgment for one be imposed for a judgment on the 
other to the prejudice of the parties. They are governed by separate 
provisions of law, which provide for different sets of grounds, varying 
prescriptive periods and consequences.




As to governing law, a petition to cancel the COC of a candidate is filed under Section 78 of the OEC which provides:




Sec. 78. 
Petition to deny due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy
.
 - A verified petition seeking to deny due course or to cancel a 
certificate of candidacy may be filed by any person exclusively on the 
ground that any material representation contained therein as required 
under Section 74 hereof is false. The petition may he filed at any time 
not later than twenty-five days from the time of the filing of the 
certificate of candidacy and shall be decided, alter due notice and 
hearing, not later than fifteen days before the election.






As
 mentioned in the above-stated provision, a petition under Section 78 
may he filed if a candidate made a material representation in his COC 
with respect to the details which are required to be stated therein 
under Section 74 of the OEC which reads:




Sec. 74. 
Contents of certificate of candidacy
.
 - The certificate of candidacy shall state that the person filing it is
 announcing his candidacy for the office staled therein and that he is 
eligible for said office; if for Member of the Batasang Pambansa,
 the province, including its component cities, highly urbanized city or 
district or sector which he seeks to represent; the political patty to 
which he belongs; civil status; his date of birth; residence; his post 
office address for all election purposes; his profession or occupation; 
that he will support and defend the Constitution of the Philippines and 
will maintain true faith and allegiance thereto; that he will obey the 
laws, legal orders, and decrees promulgated by the duly constituted 
authorities; that lie is not a permanent resident or immigrant to a 
foreign country; that the obligation imposed by his oath is assumed 
voluntarily, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that 
the facts stated in the certificate of candidacy are true to the best of
 his knowledge.
Unless a candidate has officially changed his 
name through a court approved proceeding, a certificate shall use in a 
certificate of candidacy the name by which he has been baptized, or if 
he has not been baptized in any church or religion, the name registered 
in the office of the local civil registrar or any other name allowed 
under the provisions of existing law or, in the case of a Muslim, his 
Hadji name after performing the prescribed religious pilgrimage: 
Provided, That when there are two or more candidates for an office with 
the same name and surname, each candidate, upon being made aware or such
 fact, shall state his paternal and maternal surname, except the 
incumbent who may continue to use the name and surname stated in his 
certificate of candidacy when he was elected, lie may also include one 
nickname or stage name by which he is generally or popularly known in 
the locality.




In order to justify the cancellation 
of COC, it is essential that the false representation mentioned therein 
pertain to a material matter for the sanction imposed by this provision 
would affect the substantive rights of a candidate the right to run for 
the elective post for which he filed the certificate of candidacy.  
Although the law does not specify what would be considered as a 
"material representation," the Court concluded that this refers to 
qualifications for elective office, it contemplates statements regarding
 age, residence and citizenship or non-possession of natural-born 
Filipino status.  Furthermore, aside from the requirement of 
materiality, the false representation must consist of a deliberate 
attempt to mislead, misinform, or hide a fact which would otherwise 
render a candidate ineligible.  In other words, it must be made with an 
intention to deceive the electorate as to one's qualification for public
 office.
[7]




On the other hand, a petition for disqualification may be filed under Section 68 of the OEC which slates:




Sec. 68. 
Disqualifications.

 â Any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he is a party is 
declared by final decision of a competent court guilty of, or found by 
the Commission of having: (a) given money or other material 
consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public 
officials performing electoral functions; (b) committed acts of 
terrorism to enhance his candidacy; (c) spent in his election campaign 
an amount in excess of that allowed by this Code; (d) solicited, 
received or made any contribution prohibited under Sections 89, 95, 96, 
97 and 104; or (e) violated any of Sections 80, 83, 85, 86. and 261, 
paragraphs d, c, k, v, and cc, sub-paragraph 6, shall be disqualified 
from continuing as a candidate, or if he has been elected, from holding 
the office. Any person who is a permanent resident of or an immigrant to
 a foreign country shall not be qualified to run for any elective office
 under this Code, unless said person has waived his status as permanent 
resident or immigrant of a foreign country in accordance with the 
residence requirement provided for In the election laws.




The
 same petition may also he filed pursuant, to Section 12 of the QEC and 
Section 40 of the LGC which provide for other grounds for 
disqualification to run for public office, 
viz
:




Section 12 of the OEC 
Sec. 12. 
Disqualifications. 
Any
 person who has been declared by competent authority insane or 
incompetent, or has been sentenced by final judgment for subversion, 
insurrection, rebellion, or for any offense for which he has been 
sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months or for a crime, 
involving moral turpitude, shall be disqualified to be a candidate and 
to hold any office, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted 
amnesty.
The disqualifications to be a candidate herein provided 
shall be deemed removed upon the declaration by competent authority that
 said insanity or incompetence had been removed or after the expiration 
of a period of five years from his service or sentence, unless within 
the same period he again becomes disqualified.
Section 40 of the LGC
Sec. 40. 
Disqualifications
. The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:
(a)
 Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral 
turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of 
imprisonment within two (2) years after serving sentence;
(b) Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case;
(c) Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic;
(d) Those with dual citizenship;
(e) Fugitives from justice in criminal or non-political cases  here or abroad;
(f)
 Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the
 right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after 
the effectivity of this Code; and
(g) The insane or feeble-minded.






Disqualification
 proceedings are initiated for the purpose of barring an individual from
 becoming a candidate or from continuing as a candidate for public 
office.  In other words, the objective is to eliminate a candidate from 
the race either from the start or during its progress.  On the other 
hand, proceedings for the cancellation of COC seek a declaration of 
ineligibility, that is, the lack of qualifications prescribed in the 
Constitution or the statutes for holding public office and the purpose 
of the proceedings for declaration of ineligibility is to remove the 
incumbent from office.
[8]




In
 her petition, Dra. Rodolfo alleged that Lonzanida violated Section 8, 
Article X of the Constitution, replicated under Section 43(b) of the 
LGC, which provides for the proscription against occupying the same 
public office for more than three (3) consecutive terms to support her 
action to prevent the latter from pursuing his candidacy in the May 2010
 elections. The core of her petition is the purported misrepresentation 
committed by Lonzanida in his COC by staling he was eligible to run as 
Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales when in fact he has already served for 
the same position in 1998 to 2001, 2001 to 2004, 2004 to 2007 and 2007 
to 2010.  However, violation of the three-term limit is not stated as a 
ground for filing a petition under Section 78, Section 68 or Section 12 
of the OEC or Section 40 of the LGC. In order to make a fitting 
disposition of the present controversy, it has to be determined whether 
the petition filed against Lonzanida is actually a petition for 
cancellation of COC or a petition for disqualification.




To 
reiterate, the ground for filing a petition for cancellation of COC is 
basically a misrepresentation of the details required to be stated in 
the COC which, in Lonzanida's case, pertain to the basic qualifications 
for candidates for local elective positions provided under Section 39 of
 the LGC which reads:




Sec. 39. 
Qualifications. 
- (a) An elective local official must be a citizen of the Philippines; a registered voter in the 
barangay
, municipality, city, or province or, in the case of a member of the 
sangguniang panlalawigan, sangguniang panlungsod,
 or 
sangguniang bayan,

 the district where he intends to be elected; a resident (herein for at 
least one (I) year immediately preceding the day of the election; and 
able to read and write Filipino or any other local language or dialect.
x x x x
(c)
 Candidates for the position of mayor or vice-mayor of independent 
component cities, component cities, or municipalities must be at least 
twenty-one (21) years of age on election day.




These 
basic requirements, which former Senator Aquilino Pimentel, the 
principal author of the LGC, termed as "positive qualifications"
[9]

 are the requisite status or circumstances which a local candidate must 
have at the time of filing of his COC. Essentially, the details required
 to be stated in the COC are the personal circumstances of the 
candidate, 
i.e
., name/stagename, age, civil status, citizenship 
and residency, which serve as basis of his eligibility to become a 
candidate faking into consideration the standards set under the law.  
The manifest intent of the law in imposing these qualifications is to 
confine the right to participate in the elections to local residents who
 have reached the age when they can seriously reckon the gravity of the 
responsibility they wish to take on and who, at the same time, are 
heavily acquainted with the actual state and urgent demands of the 
community.




On the other hand, the grounds for disqualification 
refer to acts committed by an aspiring local servant, or to a 
circumstance, status or condition which renders him unfit for public 
service.  Contrary to the effect of Section 39 of the LGC possession of 
any of the grounds for disqualification results to the forfeiture of the
 right of a candidate to participate in the elections.  Thus, while a 
person may possess the core eligibilities required under Section 39, he 
may Still be prevented from running for a local elective post if he has 
any of the disqualifications stated in Section 40.  The rationale behind
 prescribing these disqualifications is to limit the light to hold 
public office to those who are fit to exercise the privilege in order to
 preserve the purity of the elections.
[10]




Based
 on the foregoing disquisition on the nature of the two remedies, I find
 that the violation of the three-term limit cannot be a ground for 
cancellation of COC.  To emphasize, this remedy can only be pursued in 
cases of material misrepresentation in the COC, which are limited to the
 details that must be stated therein.  Moreover, Antipolo's contention 
that Lonzanida should be deemed to have made a misrepresentation in his 
COC when he stated that he was eligible to run when in fact he was not 
is inconsistent with the basic rule in statutory construction that 
provisions of a law should be construed as a whole and not as a series 
of disconnected articles and phrases.  In the absence of a clear 
contrary intention, words and phrases in statutes should not be 
interpreted in isolation from one another. A word or phrase in a statute
 is always used in association with other words or phrases and its 
meaning may thus be modified or restricted by the latter.
[11]

 Thus, the statement in the COC which contains a declaration by the 
candidate that he is "eligible to the office he seeks to be elected to" 
must be strictly construed to refer only to the details pertaining to 
his qualifications, 
i.e
., age, citizenship or residency, among 
others, which the law requires him to state in his COC which he must 
even swear under oath to possess.




Considering that the number of 
terms for which a local candidate had served is not required to be 
stated in the COC, it cannot be a ground for a petition to cancel a COC.
 The question now is, can it be a ground for a petition for 
disqualification?  I believe that it can.




Pertinently, Section 8, Article X of the Constitution states:




Sec. 8. The term of office of elective local officials, except 
barangay
 officials, which shall be determined by law, shall be three years and 
no such official shall serve for more than three consecutive terms
.
 Voluntary renunciation of the office for any length of lime shall not 
be considered as an interruption in (he continuity of his service for 
the full term for which he was elected. (Emphasis ours)




As it is worded, that a candidate for a local elective position has violated the three-term limit is a 
disqualification

 as it is a status, circumstance or condition which bars him from 
running for public office despite the possession of all the 
qualifications under Section 39 of the LGC.




It follows that the 
petition filed by Dra. Rodolfo against Lonzanida should be considered a 
petition for disqualification and not a petition to cancel a CoC.




Overlooking
 the delineation between the two remedies presents the danger of 
confusing the proper disposition of one for the other.  Although both 
remedies may affect She status of candidacy of a person running for 
public office, the difference lies with the breadth of the effect. In 
Fermin
, we elucidated, thus:




While
 a person who is disqualified under Section 68 is merely prohibited to 
continue as a candidate, the person whose certificate is cancelled or 
denied due course under Section 78 is not treated as a candidate at all,
 as if he/she never filed a COC.
 Thus, in 
Miranda v. Abaya,
 
this Court made the distinction that a candidate who is disqualified 
under Section 68 can validly be substituted under Section 77 of the OEC 
because be/she remains a candidate until disqualified; but a person 
whose COC has been denied due course or cancelled under Section 78 
cannot be substituted because he/she is never considered a candidate.

In,
 its Resolution dated February 18, 2010, the COMELEC, while finding that
 Lonzanida is disqualified to run as Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales for 
having sewed the same position for more than three (3) consecutive 
terms, ordered for the cancellation of Lonzanida's COC.  In effect, it 
cancelled Lonzanida's COC on the basis of a ground which is fittingly a 
ground for a petition for disqualification, not for a petition to cancel
 a COC The same holds true wish respect to Lonzanidas' conviction for 
ten (10) counts of falsification which was taken up by the COMELEC in 
resolving Lonzanida's motion for reconsideration in its Resolution dated
 August 11, 2010 notwithstanding the fact that said ground was not even 
alleged in the petition filed by Dra. Rodolfo.




A final 
judgment of disqualification

 before the elections is necessary 

before the voles east in favor of a 

candidate be considered stray.




Anent the effect of a judgment of disqualification, Section 72 of the OEC is clear.  It states;




Sec. 72. 
Effects of disqualification cases and priority
. - x x x. 
x x x x
Any candidate who has been 
declared by final judgment

 to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the voles cast foe him 
shall not he counted. Nevertheless, if for any reason, a candidate is 
not declared by final judgment before an election to be disqualified and
 he is voted for and receives the winning number of votes in such 
election, his violation of the provisions of the preceding sections 
shall not prevent his proclamation and assumption to office. (Emphasis 
ours)






The foregoing provision was reiterated in Section 6 of R.A. No. 6646, pertaining to "The Electoral Reforms Law of 1987," thus:




See. 6.
 Effect of Disqualification Case.
 - Any candidate who has been 
declared by final judgment

 to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the votes east for him 
shall not he counted.  If for any reason a candidate is not declared by 
final judgment before an election to he disqualified and he is voted for
 and receives the winning number of votes in such election, the Court or
 Commission shall continue with the trial and hearing of the action, 
inquiry, or protest and, upon motion of the complainant or any 
intervenor, may during the pendency thereof order the suspension of the 
proclamation of such candidate whenever the evidence of his guilt is 
strong. (Emphasis ours)




It can be gathered from the 
foregoing that a judgment of disqualification against a candidate conies
 into full effect only upon attaining finality.  Before that period, the
 candidate facing a disqualification case may still he voted for and 
even be proclaimed winner.  After the judgment of disqualification has 
become final and executory, the effect on the stains of his candidacy 
will depend on whether the finality took effect before or after the day 
of elections.  If the judgment became final before the elections, he may
 no longer be considered a candidate and the votes cast in his favor arc
 considered stray. On the other hand, if the judgment lapsed into 
finality after the elections, he is stilt considered a candidate and the
 votes cast in his name during the elections shall be counted in his 
favor.




The requirement for a final judgment ultimately redounds 
to the benefit of the electorate who can still freely express their will
 by naming the candidate of their choice in their ballots without being 
delimited by the fact that one of the candidates is facing a 
disqualification case. It effectively thwarts indecent efforts of a less
 popular candidate in eliminating competition with the more popular 
candidate by mere expedient of filing a disqualification case against 
him. In the same manner, it ensures that an ineligible candidate, even 
after lie was proclaimed the winner, can still be ousted from office and
 be replaced with the truly deserving one. In order not to frustrate 
these objectives by reason of the protracted conduct of the proceedings,
 the Rules provide that the COMELEC retains its jurisdiction even after 
elections, if for any reason no final judgment of disqualification is 
rendered before the elections, and the candidate facing disqualification
 is voted for  and  receives  the  highest  number of votes.  Thus, in 
Sunga v. COMELEC
[13]
 we enunciated:




Clearly,
 the legislative intent is that the COMELEC should continue the trial 
and hearing of the disqualification case to its conclusion, 
i.e
.,
 until judgment is rendered thereon. The word "shall" signifies that 
this requirement of the law is mandatory, operating to impose a positive
 duty which must be enforced. The implication is that the COMELEC is 
left with no discretion but to proceed with the disqualification case 
even after the election, x x x.
x x x A candidate guilty of 
election offenses would be undeservedly rewarded, instead of punished, 
by the dismissal of the disqualification case against him simply because
 the investigating body was unable, for any reason caused upon it, to 
determine before the election if the offenses were indeed committed by 
the candidate sought to be disqualified. All that the erring aspirant 
would need to do is to employ delaying tactics so that the 
disqualification case based on the commission of election offenses would
 not be decided before the election. This scenario is productive of more
 fraud which certainly is not the main intent and purpose of the law.
[14]
 (Citation omitted)






Without
 a final judgment, a candidate facing disqualification may still be 
proclaimed the winner and assume the position for which he was voted 
For. In the absence of an  order suspending proclamation, the winning 
candidate who is sought to be disqualified is entitled to be proclaimed 
as a matter of law. This is clear from Section 6 of R.A. No. 6646 which 
provides that the proclamation of the candidate sought to be 
disqualified is suspended only if there is an order of the COMELEC 
suspending proclamation.
[15]
 
The mere pendency of a disqualification case against a candidate, and a 
winning candidate at that, does not justify the suspension of his 
proclamation after winning in the ejection. To hold otherwise would 
unduly encourage the filing of baseless and malicious petitions for 
disqualification if only to effect the suspension of the proclamation of
 the winning candidate, not only to his damage and prejudice but also to
 the defeat of the sovereign will of the electorate, and for the undue 
benefit of undeserving third parties.
[16]




The candidate receiving the second 

highest number of votes cannot be

 proclaimed the winner.




It
 must be noted that after the issuance of the Resolution dated August 
11, 2010, the COMELEC rendered two more issuances that are now being 
assailed in the instant petition - the Order dated January 12, 2011 and 
the Resolution dated February 2, 2011. During the interim period, the 
May 2010 election was held and Lonzanida received the highest number of 
votes and was proclaimed winner. Upon finality of the judgment of his 
disqualification, a permanent vacancy was created in the office of the 
mayor and Efren Racel Aratea (Aratea), the duly-elected Vice-Mayor of 
San Antonio, Zambales, assumed the position per authority granted to him
 by the DILG Secretary. 




Thereafter, on August 25, 2010, fourteen
 (14) Days after the issuance of the Resolution dated August 11, 2010, 
Antipolo filed a motion to intervene and to admit attached 
petition-in-intervention. Antipolo alleged that she has a legal interest
 in the matter in litigation being the only remaining qualified 
candidate for the office of the mayor of San Antonio, Zambales after 
Lonzanida's disqualification.
[17]
 
 Having obtained the highest number of votes among the remaining 
qualified candidates for the position, she opined that  she should be 
proclaimed the mayor of the locality.
[18]
  Subsequently, the COMELEC
 en banc 
allowed Antipolo's motion to intervene in its Order dated January 12, 2011, thus:




Acting
 on the "Motion for Leave to Intervene and to Admit 
Attached Petition-in-Intervention" filed by Estela D. Antipolo 
(Antipolo) and pursuant to the power of this Commission to suspend its 
Rules or any portion thereof in the interest of justice, this Commission
 hereby RESOLVES to:


1.  
GRANT 
the aforesaid Motion;

2. 
ADMIT
 the Petition-in-Intervention filed by Antipolo;

3. 
REQUIRE
 the Respondent, 
ROMEO DUMLAO LONZANIDA
, as well as  
EFREN RACEL ARATEA
,
 proclaimed Vice-Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales, to file their 
respective Comments on the Petition-in-Intervention within a 
non-extendible period of five (5) days from receipt hereof; end

4. 
SET
 the above-mentioned Petition-in-Intervention for hearing on January 26, 2011 at 10:00 a.m., COMELEC Session Hall, 8
th
 Floor, Palacio del Gobernador, Intramuros[,] Manila.
[19]






On February 2, 2011, the COMELEC
 en banc

 issued a Resolution nullifying Aratea's proclamation as acting mayor 
and ordering him to cease and desist from discharging the duties of the 
office of the mayor.  Further, it ordered for the constitution of a 
Special Board of Canvassers to proclaim Antipolo as the duly-elected 
Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales, ratiocinating as follows:




It
 is beyond cavil that Lonzanida is not eligible to hold and discharge 
the functions of the Office of the Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales. The 
sole issue to be resolved at this juncture is how to fill the vacancy 
resulting from Lonzanida's disqualification Intervenor Antipolo claims 
that being the sole qualified candidate who obtained the highest number 
of votes, she should perforce be proclaimed as Mayor of San Antonio, 
Zambales.  Oppositor Aratea on the other hand argues that Anlipolo is a 
mere second placer who can never be proclaimed, and that the resulting 
vacancy should be filled in accordance with Section 44 of the Local 
Government Code of 1991.
In order to judiciously resolve this 
issue however, we wish to emphasize the character of the 
disqualification of respondent Lonzanida.
As early as February 
18, 2010, the Commission speaking through the Second Division had 
already ordered the cancellation of Lonzanida's certificate of 
candidacy, and had slacken off his name in the list of official 
candidates for the mayoralty post of San Antonio, Zambales[.]  
Thereafter, the Commission En Banc in its resolution dated August 11, 
2010 unanimously affirmed the resolution disqualifying Lonzanida.  Our 
findings, were likewise sustained by the Supreme Court no less. The 
disqualification of Lonzanida is not simply anchored on one ground. On 
the contrary, it was emphasized in our En Bane resolution that 
Lonzanida's disqualification is two-pronged: 
first
, he violated 
the constitutional fiat on the three-term limit; and second, as early as
 December 1, 2009, he is known to have been convicted by final judgment 
for ten (10) counts of Falsification under Article 171 of the Revised 
Penal Code.  In other words, on election day, respondent Lonzanida's 
disqualification is notoriously known in Fact and in law.  Ergo, since 
respondent was 
never a candidate
 for the position of Mayor, San Antonio,
 Zambales, the votes cast for him should be considered stray votes. 
Consequently, Intervenor Anlipola, who remains as the sole qualified 
candidate for the mayoralty post and obtained the highest number of 
voles should now be proclaimed as the duly[-]elecled Mayor of San 
Antonio, Zambales.
We cannot sustain the submission of Oppositor 
Aratea that IntervenoT Anlipolo could never be proclaimed as the duly 
elected Mayor of Antipok) [sic] for being a second placer in the 
elections- The teachings in the cases of Codilla vs. De Venecia and 
Nazareno and Domino vs. Comelec[,] et al, while they remain sound 
jurisprudence find no application in the case at bar. What sets this 
case apart from the cited jurisprudence is that the notoriety of 
Lonzanida's disqualification and ineligibility to hold public office is 
established both in fact and in law on election day itself.  Hence, 
Lonzanida's name, as already ordered by the Commission on February 18, 
2010 should have been stricken off from the list of official candidates 
for Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales.
[20]
 (Citations omitted)




The
 foregoing ratiocination is illustrative of the complication that can 
result from the inability to distinguish the differences between a 
petition for disqualification and a petition for cancellation of COC. It
 bears emphasizing that in terms of effect, a judgment on a petition to 
cancel a COC touches the very eligibility of a person So qualify as a 
candidate such that an order for cancellation of his COC renders him a 
non-candidate as if he never filed a COC at all. The ripple effect is 
that all votes cast in his favor shall be considered stray. Thus, the 
candidate receiving the second highest number of votes may be proclaimed
 the winner as he is technically considered the candidate who received 
the highest number of votes.  Further, it is of no consequence if the 
judgment on the petition to cancel COC became final before or after the 
elections since the consequences of the same retroact to the date of 
filing of the COC.




On the other hand, the breadth of the effect a judgment on a petition for disqualification is relatively less extensive. 
First
,
 the effect of a judgment thereon is limited to preventing a candidate 
from continuing his participation in the electoral race or, if already 
proclaimed, to unseat from public office.  
Second,
 the judgment 
takes effect only upon finality which can occur either before or after 
the elections. If the judgment became final before the elections, the 
effect is similar to the cancellation of a COC. However, if the judgment
 became final after the elections, he is still considered an official 
candidate and may even be proclaimed winner should he receive the 
highest number of votes in the elections. In the event that he is 
finally ousted out of office, Section 44 of the LGC will govern the 
succession into the vacated office.




Relating the foregoing 
principle to the instant case, Lonzanida is still considered an official
 candidate in the May 2010 elections notwithstanding the pendency of the
 disqualification case against him. The mere pendency of a 
disqualification case against him is not sufficient to deprive him of 
the right to be voted for because the law requires no less than a final 
judgment of disqualification. Consequently, the. COMELEC should not have
 ordered for the proclamation Antipolo as Mayor of San Antonio, 
Zambales.  It is well-settled that the disqualification of the winning 
candidate does not give the candidate who garnered the second highest 
number of votes the right to be proclaimed to the vacated post. In 
Aquino v. Commission on Elections
,
[21]
 we had the occasion to explicate She rationale behind this doctrine. Thus:




To
 contend that Syjuco should be proclaimed because he was the "first" 
among the qualified candidates in the May 8, 1995 elections is to 
misconstrue the nature of the democratic electoral process and the 
sociological and psychological underpinnings behind voters' 
preferences.  The result suggested by private respondent would lead not 
only to our reversing the doctrines firmly entrenched in the two cases 
of Labo vs. Comelec but also to a massive disenfranchisement of the 
thousands of voters who cast their vote in favor of a candidate they 
believed could be validly voted for during the elections. Had petitioner
 been disqualified before the elections, the choice, moreover, would 
have been different. The votes for Aquino given the acrimony which 
attended the campaign, would not have automatically gone to second 
placer Syjuco. The nature of the playing field would have substantially 
changed. To simplistically assume that the second placer would have 
received the other votes would be to substitute our judgment for the 
mind of the voter. The second placer is just that, a second placer. lie 
lost the elections. Me was repudiated by either a majority or plurality 
of voters. He could not be considered the first among qualified 
candidates because in a Held which excludes the disqualified candidate, 
the conditions would have substantially changed. We are not prepared to 
extrapolate the results under such circumstances.

We

 cannot, in another shift of the pendulum, subscribe to the contention 
that the runner-up in an election in which the winner has been 
disqualified is actually the winner among the remaining qualified 
candidates because this clearly represents a minority view supported 
only by a scattered number of obscure American state and English court 
decisions. These decisions neglect the possibility that the runner-up, 
though obviously qualified, could receive votes so measly and 
insignificant in number that the votes they receive would be tantamount 
to rejection.  Theoretically, the "second placer" could receive just one
 vote.  In such a case, it is absurd to proclaim the totally repudiated 
candidate as the voters' "choice."  Moreover, even in instances where 
the votes received by the second placer may not be considered 
numerically insignificant, voters preferences are nonetheless so 
volatile and unpredictable that the result among qualified candidates, 
should the equation change because of the disqualification of an 
ineligible candidate, would not be self-evident. Absence of the apparent
 though ineligible winner among the choices could lead to a shifting of 
votes to candidates other than the second placer. By any mathematical 
formulation, the runner-up in an election cannot be construed to have 
obtained a majority or plurality of votes cast where an "ineligible" 
candidate has garnered either a majority or plurality of the votes.

Apparently,
 in its Resolution dated February 2, 2011, the COMELEC submits to the 
general rule that the second placer in the elections does not assume the
 post vacated by the winning candidate in the event that a final 
judgment of disqualification is rendered against the latter. However, it
 posits that the notoriety of Lonzanida's disqualification and 
ineligibility to hold public office distinguishes the instant case from 
the throng of related cases upholding the doctrine. It anchored ils 
ruling in the pronouncement we made in 
Labo, Jr.  v. Commission on Elections
,
[24]
 to wit:




The
 rule would have been different if the electorate fully aware in fact 
and in law of a candidate's disqualification so as to bring such 
awareness within the realm of notoriety, would nonetheless cast their 
voles in favor of the ineligible candidate.  In such case, the 
electorate may be said to have waived the validity and efficacy of their
 voles by notoriously misapplying their franchise or throwing away their
 votes, in which case, the eligible candidate obtaining the next higher 
number of votes may be deemed elected.
[25]




The
 exception is predicated on the concurrence of two assumptions, namely: 
(1) the one who obtained the highest number of votes is disqualified; 
and (2) the electorate is fully aware in fact and in law of a 
candidate's disqualification so as to bring such awareness within the 
realm of notoriety but nonetheless cast their votes in favor of the 
ineligible candidate. These assumptions however do not obtain in the 
present case.  The COMELEC's asseveration that the electorate of San 
Antonio, Zamhales was fully aware of Lonzanida's disqualification is 
purely speculative and conjectural."' No evidence was ever presented to 
prove the character of Lonzanida's disqualification particularly the 
fact that the voting populace was "fully aware in fact and in law" of 
Lonzanida's alleged disqualification as to "bring such awareness within 
the realm of notoriety," in other words, that the voters intentionally 
wasted their ballots knowing that, in spite of their voting for him, he 
was ineligible."
[27]
  Therefore, it is an error for the COMELEC to apply the exception in 
Labo
 when the operative facts upon which its application depends are wanting.




Finally,
 as regards the question on who should rightfully fill the permanent 
vacancy created in the office of the mayor, Section 44 of the LGC 
explicitly states:




Sec. 44. 
Permanent Vacancies in 
the Offices of the Governor, Vice-Governor, Mayor, and Vice-Mayor
. - If a 
permanent vacancy occurs in the office of the governor or mayor, the 
vice-governor or vice-mayor concerned shall become the governor or 
mayor, x x x.




The law is couched without 
equivocation. In the event that a vacancy is created in the office of 
the mayor, it is the duly-elected vice-mayor, petitioner Aratea in this 
case, who shall succeed as mayor.  Clearly then, the COMELEC gravely 
abused its discretion in disregarding the law and established 
jurisprudence governing succession to local elective position and 
proclaiming private respondent Antipolo, a defeated candidate who 
received the second highest number of votes, as Mayor of San Antonio, 
Zambales.




In view of the foregoing disquisitions, I respectfully vote to 
GRANT

 the petition.  Necessarily, the Order dated January 12, 2011 and 
Resolution dated February 2, 2011 issued by pub-lie respondent 
Commission on Elections in SPA No. 09-158 (DC) should be 
REVERSED and SET ASIDE
 and private respondent Estela D. Antipolo's proclamation should be 
ANNULLED
.
 Petitioner Efren Racel Aratea, being the duly-elected Vice-Mayor, 
should be proclaimed Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales pursuant to the rule
 on succession under Section AA of the Local Government Code of 1991.
