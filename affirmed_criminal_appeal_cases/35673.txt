[ G.R. No. 120387-88, March 31, 1998 ]


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. EDUARDO GARCIA Y DULAY, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


Affidavits of
desistance, especially those extracted from poor, unlettered, young and
gullible witnesses long after the trial is over, are generally frowned
upon.  Testimony solemnly given before a
court of justice and subjected to the test of cross-examination cannot just be
set aside, and a new trial granted on the basis of perfunctory and  
pro  forma 
  affidavits that
obviously were not prepared directly by the witnesses themselves but by some
legally trained individuals.  The
credibility of trials and the pursuit of truth cannot be placed at the
unilateral disposal of timorous witnesses or made dependent on one-sided
statements prepared by notaries.


The Case


The Court relies
upon this 
principium
 in resolving this appeal from the Decision
[1]
.  It was penned by Judge Lorenzo B. Veneracion, who also presided
over the trial.
1 of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch XLVII, convicting Appellant Eduardo
Garcia of two counts of rape and sentencing him to two terms of 
reclusion
perpetua
.  Appellant prays that he
âbe acquitted and/or the case be remanded to the lower court for reception of
newly discovered evidence.â
[2]


On January 6,
1993, Complainant Joylyn Garcia, accompanied and assisted by her sister Rowena
and aunt Librada Nuqui,
[3]
 lodged before the Manila Police a
complaint for rape against her father, Appellant Eduardo Garcia.


After
preliminary investigation, two separate Informations, docketed as Criminal Case
Nos. 93-114437 and 93-114438 and both dated January 8, 1993, were filed by
Assistant Prosecutor Ferrer S. Co charging appellant with rape.  The Information in Criminal Case No.
93-114437 reads:


âThat sometime in the
middle part of October 1992, in the city of Manila, Philippines, the said
accused, armed with a bladed weapon, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, with lewd designs have carnal knowledge of JOYLYN GARCIA Y NUQUI,
who is his daughter age 13 years, and by means of force, violence, threat and
intimidation, succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her, against her will
and consent.


CONTRARY
TO LAW.â
[4]


Except for the
date of the commission of the crime, the Information in Criminal Case No.
93-114438 was similar to the first:


âThat sometime in the 2nd
week of November 1992, in the city of Manila, Philippines, the said accused,
armed with a bladed weapon, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, with lewd designs have carnal knowledge of JOYLYN GARCIA Y NUQUI,
who is his daughter age 13 years, and by means of force, violence, threat and
intimidation, succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her, against her will
and consent.


CONTRARY
TO LAW.â
[5]


During
arraignment, accused-appellant, assisted by Counsel 
de Oficio
 Jesse
Tiburan, pleaded not guilty to both charges.
[6]
 The trial court consolidated the
two cases and, after due trial, promulgated on August 9, 1994 its assailed
Decision,
[7]
 the dispositive portion of which
reads:


âWHEREFORE, judgment is
hereby rendered finding [the] accused, Eduardo Garcia y Dulay, guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of rape on two counts and hereby sentences him to
suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua 
for each count of rape charged
in the Informations in these cases.


The accused is further
ordered to indemnify the victim, Joylyn Garcia y Nuqui the sum of 
P
100,000.00,
Philippine Currency.


SO
ORDERED.â
[8]


Hence, this
appeal.
[9]
 After the promulgation of the
assailed Decision, appellant filed before the trial court a motion for a new
trial.  In its order dated April 21,
1995, the court 
a quo
 held that âthe Motion for New Trial should be
addressed to the Supreme Court.â
[10]


The Facts


According to the Prosecution


In the
Appelleeâs Brief,
[11]
 dated May 30, 1996, the solicitor
general presented the prosecutionâs version of the case facts:


âThe victim, Joylyn Garcia,
a first year student at the Nolasco High School in Tondo, Manila, testified
that sometime in the middle of October, 1992, about 9:00 oâclock in the
evening, appellant Eduardo Garcia, her father, gave her medicine for her
illness.  At the time, Joylyn was lying
in bed (TSN, p. 3, February 9, 1993).


After Joylyn took the
medicine which caused her to sleep, appellant placed himself on top of Joylyn
and poked a pointed object on her right side.  Appellant then held her arms, spread her knees (legs) and inserted his
penis into her vagina.  Appellant remained
in that position for about three (3) minutes after which he left the
house.  After the incident, Joylyn
reported her ordeal to Librada Nuqui, her auntie (TSN, pp. 4-5, February 9,
1993).


Joylyn continued that
sometime in the second week of November, 1992, also in the evening, she was
again raped by her father when they were left alone in their house.  She likewise reported the incident to her
auntie (TSN, pp. 6-7, February 9, 1993).


The records show that after
the incidents were reported to the City Hall Detachment,  Joylyn was examined by Dr. Manuel Lagonera,
medico-legal officer of the Western Police District Command (WPDC).  His findings were contained in Report No.
WB-93-01 (Exh. âGâ) dated February 12, 1993, thus:


PHYSICAL AND
VAGINAL EXAMINATION REPORT GENERAL DATA:


âJoylyn N. Garcia, 13 years
old, single, presently residing at 362-B Sta. Isabel St., Bo. San Antonio,
Zaragosa, Tondo, Manila, consulted the medico-legal office on 5 January 1993 at
about 8:45 p.m. accompanied by aunt and sister for physical and vaginal
examination as requested by Chief Insp. Honorato Laurel of GAD, WPD.â


GENERAL
APPEARANCE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:


Fairly nourished and fairly
developed, conscious but incoherent.  Mentally unstable with slurred speech.


Breasts - Hemi-spherical in
shape with brownish nipples and areolae.


Abdomen - soft and flat
without strae [sic] of pregnancy.


Vaginal canal - admits one
examining finger with resistance and moist.


Hymen -
thin with circular opening and showed incomplete and superficial healed
laceration at 3:00 oâclock position with non-coaptable edges and not congested.


IMPRESSION/CONCLUSION:


Consistent with a girl who is no longer a virgin.â
[12]


Scenario of the Defense


The defense
claims that appellant did not commit the crime charged.  It also prays for a new trial for the
reception of newly discovered evidence consisting of the complainantâs
Affidavit of Desistance,
[13]
 in which she recanted her testimony
that she was raped by her father.  The
Appellantâs Brief
[14]
 narrates the facts as viewed by the
defense:


âTwo Informations for two
counts of rape were filed against the [a]ccused by his daughter, Joylyn
Garcia[,] allegedly committed [i]n the middle part of October 1992 and November
1992 in their residence in Tondo, Manila.


Complainant was assisted by
her sister, Rowena Garcia and her [a]untie, Librada Nuqui when they lodged a
complaint in the police detachment, at the ground floor of Manila City Hall
sometime on January 6, 1993.  Thereafter,
accused was arrested and until now, he is detained at the Muntinlupa
Penitentiary.


The wife (mother of
complainant), brother and grandmother of the complainant testified for the
[a]ccused while the sister, Rowena Garcia and their [a]untie, Librada Nuqui
initiated this criminal case.  There was
internal family feud, which furnishes the motive for this charge.


Complainant was a thirteen
(13) year old high school student at the time of the incident.  Beginning June 1992 up to November 11, 1992,
she was staying at the residence of her [a]untie.  (T.S.N. of Feb. 23, 1993, p. 7).  She was brought to their house on November 11, 1992 already in a state
of shock (tulala) and mumbling incoherently.  She was treated by a quack doctor.  Later[,] she mumbled that she was touched and was being threatened.  (Naagrabyado, T.S.N. of 2/23/95, p. 9).  Under the pitiful and pathetic situation,
the [a]ccused, together with his wife, brought their aforesaid daughter, Joylyn
Garcia to the hospital for psychiatric treatment (Exhibit â1â).


In December 1992, the mother
and wife of the [a]ccused brought their daughter to Phil. General Hospital for
treatment.  (Exhibit â2â, â3-Aâ, â3-Bâ).


For the prosecution,
[c]omplainant took the witness [stand] and the doctor who examined her.  (Exhibit âFâ and âF-1â).  For the defense, the [a]ccused denied that
he raped his own daughter.  The wife
testified for the [a]ccused and averred that they were sidewalk vendors in
Divisoria, Manila and usually arrived home together at about 8:00 p.m. or 9:00
p.m. and usually left at the wee hour of day at about 3:00 a.m.  The defense presented Dr. Agueda Sunga and
Dra. Anita Poblete of PGH who examined the accused and found her hymen to be
still intact.  The brother of the
[c]omplainant likewise testified that his father could not have raped his
sister.


After trial, Judge
Veneracion rendered the disputed decision finding the [a]ccused guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of two counts of rape.


While the case is on
appeal, [c]omplainant executed an Affidavit of Desistance dated November 25,
1995 before the undersigned counsel, recanting her previous testimony and
apologized for the grievous mistake in accusing her father.  In view of the recantation of said
complainant, [a]ccused filed a Motion for New Trial based on newly discovered
evidence but the lower court denied the said motion, contained [sic] in an
Order dated April 21, 1995 reasoning that âThe Court feels that the Motion for
New Trial should be addressed to the Supreme Court.â


This
[a]ppeal is interposed to reverse the finding of the lower court on the ground
that the guilt of the [a]ccused has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt,
and/or based on constitutional presumption of innocence which has not been
overcome especially in the light of the inconsistent testimony of the
complainant and her subsequent recantation.â
[15]


Joylyn Garciaâs
affidavit reads:


âAFFIDAVIT OF DESISTANCE


I, Joylyn Garcia, Filipino,
single, of legal age, with postal address at 362-B Sta. Isabel St., Barrio San
Antonio, Tondo, Manila, after being duly sworn, hereby depose under oath that:


1.
     
I am the complainant against my father, Eduardo Garcia for rape
under criminal case nos. 93-114437, 93-114438, RTC of Manila, Branch 47;


2.
     
I retract my previous testimony in court that I was raped twice by
my father, Eduardo Garcia sometime in October and November 1992.  
It is not true that my father, Eduardo
Garcia, raped me at our house.  I
apologize for the grievuous [sic] mistake in accusing my father
;


3.
     
The filing of the criminal case was upon instruction of my
[a]untie, Roselle Nuqui and my sister, Rowena Garcia.  At that time, I was still in shock and suffering from nervuous
[sic] breakdown.  I had no mind of my
own.  I testified in court pursuant to
what was dictated upon me by my said relatives.


4.
     
 This affidavit is executed to nullify the decision convicting
my father of the crime of rape and to set free my father who was innocent of
the crime of rape.


I execute this affidavit to
attest to the truth of the foregoing for whatever legal purpose it may serve.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto
set my hand this ___ day of October 1994 at Manila, Philippines.

JOYLYN GARCIA


Affiantâ
[16]


Issues


In his Brief,
appellant assigns the following âerrors committed by the lower courtâ:


âI.
     
The information is fatally defective as the same was not signed
or assisted by the parents;[sic]


II.
      
The accused should be acquitted as the constitutional
presumption of innocence has not been overcome;


III.
     
The alleged rape is [a] figment of imagination and is not
credible; and


IV.
    
New hearing should be held for [the]
reception of newly discovered evidence in view of the recantation of the
complainant.â
[17]


The Court, in
the interest of clarity, will combine the foregoing into two issues:


1.
     
Sufficiency of the complaint


2.
     
Sufficiency of the prosecution evidence and the effect of the
recantation.


The Courtâs Ruling


The appeal is
bereft of merit.  The affidavit of
desistance cannot be the basis for granting a new trial or an acquittal. 


First Issue:  
Sufficiency
of the Complaint


The defense
points out that when the complaint was lodged with the police by Complainant
Joylyn Garcia, the latter âwas not in full control of her mental faculties as
she was still then in a state of shock.â
[18]
 Because of Joylynâs condition at
the time, the complaint should have been filed by her parents.  Since it was the complainantâs aunt and
elder sister who âassistedâ her in filing the complaint, appellant posits that
the regional trial court acquired no jurisdiction over the case.
 
[19]


We are not
persuaded.  Complainant Joylyn Garcia
may have been mentally distressed, but she was not proven to be legally
incapacitated.  In the presence of PO3
Fidel Geronimo, she was able to personally sign her 
Salaysay
 or
affidavit showing her ravishment.  In
said 
Salaysay
, she answered the police officerâs questions on why she
was there, stating that she was raped by her own father.
[20]
 It was only thereafter that she was
assisted by Rowena Garcia, her sister, in narrating how the rape was committed.
[21]
 At any rate,  a person is presumed to be in control of his
or her faculties.  Whoever alleges
otherwise has the burden of proof.  Aside from his bare allegations, appellant presented no convincing
evidence that complainant was legally incapacitated by reason of her mental
state when she filed her complaint.  Accordingly, it becomes immaterial that only her aunt and elder sister,
who were not her guardians, assisted her.  Section 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court, clearly provides that she
could have filed the complaint on her own, 
viz.
:


âxxx The offended party,
even if she were a minor, has the right to initiate the prosecution for the
above offenses, independently of her parents, grandparents or guardians, unless
she is incompetent or incapable of doing so upon grounds other than her
minority. xxxâ


Second Issue:  
Sufficiency
of Prosecution Evidence


After a thorough
review of the evidence presented 
during
 the trial, we hold that the
trial court did not err in convicting appellant.  Joylyn Garcia testified that she was twice raped by her own
father, as shown by salient portions of her February 9, 1993 testimony:


âPUBLIC PROS.:

A.:
  
I
cannot remember, sir.


Q.:

said that the first time you were raped by your father was in the middle part
of October.  After October, 1992, did
your father again rape you or have sexual intercourse with you?


A.:

Q.:
  
Would

Do
you still remember what time of the day it happened?


A.:
  
In the evening, sir.â
[22]


The foregoing
testimony, by itself, is sufficient to overcome the presumption of
innocence.  Indeed, âwhen an alleged
victim of rape says that she was violated, she says in effect all that is
necessary to show that the rape has been inflicted on her and so long as her
testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the
basis thereof.â
[23]
 Moreover,  the trial court itself gave full credence to the said
testimony.  Well-settled is the rule
that the trial courtâs assessment of the credibility of witnesses is conclusive
and binding on appellate courts.
[24]
 We find no reason to disregard the
trial courtâs evaluation of young Joylynâs testimony.  


We are not
persuaded by appellantâs insistent denial, which is a weak defense that is easy
to fabricate.  It failed to overcome
Joylynâs testimony during trial which identified him as the perpetrator of two
counts of rape.  


Appellant also
cites other circumstances which allegedly negate the commission of rape:  


1.
 
â[I]t
is contrary to human experience that a mother will be so callous and uncaring as
to allow the second rape to be committed on her daughter.â


2.
 
A
family feud existed between the accused and Librada Nuqui by reason of their
quarrel over a market stall.


3.
 
The
family abode is located in a crowded squatter area and it is thus âimprobable
that the crime charged could have been committed without being noticed by the
neighbors.â


4.
 
Joylynâs
testimony is inconsistent and incredible because in her 
Salaysay
 âshe
omitted to mention that she was given medicine by her fatherâ and, when queried
during cross-examination on this omission, she could not give an adequate
explanation, stating instead that her father threatened her with a pointed
object.


5.
 
Although
appellantâs wife testified that she and her husband usually left and returned
home together, Joylyn did not explain why she was home alone with appellant
during the alleged rape.


6.
 
From
June to November 11, 1992, complainant stayed in the house of Librada Nuqui,
but she was already 
tulala
 when she returned home.


7.
 
âThe alleged rape is not supported by the
physical evidence on record,â because of Dr. Pobleteâs finding of an intact
hymen and testimony that there was no penetration â(e)ven if there has been
actual contact.â
 
[25]


The foregoing
appear to have been raised  
faute de
mieux
 and do not detract from the correctness of the trial courtâs factual
finding and conclusion. 


The allegation
that the mother could not have allowed her daughter to be raped a second time
has no factual basis.  The record
reveals no indication that the mother had any knowledge of either the first or
the second rape.  It appears that Joylyn
never reported the first incident of rape to her mother.  Significantly, Joylyn intimated the atrocity
to her aunt (Librada Nuqui) and not to her mother.
[26]
 


Moreover, it is
implausible that, for a mere squabble over a market stall,
[27]
 Librada Nuqui would allow Joylyn to
suffer the untold difficulties and humiliation attendant on a rape prosecution
if the accusation were not true.  It
must be noted that Librada took Joylyn Garcia home and cared for her; in
return, Joylyn showered her with a love greater than that which she gave to her
parents.
[28]
 


Neither does the
crime scene render the commission of the crime impossible.  This Court has held that rape âcan be
committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the roadside,
within school premises and even inside a house where there are other occupants
or where other members of the family are also sleeping.  Lust is no respecter of time and place.â
[29]
 


Appellant raises
too much ado over the failure of Joylyn to mention in her 
Salaysay
 that
her father gave her some medicine before he raped her, a detail found however
in her testimony.  This omission merely
shows that her sworn statement was incomplete, but it does not detract from the
overall veracity of her testimony.
[30]
 The lapse in her sworn statement
was consistent with her mental stress at the time of its execution.


We also find
pointless appellantâs insistence that, in view of the testimony of his wife
that she and her husband usually left and returned home together, the victim
should have explained why she was alone with him during the alleged rape.  Such explanation is immaterial.  The prosecutionâs duty is to prove that the
accused committed the crime, not to explain a circumstance of insignificant
relevance.  As earlier observed, the
prosecution successfully discharged this burden.


Equally
pointless is appellantâs allegation that the victim stayed in the house of
Librada Nuqui from June to November 11, 1992 and was already 
tulala
 when
she returned.  Appellant, however, is
not here arguing that the victim never set foot inside the 
locus criminis

during the period in question.  On the
other hand, Joylyn did testify that, in two instances, her father raped her
inside their house.


Likewise, we
cannot sustain appellantâs argument that the physical evidence did not support
the alleged rape.  The medical expert
for the prosecution testified that there were hymenal lacerations.  Although this was rebutted by Dr. Poblete
who appeared for the defense, it must be emphasized that hymenal laceration is
not an element of rape.  It is
sufficient that there was sexual congress, and that this was consummated by the
slightest introduction of the male organ into the labia of the pudendum.
[31]


On the basis of
the evidence presented during trial, the trial court was justified in
concluding that appellant committed the crime charged.  After the promulgation of the assailed
Decision, however, herein appellant presented a ânewly discovered evidenceâ and
prayed that a new trial be conducted.  In view of the pendency of this appeal, the trial court held that the
matter should be addressed to this Court.  We shall now resolve it.  


Recantation and Motion for New Trial


On February 27,
1995, during the pendency of this appeal to this Court, the defense filed
before the trial court a timely Motion for New Trial on the basis of an
Affidavit of Desistance executed by Complainant Joylyn Garcia on November 25,
1994.  Such motion was filed under  Sec. 2, Rule 121 of the Rules of Court,
which  provides:


âSec. 2.  
Grounds for a new trial
. -- The court
shall grant a new trial on any of the following grounds:


   
(a)
       
That
errors of law or irregularities have been committed during the trial
prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused;


   
(b)
       
That
new and material evidence has been discovered which the accused could not with
reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial, and which if
introduced and admitted, would probably change the judgment.â


When confronted
with an affidavit of recantation, courts are called upon to weigh
countervailing values in our legal and judicial system.  A recantation, as a general rule, is not
sufficient to warrant a new trial.  If
it were otherwise, a new trial would be granted whenever an interested party
succeeds in intimidating or inducing any or some of the witnesses to retract
after trial their testimony, thus, opening the door to endless litigation.  It is also injudicious to reject a testimony
solely on the basis of such recantation, which may later be repudiated, as this
âwill make a solemn trial a mockery and place the investigation at the mercy of
unscrupulous witnesses.â
[32]
 Thus, the Court in 
People vs.
Junio
[33]
 
held:


âThe appellantâs submission
that the execution of an Affidavit of Desistance by complainant who was
assisted by her mother supported the âinherent incredibility of prosecutionâs
evidenceâ is specious.  We have said in
so many cases that retractions are generally unreliable and are looked upon
with considerable disfavor by the courts.  The unreliable character of this document is shown by the fact that it
is quite incredible that after going through the process of having
accused-appellant arrested by the police, positively identifying him as the
person who raped her, enduring the humiliation of a physical examination of her
private parts, and then repeating her accusation in open court by recounting
her anguish, Maryjane would suddenly turn around and declare that â[a]fter a
careful deliberation over the case, (she) find(s) that the same does not merit
or warrant criminal prosecution.â


Thus, we have declared that
at most the retraction is an afterthought which should not be given probative
value.  It would be a dangerous rule to
reject the testimony taken before the court of justice simply because the
witness who has given it later on changed his mind for one reason or
another.  Such a rule will make a solemn
trial a mockery and place the investigation at the mercy of unscrupulous
witnesses.  Because affidavits of
retraction can easily be secured from poor and ignorant witnesses, usually for
monetary consideration, the Court has invariably regarded such affidavits as
exceedingly unreliable.â


To warrant a new
trial, Joylynâs affidavit of desistance must constitute a recantation and not a
mere withdrawal from the prosecution of the case.  The Court 
en banc
 in 
Alonte,
[34]
 speaking through Mr. Justice Jose
C. Vitug, held that the complainantâs affidavit of desistance did not
constitute a recantation, because she did not deny the truth of her complaint
but merely sought to âbe allowed to withdrawâ and âdiscontinueâ  the  case  because  she  wished  âto  start life anew and live normally
again.â  She never absolved or
exculpated the accused.  In other words,
a recantation of a prior statement or testimony must necessarily renounce the
said statement or testimony and withdraw it formally and publicly.
[35]
 


Although the
affidavit of Joylyn states that â[i]t is not true that my father, Eduardo Garcia,
raped me at our house,â it is bereft of details or any other badge of
credibility, not to say of truth.  Such
a statement is not sufficient; it is merely a legal conclusion that could not
have come directly from the mouth of this young girl.  More likely, it was prepared by a legal mind and presented to the
complainant already typed and signature-ready.  In comparison with the unpretentious, candid, detailed and credible
testimony of Joylyn quoted earlier in this Decision, the affidavit crumbles into
a desperate clutch at straws.  It is not
the withdrawal or recantation or exculpation that the law considers sufficient
to overturn the overwhelming evidence earlier given during the trial.


Experience has
taught us that it is not difficult to get the signatures of poor, unlettered
and gullible witnesses in strangely worded and difficult to decipher legalese
contained in affidavits of desistance.  In the words of Mme. Justice Ameurfina A. Melencio-Herrera:


âx x x
affidavits of recantation can easily be secured from poor and ignorant
witnesses for monetary consideration or through intimidation.  Recanted testimony is exceedingly
unreliable, for there is always the probability that it may later be
repudiated.  Courts thus look with
disfavor at affidavits of retractions of testimony given in open court, and are
wary or reluctant to allow a new trial based on retracted testimony.  Indeed, it would be a dangerous rule to
reject the testimony taken before the court of justice simply because the
witness later on changed his mind for one reason or another, for such a rule
will make a solemn trial a mockery and will place the investigation of truth at
the mercy of unscrupulous witnesses.
[36]


In the case at
bar, Joylyn executed her affidavit of desistance (1) about one year and nine
months after she voluntarily and solemnly gave her testimony before the trial
court, and (2) more than ten months after the judgment of conviction was
promulgated.  This Court is inclined to
give credence and faith to this girlâs straightforward, detailed and consistent
testimony rather than to the brief, perfunctory, 
pro forma
 and highly
suspect affidavit of desistance which obviously did not emanate directly from
her mouth but was merely prepared for her adherence.  âIt is absurd to disregard a testimony that has undergone trial
and scrutiny by the court and the parties simply because an affidavit
withdrawing the testimony is subsequently presented by the defense.â
[37]
 It is simply inconceivable that
Joylyn, a naive thirteen-year-old girl would falsely accuse her own father of
rape and wreak havoc on their family unless her solitary goal is to âbring to
justice the satyr whose beastliness [is] the cause of her loss of virginity at
a tender age.â
[38]
 Unarguably, her affidavit of
desistance -- executed after the completion of the trial and the promulgation
of the judgment of conviction -- has no probative value
[39]
 and cannot be the  basis for granting a new trial or an
acquittal.


WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
DENIED
 and
the assailed Decision finding Eduardo Garcia guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
two counts of rape, sentencing him to two terms of 
reclusion perpetua

and ordering him to pay indemnity of 
P
100,000 is 
AFFIRMED
.  Costs against appellant.
