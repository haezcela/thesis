CARPIO MORALES, J.:


On appeal is the May 5, 1995 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5, Baguio City convicting herein appellants Evelyn Patayek y Calag and Arlene Goya y Taya for violation of Section 4, Article II, of Republic Act 6425 (âThe Dangerous Drugs Actâ), as amended by Republic Act 7659.
The Information dated November 21, 1994 charged appellants as follows:
The undersigned accuses EVELYN PATAYEK Y CALAG and ARLENE GOYA Y TAYA of the crime of VIOLATION OF SECTION IV, ARTICLE II OF R.A. 6425 AS AMENDED BY R.A. 7659, committed as follows:
That on or about the 18
th
 day of November, 1994, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually aiding one another, did then and there willfully (,) unlawfully and feloniously sell and deliver approximately three (3) kilos of suspected marijuana dried leaves with flowering tops wrapped with newspaper pages and light brown masking tape placed in a black travelling bag with yellow strap, a prohibited drug, well knowing that the sale and delivery of such drug is prohibited without authority of law to do so, in violation of the aforementioned provisions of law.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
[1]
When arraigned on January 24, 1995, appellants pleaded not guilty.
[2]
From the testimonies of SPO1 Modesto Carrera and forensic chemist Police Senior Inspector Alma Margarita D. Villasenor, the prosecution established the following version:
On November 18, 1994, around 1:00 p.m., a male concerned citizen reported to Chief Inspector Jose Dayco at the 14th Narcotics Command (NARCOM) Regional Field Office, Baguio City the engagement by two women whom he referred to as Arlene and Evelyn in the sale of marijuana.
[3]
 Dayco at once formed a team to conduct a buy-bust operation on the two.
[4]
Carrera was designated as poseur-buyer and was handed marked money consisting of four one hundred peso (
P
100.00) bills in the total amount of 
P
400.00 in which were sandwiched 20 pieces of boodle money which were cut out from light brown paper.
[5]
Around 3:30 p.m. of the same day, the team, which was headed by Dayco, together with the concerned citizen, proceeded to the vicinity of Bermuda Hills, Naguilian Road, Baguio City.
On arrival at the Bermuda Hills, Carrera and the concerned citizen posted themselves in front of its gate while the others posted themselves at a distance of around 20 meters.
[6]
Around 30 to 40 minutes later, appellants arrived. Appellant Evelyn approached the concerned citizen who introduced her to Carrera as a big time buyer of marijuana from Manila.
Carrera thereupon informed Evelyn that he was interested in buying 3 kilos of marijuana. Evelyn inquired from Carrera if he had the money and he replied in the affirmative. Evelyn then told Carrera to wait as she approached Arlene who was 10 meters away and who gave her a black bag with yellow strap.
[7]
 Appellants then repaired to where Carrera and the concerned citizen were.
[8]
Upon receiving the black bag, Carrera opened it and on ascertaining that it contained marijuana, he handed over the buy-bust money to Arlene and gave the pre-arranged âthumbs-upâ signal to the other members of the team.
[9]
The team members thereupon rushed to the scene of the transaction and arrested appellants from whom Carrera recovered the money. Appellants were brought to the NARCOM Regional Field Office where Carrera prepared a receipt
[10]
 of the 3 bricks of marijuana weighing 1 kilo each
[11]
 which were wrapped in newspaper and placed inside a black bag with yellow strap, and of the 4 pieces of 
P
100.00 bills.
Carrera also prepared a request for laboratory examination
[12]
 of the 3 bricks which he submitted to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory Service at Camp Dangwa, La Trinidad, Benguet.
By the account of the PNP forensic chemist Alma Margarita, all 3 bricks which were subjected to physical, chemical and confirmatory tests
[13]
 were positive for marijuana.
[14]
Appellants denied the accusation and proffered that they were framed up. They claimed that on November 18, 1995, Arlene visited Evelyn, a tupperware dealer, at her house. On Arleneâs suggestion, the two proceeded, at around 10 a.m., to the house of Arleneâs sister Mila Abdol who might be interested to buy tupperware, bringing with them a dozen tumblers. Appellants stayed in Milaâs house up to 5:00 p.m. when they decided to go home.
[15]
While appellants were on their way to get a ride at the highway, they saw a man picking up a bag under a tree. As the man looked at them in a strange manner, they walked faster. The man followed them, however, and as they reached the highway, a red passenger jeep with approximately ten men on board pulled over in front of them. Two of the men forced them to board the jeep and attributed ownership of the black bag to them, which they denied. A man wearing a bonnet then took the money inside Evelynâs belt bag, prompting appellants to ask for its return, but the men hit them in their heads and ordered them to keep quiet.
[16]
Upon reaching Burnham Park, the men drew their guns and threatened to salvage them as they proceeded to the NARCOM Regional Field Office. The men shouted at them and forced them to take hold of the marijuana. They then were asked to produce âmoreâ money if they wanted to be released, but they maintained their innocence of the âaccusationâ against them.
[17]
The trial court convicted appellants by the assailed decision
[18]
 of May 5, 1995, the dispositive portion of which reads, quoted 
verbatim
:
WHEREFORE, the Court finds and declares the accused EVELYN PATAYEK y CALAG and ARLENE GOYA y TAYA guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of illegal sale and delivery of three (3) kilos of marijuana as charged and hereby 
sentences EACH of them to suffer an indeterminate penalty
 of TWENTY (20) YEARS of 
reclusion temporal
, as minimum, to FORTY (40) YEARS of 
reclusion perpetua
, as maximum, to pay a fine of P 500,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment and to pay their proportionate shares in the costs.
In the service of their sentence the accused shall be credited with their respective preventive imprisonment under the terms and conditions prescribed in Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.
The confiscated marijuana (Exhibits âCâ and âDâ) and their container (Exhibit âBâ) are declared forfeited in favor of the Government and upon the finality of this decision, the Branch Clerk of Court shall turn over the same to the Dangerous Drugs Custodian (NBI) for disposition in accordance with law.
Pursuant to Circular No. 4-92-A of the Court Administrator, the Warden of the City Jail of the Baguio is directed to immediately transfer the same accused to the custody of the Bureau of Corrections, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila.
Let a copy of this Decision be furnished the Warden of the City Jail of Baguio for his information and guidance.
SO ORDERED. (Emphasis supplied; underscoring in the original.)
Hence, the present appeal, appellants contending that the trial court erred:
in not finding the evidence of the prosecution weak and full of inconsistencies;
in giving full credence to the testimony of SPO1 Modesto Carrera despite his proven lack of credibility;
in shifting burden to the accused to prove their innocence;
in not acquitting the accused for the failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
[19]
This Court finds appellantsâ appeal bereft of merit.
In every prosecution, the guilt of the accused has to be established invariably by proof beyond reasonable doubt. The elements of the crime must be shown to exist and be adequately proven.
[20]
Two basic elements for the charge of sale of prohibited drugs to prosper are: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and payment therefor.
[21]
Contrary to appellantsâ assertion, the prosecution has proven the elements of the crime charged. The object of the sale was found by the PNP chemist positive for marijuana. The buy-bust money was recovered from them after the transaction.
All the elements of the crime were in fact established through Carreraâs testimony, the material portions of which are as follows:

Appellants, however, assail the credibility of Carreraâs testimony as not straightforward, they claiming that he even appeared reluctant to testify in court and had, along with other NARCOM operatives, the propensity to fabricate cases.
[23]
While the trial court observed that Carrera âhas time and again given himself away as clumsy in testifying,â it nevertheless held that âsuch detracts nothing from the core of the testimony he has given in the case at bench which exonerably points to the guilt of the accused.â
[24]
Appellantsâ defense that they were merely framed-up does not thus persuade. It bears emphasis that frame-up as a defense has been invariably viewed with disfavor, for it can easily be concocted and is a common standard defense ploy in most prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act.
[25]
 That is why clear and convincing evidence is required to prove the defense
[26]
 which, in appellantsâ case, they failed to discharge.
Absent any proof of intent on the part of the police authorities to falsely impute such a serious crime against appellants, the presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duty, as well as the doctrine that findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect, must prevail over the self-serving and uncorroborated claim of appellants that they had been framed-up.
[27]
As correctly observed by the trial court:
[T]he claim of the accused that a man merely picked up the travelling bag containing the contraband from under a tree is too fantastic to merit belief. In fact, Mila Abdol, the sister of Arlene, did not even bother to come forward to bear out the allegation of the accused that they then came from her house where they sold her Tupperware
 products worth 
P
2,000.00. It is also very unrealistic for Carrera to say that the prohibited drug came from the accused if that were not the case. 
For why should Carrera target them, among all people, and subject them to a trumped-up charge. They have not pointed out any reason why they should specially be chosen for such a nefarious operation. And why should Carrera use such a large quantity of the stuff if he were out only to machinate and plant evidence on the accused? A smaller quantity would have sufficed and the rest reserved for planting on another victim

A word on the penalty imposed by the trial court. The trial court divided 
reclusion perpetua
[29]
 into three periods and accordingly applied the Indeterminate Sentence Law. While Section 17 of Republic Act 7659, which amended âThe Dangerous Drugs Act,â fixed the duration of 
reclusion perpetua
 from 20 years and 1 day to 40 years, there was no clear legislative intent to alter its classification as an indivisible penalty, hence, it remains as such.
[30]
WHEREFORE
, the May 5, 1995 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, First Judicial Region, Branch 5, Baguio City convicting appellants Evelyn Patayek and Arlene Goya of violation of Section 4 of Republic Act 6425, as amended by Republic Act 7659, is hereby 
AFFIRMED 
with 
MODIFICATION 
in that appellants are sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, and to each pay a Fine of 
P
500,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.
Costs against appellants.
