The herein accused committed the crime with the aggravating

Upon being arraigned on June 24, 1996, appellant Simeon B. Cruz, assisted by counsel 
de oficio
, entered the plea of âNot guiltyâ in each of these cases.  Thereafter, joint trial on the merits ensued.

The evidence of the prosecution shows that one Wednesday evening,
 in the third week of August, 1994, the appellant, Simeon Cruz, arrived 
home in Barangay Poblacion, Gen. Natividad, Nueva Ecija heavily drunk.  
The private complainant, Vanessa S. Cruz, who was then sleeping on the 
second floor of the house with her younger sister, Lorraine, woke up and
 went downstairs when called by her father from the masterâs bedroom 
which was located on the groundfloor.  Simeon ordered Vanessa to enter 
the room but the latter refused thus, he pulled her and locked the door.
[2]


Simeon poked a knife on the lower right ear of his daughter and 
ordered her to undress.  After having undressed, Simeon, who was already
 naked from waist down, removed Vanessaâs underwear and proceeded to 
kiss her breast and other private parts.  Vanessa pleaded for him to 
stop inasmuch as she was his daughter, but in vain.  Simeon continued 
kissing her body and placed himself on top of her.  Vanessa cried in 
pain when her father inserted his penis into her vagina and made push 
and pull motions.
[3]


Vanessa was raped by her father again in the second week of 
November 1994.  Simeon called his children namely:  Vanessa, Lorraine 
and Mark Ian from the masterâs bedroom at past 12:00 oâclock midnight.  
After the three (3) had entered the room, Simeon instructed Lorraine and
 Mark Ian to step out and leave Vanessa alone with him.  Simeon locked 
the door and removed his clothes before undressing his daughter.  
Vanessa cried and asked her father why he was doing such thing when she 
was her daughter, but Simeon did not respond.  Instead, he laid Vanessa 
in bed and kissed her.  Then he instructed her to stand, hold his penis 
and place the same into her mouth.  He also instructed his daughter to 
masturbate his penis.  Subsequently, he laid her again in bed and kissed
 her private parts before finally entering her.  Thereafter, Simeon 
threatened Vanessa with death, including her maternal grandmother, if 
she would report the incident.
[4]


The last incident of rape happened in the third week of November,
 1994 after Simeon arrived home late in the evening heavily drunk.  He 
took Vanessa from upstairs, where she was sleeping together with her 
brothers and sister, and brought her into the masterâs bedroom at the 
ground floor.  Simeon removed her bra, then her pair of shorts and 
panty.  He then kissed her private parts even though she was crying.  
Vanessa told him to stop but Simeon proceeded to remove his clothes and 
continued kissing her breast.  Thereafter, he went on top of her and 
inserted his penis into her vagina causing her intense pain.
[5]


Vanessa disclosed that her mother, Marlyn S. Cruz, went to Hong 
Kong on November 12, 1991 to work as a domestic helper.  Since then, 
Vanessa and her siblings namely: Michael (14), Lorraine (9) and Mark Ian
 (4) had been living with their father in Barangay Poblacion, Gen. 
Natividad, Nueva Ecija.  Her maternal grandmother, Felicidad Santiago, 
also moved in their house to keep them company.
[6]

 However, her grandmother was not always in the house inasmuch as the 
latter would be away twice a week or, at times for three (3) straight 
days in a week, to stay in her house in Mataas na Kahoy, Gen. Natividad,
 Nueva Ecija, which is about three (3) kilometers away from their house.
[7]


On March 26, 1996, Simeon arrived home at around 4:00 oâclock in 
the afternoon heavily drunk.  He dragged Vanessa, who was then watching 
the television together with her grandmother at the sala, into the 
masterâs bedroom.  Simeon locked the door, and this time even placed a 
nail to secure it.  He covered the windows before he began kissing his 
daughter.  Vanessa protested and told her father to better kill her.  
Infuriated, Simeon hit her in the stomach and bumped her head four (4) 
times against the wall.  Apparently not contented, Simeon got hold of a 
hammer and swung it against her daughter hitting her in the jaw.
[8]


Aware of what was happening, Felicidad hurried to the house where
 Simeon had come from drinking, to request Julian Ibarra to intercede 
and pacify his kumpadre.  Had it not been for the timely arrival of 
Julian, Simeon would have again succeeded in molesting his daughter.
[9]


On the same day, Vanessa and her siblings were brought by 
Felicidad to her house in Mataas na Kahoy, Gen. Natividad, Nueva Ecija. 
 For the first time, Vanessa revealed to her grandmother the bestial 
acts committed by her father against her.

On March 28, 1996, Vanessa was accompanied by her grandmother to 
the NBI office in Cabanatuan City to lodge a complaint for rape against 
her father.  After taking her sworn statement on April 30, 1996, the NBI
 authorities in Cabanatuan City arrested the appellant on May 1, 1996.
[10]


The physical examination conducted by Dra. Lucila Gatchalian, 
M.D. on Vanessa at the Dr. Paulino J. Garcia Memorial Research and 
Medical Center in Cabanatuan City on April 30, 1996, shows the following
 findings:



NOI -- alleged rape 
      

      POI -- in their own house, Pob., Gen. Nat., N. E. 
      

      DOI âsince she is (sic) years old, âtill March 27, 1996 

      TOI â anytime 


Patient came accompanied by her maternal grandmother.
  


General Survey:  conscious, coherent, ambulatory with the following vital signs:
  


BP â 100/70; Temp. â 36 c; PR â75/min.; RR â 20/min. 

      LMP â April 25, 1996 menarche 13 years old. 

      HEENT â pinkish palpebral conjunctive. 

      Breast â well-developed pinkish areola, no nipple discharge. 

      Abdomen â flat, soft, no mass palpable. 

      Pelvic examination â scanty pubic hair, well coaptated labia minora, whitish mucoid discharge was noted in the introitus.

      IE â admits 1 finger with slight difficulty. 

      Lab. Result â no spermatozoa seen.
[11]






Dra. Lucila Gatchalian identified her signature appearing on the 
lower right portion of the medical certificate and affirmed the medical 
findings contained therein.  Dra. Gatchalian recalled that Vanessa was 
crying and afraid when she came to the hospital on April 30, 1996 for 
physical examination.  The three (3) healed hymenal lacerations 
sustained by Vanessa which are respectively indicated in the medical 
certificate as 5 oâclock, 8 oâclock and 11 oâclock may have been caused 
by the penetration of any hard object which could be an erect penis.
[12]

 Internal examination reveals that the introitus or vaginal opening of 
the patient admitted one (1) finger with slight difficulty.
[13]


Appellant Simeon B. Cruz vehemently denied in court any liability
 for the crimes charged in the three (3) informations.  Simeon claimed 
that his mother-in-law was behind the filing of the instant charges by 
his own daughter against him allegedly due to a long standing quarrel 
over money.  Simeon disclosed that he worked in Taiwan as a factory 
worker from June 30, 1995 to November 15, 1995.  During the said period,
 he sent money to his mother-in-law through the BPI Family Bank, 
Cabanatuan City branch, in the total amount of P10,000.00 to redeem 
their mortgaged property for the same amount.  In addition, his 
mother-in-law received from him the amount of P15,000.00 which he sent 
her through his brother, Claudio Cruz, who returned to the Philippines 
from Taiwan on October 20, 1995.  Upon his arrival to the Philippines in
 November 1995, Simeon learned that their property remained mortgaged.  
He confronted his mother-in-law that led to an altercation.  In the 
process he hurled a glass hitting her in the right arm.  Since then, the
 two seldom talked.
[14]


On March 26, 1996, Simeon attended the birthday party of his 
kumpadre, Juanito Torres, at the latterâs house at 1:00 oâclock in the 
afternoon.  At around 4:00 oâclock in the afternoon, his youngest son 
arrived at the house of Juanito Torres to inform Simeon that they were 
going to Mataas na Kahoy with their grandmother.  Simeon excused himself
 and went home with his son to see them go.  After his mother-in-law and
 the kids, namely: Vanessa, Lorraine and Mark Ian had left, Simeon and 
Julian Ibarra, who earlier came to fetch him, went back to the birthday 
party.  Simeon stayed at the party until 2:00 oâclock in the following 
morning.
[15]


On March 28, 1996, Simeon went to Mataas na Kahoy, Gen. 
Natividad, Nueva Ecija to fetch his children from the house of his 
mother-in-law.  Having been informed that they had gone to Cabanatuan 
City, he requested his sister, Maria Garcia, to go to  the house of his 
brother-in-law, Orlando Santiago, in Cabanatuan City to inquire about 
his children.  At the house of Orlando Santiago, Maria was informed that
 her nephew and nieces had transferred together with their grandmother 
to an ex-policeman relative, a certain Rene Bernado, who lived also in 
the city.
[16]


On May 1, 1996 at around 6:00 oâclock in the morning, Simeon was 
arrested in his house by NBI agents and was brought to the NBI stockade 
in Cabanatuan City.  Simeon was allegedly mauled by the arresting NBI 
agents when he refused to admit having raped his daughter, Vanessa.  He 
presented a medical certificate to show that he suffered contusions on 
his body.
[17]


Three (3) days after his arrest, the inquest fiscal of Cabanatuan
 City ordered the release of Simeon and required him to file his 
counter-affidavits.  From Cabanatuan City, Simeon proceeded to the house
 of his sister, Maria Garcia, in Angeles City, Pampanga for fear of his 
life.  While thereat, he was able to talk to his wife, Marlyn Cruz, 
through an overseas call to Hong Kong.   He requested Marlyn to come 
home and help him solve their domestic problems.  However, Marlynâs 
live-in partner in Hong Kong allegedly would not allow her.
[18]


Simeon disclosed that he knew his wife had a live-in partner in 
Hong Kong.  Marlyn allegedly informed him of her extra-marital affair 
when the latter went home to the Philippines on November 30, 1995 and 
explained that she did it to retain her employment in Hong Kong for the 
sake of their children.  Simeon initially protested but later on agreed 
after Marlyn promised to come home for good when she had enough savings.
[19]


Simeon was again arrested by NBI agents on June 6, 1996 at the 
Gapan-Olongapo highway while he was on his way to file additional 
counter-affidavit with the fiscal in Cabanatuan City in connection with 
these cases.
[20]


Meanwhile, on December 25, 1996, Simeonâs mother-in-law, 
Felicidad Santiago, together with his youngest son, Mark Ian, visited 
Simeon at the provincial jail of Nueva Ecija.  Felicidad allegedly told 
Simeon that the rape cases filed in court against him may be settled 
amicably provided he paid P100,000.00.  Simeon refused for the reason 
that he did not commit the charges in these cases.
[21]


Claudio Cruz corroborated Simeonâs testimony that the latter sent
 P10,000.00 to his mother-in-law, Felicidad Santiago, from Taiwan.  
Claudio testified that he was working in Taiwan at the time his brother,
 Simeon, went there to work in the factory.  Upon his return to the 
Philippines in October 1995, Claudio proceeded to the house of Simeon in
 Barangay Poblacion, Gen. Natividad, Nueva Ecija and gave to Felicidad 
Santiago the amount of P10,000.00  per instruction of his brother who 
remained in Taiwan.
[22]


Another defense witness, Fernando Marcelo, BPI Family Bank, 
Cabanatuan City branch employee identified in court the pertinent 
records
[23]
of the bank which 
show that Felicidad Santiago withdrew from the Account No. S.A. 
5233060005 of Simeon Cruz, with the same bank in Cabanatuan City, the 
total amount of P11,299.00 on September 7, 1995, and twice on October 9,
 1995. 

Additionally, Julian Ibarra testified that Simeon was one of the 
guests in the birthday party of Juanito Torres on March 26, 1996.  
Julian and Simeon drank liquor with the other guests in the house of 
Juanito Torres in Barangay Poblacion, Gen. Natividad, Nueva Ecija.  At 
4:00 oâclock in the afternoon, Simeon went home upon being fetched by 
his youngest son but promised to return.  After thirty (30) minutes, 
Julian followed Simeon in his house, which was about three hundred (300)
 meters away, where he saw Felicidad Santiago at the doorway.  Julian 
did not notice the appearance of Vanessa who was sitting with Lorraine 
inside the sala.  He merely called for Simeon from the outside and the 
two of them returned to the birthday party.
[24]


On rebuttal, Felicidad Santiago testified that she brought Mark 
Ian to the provincial jail of Nueva Ecija on December 25, 1996 upon the 
request of his father.  Felicidad denied having influenced Vanessa to 
file any complaint against her father nor proposed to Simeon the 
settlement of the instant criminal cases for a consideration.  She 
admitted having received from Simeon the total amount of P8,000.00 which
 the latter sent from Taiwan in 1995 for his children.  However, she 
denied having received any instruction from him to apply the said amount
 to redeem their property.
[25]


Thereafter, the trial court rendered a decision the dispositive portion of which is quoted hereunder, to wit:



PREMISES CONSIDERED, and finding the accused Simeon B. Cruz guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt of rape in each of the three (3) cases, is 
hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of:
  


  DEATH in Criminal Case No. 6970-AF and to indemnify the offended
 party in the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as moral 
damages and Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) Pesos as exemplary damages; 
  DEATH in Criminal Case No. 6971-AF and to pay the offended party
 the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos also as moral and 
Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) Pesos as exemplary damages; 
  DEATH in Criminal Case No. 6972-AF and to finally indemnify also
 the offended party in another amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) 
Pesos as moral and Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) Pesos as exemplary 
damages; and 
  To pay the costs of suit. 




In his Appellantâs Brief,
[26]
 appellant Simeon Cruz interposed the following assignment of errors, to wit:



I
  


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED ON A TESTIMONY THAT IS HIGHLY DUBIOUS AND INCREDIBLE; AND
  


II
  


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED DESPITE LACK OF INCULPATORY EVIDENCE.
  




Appellant Simeon Cruz characterized the instant criminal charges of 
rape against him as pure lies (kasinungalingan) which were allegedly 
conceived maliciously by his mother-in-law who had an axe to grind 
against him.  He averred that Vanessa went about her daily routine even 
after each of the alleged sexual abuses were committed against her.  She
 did not disclose the same despite opportunities to do so nor take any 
initiative to prevent a repetition thereof.  In fact, her grandmother 
did not suspect anything wrong had happened.  The medical certificate 
which was issued by Dra. Lucila Gatchalian, M.D. also attests that 
Vanessaâs vaginal opening admitted only one (1) finger with slight 
difficulty.

In the review of rape cases, this Court is almost invariably 
guided by three (3) principles, to wit:  (1) an accusation for rape can 
be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for 
the person accused, though innocent, to disprove;  (2) in view of the 
intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually
 involved, the testimony of the complainant is scrutinized with extreme 
caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution stands or falls on its
 own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of 
the defense.
[27]
 In other 
words, the credibility of the private complainant is determinative of 
the outcome of these cases for the crime of rape.  It is settled that in
 rape cases, the lone testimony of the victim, if credible, is enough to
 sustain a conviction.
[28]


Private complainant, Vanessa Cruz, testified in essence that she 
was raped by her father, herein appellant Simeon Cruz, once in the third
 week of August, which was a Wednesday evening, and twice in the second 
and third weeks of November, all in 1994.  The trial court found the 
testimony of the private complainant to be direct and spontaneous.  The 
said court also noted that Vanessa was only twelve (12) years old and a 
Grade V student in one of the remote towns of Nueva Ecija when she was 
raped.  She broke down in tears on several occasions during the trial of
 the instant cases,
[29]
 thus 
giving the trial court the unmistakable impression that she would not 
impute so grave an accusation against her own father if the same were 
not true.

We agree.  Considering the age of the private complainant, it 
would be highly improbable for a girl of her age to fabricate a charge 
so humiliating to herself and to her family had she not been truly 
subjected to the painful experience of sexual abuse.
[30]

 Indeed, no woman, much less a girl of such tender age, would willingly 
submit herself to the rigors, the humiliation and the stigma attendant 
upon the prosecution of rape, if she were not motivated by an earnest 
desire to put the culprit behind bars.
[31]


Besides, after a thorough review, this Court failed to discern 
any material contradiction in the testimony of Vanessa Cruz that may 
detract from her credibility.  Vanessa testified in a direct and 
spontaneous manner.  She did not waver in asserting that the appellant 
sexually abused her (3) three times even under the rigorous and 
extensive cross-examination of the defense counsel.  Hence, there is no 
cogent reason to depart from the time-honored legal principle that when 
the issue is one of the credibility of witnesses, appellate courts will 
not disturb the findings of the trial court.
[32]
 The reason for the principle is cited in the case of People vs. De Guzman,
[33]

 wherein this Court ruled that the trial judge is in the best position 
to detect that sometimes thin line between fact and prevarication that 
will determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.  That line may not
 be discernible from a mere reading of the impersonal record by the 
reviewing court.  The record will not reveal those tell-tale signs that 
will affirm the truth or expose the contrivance, like the angry flush of
 an insisted assertion or the sudden pallor of a discovered lie or the 
tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer or the forthright tone of a ready
 reply.  The record will not show if the eyes have darted in evasion or 
looked down in confession or gazed steadily with a serenity that has 
nothing to distort or conceal.  The record will not show if tears were 
shed in anger, or in shame, or in remembered pain, or in feigned 
innocence.  Only the judge trying the case can see all these and on the 
basis of his observations arrived at an informed and reasoned verdict.

Consequently, the bestiality of the appellant was portrayed 
vividly by private complainant Vanessa S. Cruz, in her own detailed 
account, thus:

[36]






The appellant failed to impute any improper motive on the part of the
 private complainant.  However, he lays the blame on his mother-in-law, 
Felicidad Santiago, who allegedly had an axe to grind against him over 
money.  He seeks to impress upon this Court that the instant criminal 
cases were offshoots of his mother-in-lawâs malicious contrivance which 
was aimed at exacting revenge against him and to pave the way for her 
daughterâs unhampered homecoming to the Philippines who allegedly 
maintained an adulterous relationship in Hong Kong where she works.

It is elementary that where there is no showing that the private 
complainant was impelled by any improper motive in making the 
accusations against the accused, her complaints are entitled to full 
faith and credence.
[37]
 The 
claims of the appellant against his mother-in-law are at best 
self-serving and too speculative to deserve any serious consideration by
 the Court.  That a grandmother would allegedly be so callous so as to 
expose her 12-year old granddaughter, Vanessa, to the humiliation and 
stigma of a rape trial just to satisfy a purely personal interest, 
defies logic and human experience.  We rule that no possible amount of 
influence from a grandmother can drive a daughter to willingly send her 
father to the gallows by imputing charges of rape if the same were not 
true.

Besides, even on the assumption that Marlyn S. Cruz had a 
paramour in Hong Kong where she works, the same was subsequently 
condoned by her husband, herein appellant, and had become a consensual 
matter between them, thus:



Court:
  


Q:   When for the first time that you knew that your wife had a live-in partner?
  


A:    When she went home, Your Honor, on November 30, 1995.
  


Q:   So, you want to impress the court that through overseas call 
your wife went home and you talked together about her live-in partner?
  


A:    Yes, Your Honor.
  


Q:   Now, when you had talk in November 1995 about her live-in partner, what was your final decision both of you?
  


A:    She informed me that she did that because of our children and if she can already save money she will return home.
  


Q:   So, meaning to say, you agreed with that condition of your wife?
  


A:    At first, Your Honor, I did not agree.
  


Q:   But ultimately, you agreed thatâs why she left again for abroad? 


A:    Yes, Your Honor.
[38]






Even when consumed with revenge, it takes a certain amount of 
psychological depravity for a young woman to concoct a story which could
 take the life of her own father and drag herself and the rest of the 
family to a lifetime of shame.
[39]

 As aptly pointed out by the Solicitor General, the appellant failed to 
demonstrate that his daughter, Vanessa, suffers from such kind of 
psychological depravity.  On the contrary, Vanessa was found by the 
trial court as a meek and modest girl.
[40]

 She was also gifted with brilliance, being an honor student, and having
 graduated from the elementary as one of the top five students in her 
class.
[41]


The appellant also contended that Vanessa appeared unaffected and
 went about her daily routine even after the alleged sexual abuses.  The
 contention is devoid of merit.  It should be emphasized that such 
alleged unseemly attitude of his daughter does not in any way negate 
that rape had been committed against her.  We have already ruled that 
people react differently to a given type of situation, and there is no 
standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a
 strange, startling or frightful experience.
[42]

 Additionally, Vanessaâs failure to promptly report the incidents of 
rape may be attributed to her young age and the appellantâs moral 
ascendancy.  It may be noted that the appellant threatened Vanessa with 
death after he perpetrated the dastardly acts against his said daughter.
  It is not uncommon for young girls to conceal for sometime the 
assaults on their virtue because of the rapistâs threats on their lives.
[43]


In a desperate attempt to extricate himself from the instant 
charges, appellant Simeon Cruz underscores the particular finding of the
 attending physician which states that Vanessaâs vagina admitted one (1)
 finger, which was two (2) centimeters in diameter, with slight 
difficulty.  The examining physician, Dra. Lucila Gatchalian, M.D. 
however, explained on cross-examination that Vanessa was afraid and 
crying while her hands were perspiring when she came to the hospital on 
April 30, 1996 for examination.  If a woman is afraid, according to Dra.
 Gatchalian, M.D., vaginismus or the unconscious constriction of the 
introitus or vaginal opening may happen.  In any case, the slight 
difficulty which occasioned the insertion of a finger, two (2) 
centimeters in diameter, into the private complainantâs vagina does not 
militate against the fact that she was raped.  The said fact is 
corroborated by the finding in the same medical certificate which shows 
that Vanessa sustained three (3) hymenal lacerations.

In view of the foregoing, the guilt of the appellant, Simeon B. 
Cruz, for three (3) counts of the crime of rape has been established 
beyond reasonable doubt.  However, the trial court erred in imposing the
 supreme penalty of death on the appellant.  Section 11 of Republic Act 
No. 7659 amending Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code provides:



x     x                                 x
  


The death penalty shall be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
  


1.  When the 
victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent
,
 ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity
 within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent 
of the victim.  xxx
  




It appears that the criminal complaints in Criminal Cases Nos. 
6970-AF, 6971-AF and 6972-AF against appellant Simeon B. Cruz merely 
allege that the private complainant, Vanessa S. Cruz, is the daughter of
 the appellant.  However, the same criminal complaints failed to allege 
that the private complainant was a minor or 
under eighteen (18) years of age
 at the time when each of the crimes of rape was committed against her.  In the cases of  People vs. Garcia,
[44]
 People vs. Ramos
[45]
 and People vs. Medina,
[46]

 this Court declared that the attendant circumstances enumerated in 
Section 11 of R.A. No. 7659 partake of the nature of qualifying 
circumstances since the same are punishable by the single indivisible 
penalty of death and not reclusion perpetua to death.  It has been the 
rule that qualifying circumstances must be properly pleaded in the 
indictment.  If the same are not pleaded but proved, they shall be 
considered only as aggravating circumstances.  Despite the absence of 
allegation in each of the criminal complaints in these cases that the 
private complainant was a minor or under eighteen (18) years of age at 
the time of the commission of each of the crimes of rape, the trial 
court erroneously imposed on the appellant the indivisible penalty of 
death in violation of his right under Article III, Section 14 of the 
1987 Constitution to be informed of the nature and cause of the 
accusations against him.  Consequently, the appellant can be held liable
 for three (3) counts of simple rape only and for which the impossible 
penalty is 
reclusion perpetua
.

In line with prevailing jurisprudence,
[47]
 the civil indemnity 
ex delicto

 due the victim shall be in the amount of P50,000.00 in addition to 
moral damages of P50,000.00  for each count of simple rape and without 
need of pleading or proof of the basis thereof.

WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Court hereby
 AFFIRMS the appealed decision convicting the appellant, Simeon B. Cruz,
 a.k.a. Barok, of three (3) counts of rape with the MODIFICATION that 
the appellant shall suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to 
indemnify the victim, herein private complainant Vanessa S. Cruz, in the
 amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity in addition to P50,000.00 as 
moral damages for each count of the offense proved.
