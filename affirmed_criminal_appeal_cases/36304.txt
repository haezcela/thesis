Filed on March 14, 1992 by
Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Normelito J. Ballocanag,  the Information indicting the three accused,
now appellants, alleges:


âThat  on or
about the 23rd day of November, 1990 at around 8:00 to 8:30 oâclock in the
evening, in barangay G. Antonio, municipality of Gloria, province of Oriental
Mindoro, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, Rommel Lacatan, Ruby Villamarin and Dominador Salazar
conspiring, confederating and acting in common accord, while armed with bladed

consent of the owner thereof, took and carried away cash money in the amount
of  ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND (
P

Pesos, assorted jewelries valued at FIFTY THOUSAND (
P

there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously and with evident premeditation and
taking advantage of their superior number and strength and with intent to kill,
treacherously attack, assault, box and stab said Alfredo Salazar on the
different parts of his body which caused his instantaneous death.


That in the commission of the dastardly crime, the
qualifying circumstances of evident premeditation, treachery and abuse of superior
strength and the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity and cruelty  were present.


CONTRARY TO LAW:â
  (Rollo, p. 12)


With all the accused entering
negative pleas upon arraignment on April 29, 1992, their trial ensued, with the
prosecution presenting Eduardo Ruallo, eyewitness to the crime, Elmer Salazar
and Edna Salazar, children, Anicia Salazar, widow, of the victim, Pat. Delfin
Yumang of the PNP in Gloria, Oriental Mindoro, and Dr. Edgardo N.
Hernandez,  medico-legal officer,  to prove the accusation.


For the defense, Rodolfo Umbao and
Ruel Suppleo, who were allegedly with prosecution witness Eduardo Ruallo
shortly before the incident,  and the
appellants themselves,  took the witness
stand.


Testified on by the above-named
witnesses, the version of the prosecution runs, thus:


On the evening of November 23,
1990, appellants took and carried away cash, jewelries and foodstuffs with a
total value of One Hundred Seventy Thousand 
(
P
170,000.00)
 Pesos,
from the house and store of Alfredo Salazar, and on the occasion of the
robbery, they killed the said storeowner.  The gory happening was witnessed by Eduardo Ruallo, a farmer residing in
Papandungin, Gloria, Oriental Mindoro, and a long time customer of the victim, who
had been borrowing money from him, since 1986.  The said eyewitness testified that on the fateful night of November 23,
1990, he went to Bgy. Tinalunan to borrow from Alfredo Salazar some amount with
which to buy fertilizer and chemicals.  He reached the Salazar residence at around 8:0`0 to 8:30 oâclock.  Hearing a commotion inside the house of
Alfredo Salazar, he (Eduardo) peeped through a window with transparent
jalousies, and he saw the herein appellants, Ruby Villamarin holding the right
arm and Dominador Salazar holding the left hand, of the victim, even as Rommel
Lacatan, who was then in front of the victim, was stabbing the latter several
times with a âgulukanâ.  He heard the
victim utter: â
Bakit ninyo ako ginaganito, kayo naman ay pinauutang ko
?â  At which juncture, Rommel Lacatan slit or
cut the victimâs mouth, after which the appellants dragged their victim from
the sala towards a toilet adjoining the bathroom.  Later on, the three entered the door leading to the store of the
victim and got some goods therefrom.  He
(witness) saw cigarettes scattered at  the store.  After the appellants
had gone out of the store, he 
(witness)
 went home right away.  The next day, upon the advice of his wife,
he left for Santo Tomas, La Union 
(her hometown)
 because of fear that
the appellants could have noticed his presence at the crime scene.  On January, l991, he addressed an anonymous
letter to Ka Alpe, the victimâs wife, to inquire about the investigation of the
death of her husband.  On December 15,
1991, he again wrote 
Ka
 Alpe to meet him at Ram 3,  Ram St. in Sampaloc, Manila.  Thereat, they met and he confided to her
what he saw, and right there and then, he volunteered to testify in the case;
this eyewitness recounted.  
(TSN,
September 22, 1992,  pp. 4-21)


Corroborating the testimony of
Eduardo Ruallo, Elmer Salazar and Edna Salazar, children of the victim,
declared that at past 9:00 oâclock on the evening of November 23, 1990, they
called on their fatherâs house but it was dark.  As there was no response, they entered through the back door of
their parentsâ abode.  Once inside the
house, they switched on the lights and saw clean empty bottles scattered all
over.  Things in the house and store
were in disarray, the glass of the 
aparador
 was shattered.  The container of their parentsâ money and
jewelries was destroyed and the money and jewelries therein contained were
missing.  When they opened the
bathroom,  they saw their father,
Alfredo Salazar, already dead, crouched on his arms and legs on the floor, face
downward, bathed with his own blood.  Terribly shocked, they called for help and police assistance. 
(Rollo,  p. 121)


Patrolman Delfin Yumang of the
Gloria PNP who responded, declared that at past 9:00 oâclock on the unfortunate
night of November 23, 1990, he took pictures of the deceased lying on the
bathroom, face down.  
(Exhibits  âCâ & âCâ-1)
  He also took pictures of the destroyed 
aparador

with contents scattered on the floor 
(Exhibit âCâ-2),
 of Pat.
Mantaring pointing to the receptacle inside the store 
(Exhibit âCâ-3)

and the drawer 
(Exhibit âCâ-4) 
and contents of the destroyed 
aparador


(Exhibit âCâ-5).
  This witness
likewise disclosed that he noticed bloodstains on the handle of the main door
of the house and store, and inside the store, a drop of blood on a bottle but
did not anymore take pictures thereof.  Witness also recalled that the store referred to was inside the house of
the victim so that for one  to buy from
the store,  the buyer must enter the
house.  
(Rollo,  p. 121)


Anicia Salazar, (
nicknamed Ka
Alpe, and wife of the victim)
 testified that on November 23, 1990, she was
in Lemery, Batangas, for the birthday of a grandson by her daughter, Fe
Manalo.  When she arrived in their house
in Tinalunan the following day, she lost consciousness upon seeing her dead
husband, Alfredo Salazar, in a coffin.  For funeral expenses, the bereaved family spent more than 
P
100,000.00,
and for the fare of their four children from Italy to the Philippines and back,
they spent another 
P
100,000.00.  The stolen money in dollars, liras and pesos amounted to around 
P
100,000.00,
the jewelries taken by the robbers were worth 
P
50,000.00 while the value
of the goods stolen from the store was 
P
20,000.00, and for attorneyâs
fees they paid 
P
30,000.00, witness told the court.  According to her, she received two anonymous
letters for her to meet the writer at Ram 3 Ram St., Sampaloc, Manila.  When she went to the designated place, the
author of said letters turned out to be Eduardo Ruallo, an old customer of
their store,  who volunteered to testify
regarding the slaying of her husband and robbery complained of, the commission
of which he witnessed.


Dr. Edgardo N. Hernandez,
Municipal Health Officer of Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro, conducted an autopsy
of the cadaver of the late Alfredo Salazar.  He reported that the deceased suffered nine 
(9)
 stab wounds and
five 
(5)
 incise wounds.  On the
witness stand, he opined that two weapons were used in the killing as the size
of two
 (2)
 wounds was different from the size of the eight
 (8)

other wounds.  
(TSN, July 15, 1992,
pp.15-16)


For their defense, appellants
placed reliance on denial and alibi.


Dominador Salazar theorized that
on November 23, 1990, he plowed the fields of his brother-in-law, Marcelo
Jadraque, from 9:00 oâclock in the morning to 5:00 oâclock in the
afternoon.  After taking merienda in the
house of Marcelo, he drank four 
(4)
 bottles of 
tuba
 with his
drinking partners at his residence, after which he went to sleep at 9:00
p.m.  
(TSN, July 12, 1994)


Ruby Villamarin and Rommel Lacatan
testified that on November 23, 1990, they were constructing his (Rubyâs) house,
with the help of five others about five hundred (500) meters from the house of
the deceased.  They drank 
tuba 
from
5:00 oâclock in the afternoon to 10:00 oâclock in the evening, at which time he

(Rommel),
 went home with his wife and  children to their house, situated a kilometer from the  house of the deceased.  
(TSN, May 16, 1994 & Feb. 22, 1994)


Also presented for the defense
were Rodolfo Umbao and Ruel  Suppleo,
who maintained that witness Eduardo Ruallo could not have seen the appellants
inside the house of the deceased Alfredo Salazar on November 23, 1990 because
from 5:00 to 8:00 p.m. on that day, they had a drinking spree with Eduardo
Ruallo at the place of Delia Villaverde in Papandungin, Gloria, Oriental
Mindoro.


After trial, the lower court
adjudged the Peopleâs version more credible and handed down the judgment of
conviction appealed from.


To buttress their supplication for
their acquittal, appellants theorize that the trial court:  
(1)
 in convicting them of the crime
of robbery with homicide, reasoning out that the prosecution failed to
establish the elements of the crime; 
(2)
 in giving full faith and credit
to the uncorroborated testimony of Eduardo Ruallo; and 
(3)
 in finding
them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged.


The pivotal issue at bar being
factual and evidentiary, the credibility of the witnesses assumes extreme
importance.


Well-settled to the point of being
elementary is the doctrine that on the issue of credibility of witnesses,
appellate courts will not disturb the findings arrived at by the trial court,
which was certainly in a better position to rate the credibility of the
witnesses after hearing them and observing their deportment and manner of
testifying during the trial.  This rule
stands absent any showing that certain facts and circumstances of weight and
value have been overlooked, misinterpreted or misapplied by the trial court
which, if considered, would affect the result or outcome of the case.


After a thorough review of the
evidence on hand, we discern no ground or basis for disregarding the
aforestated findings and conclusion by the lower court.  
(People vs. De Paz, 224 SCRA 474 [l993])


Appellants berate the
trustworthiness of eyewitness Eduardo Ruallo, branding his testimony
inconsistent as:  
(1)
 he
testified that after the victim was stabbed, the latter was dragged to the
toilet but the lifeless body of the victim was found inside the bathroom,
adjacent to the toilet; 
(2)
 no bloodstains were noticed at the sala where
the victim was allegedly stabbed; and 
(3)
 while Eduardo Ruallo testified
that the victim was stabbed several times with a âgulukanâ, the medico-legal
officer testified that there were two weapons used in the killing.


The exact part of the house to
which the deceased was dragged after he was stabbed, is too minor, trivial and
inconsequential a matter to  adversely
affect the credibility of eyewitness Eduardo Ruallo, who categorically declared
that the victim was being held by the two felons even as he was being stabbed
by Rommel Lacatan.


Anent the observation of the
defense that no bloodstains were seen at the sala of the Salazar residence
where the victim was supposedly stabbed, tenable is the contention of the
Solicitor General that when a person is stabbed, it does not necessarily follow
that there are bloodstains on the spot of the stabbing as the blood oozing from
the wounds could have been absorbed by the clothing of the victim before
dripping on the floor, or the bloodstains could have been wiped clean to erase
the traces of the crime.


The opinion of the medico-legal
officer that at least two weapons were used does not necessarily run counter to
what eyewitness Eduardo Ruallo recounted that he saw Rommel Lacatan stab the
victim several times with a âgulukanâ.  It is understandable that said eyewitness could have failed to observe
the minutest details of the entire happening inside the house of the
victim.  Other injuries could have been
inflicted with the use of another weapon before or after the infliction of the
wounds seen by witnessed Eduardo Ruallo.


Appellants also berate the
credibility of subject eyewitness for his failure to immediately report to the
police or to 
Ka
 Alpe 
(the victimâs wife)  
what he saw
.
  But delay in reporting the crime could not affect the credibility of
said eyewitness because as well explained, he left Gloria, Oriental Mindoro the
day after the incident because he was afraid that the appellants could have
noticed his presence at the place of the killing and might turn their ire on
him.  Time and again, this Court has
ruled that fear of reprisal is a valid excuse for the temporary silence of a
prosecution witness.  
(People vs.
Dulay, 217 SCRA 103 [1993])


Pat. Humanog of the local Police
Force took pictures not only of the victim lying face down on the floor of the
bathroom but also of the destroyed aparador with its contents scattered on the
floor, the receptacles found open and  drawer of the said aparador.  Ka
Alpe, widow of the victim and Elmer, her son, categorically declared that a lot
of money, jewelries and various goods were taken from their house and store by
the herein appellants.  On the occasion
of the robbery, Alfredo Salazar was mercilessly killed.  It is therefore abundantly clear, that the
crime of robbery with homicide, as charged and proven, was perpetrated by
appellants.  That only one eyewitness
testified on what happened is of no moment.  Even the testimony of a single witness who is credible and positive, is
enough to convict.  He can prove the
guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.  (People vs. Dela Paz, 
Supra
.)  Speaking through Mr. Justice Reynato S. Puno in People  vs. Antolin Hayahay, G.R. 120550, Sept. 26,
1997, this Court succinctly ratiocinated:


âMoreover, the fact that Ramil was the only eyewitness
to the crime and his testimony was not corroborated by any other witness cannot
detract from his credibility.  Our
jurisprudence is consistent that credibility does not go with numbers.  The testimony of a single witness, if
straightforward  and categorical is
sufficient to convict."


In this case the testimony of
eyewitness Eduardo Ruallo, which appears straightforward, deserves full  faith and credit.  Although the said witness frequently obtained credit from the
store of the deceased, there is nothing on record to show that he was
ill-motivated to testify against the appellants.  In fact, witness Eduardo Ruallo and appellants are residents of
the same community.  Verily, in the
absence proof of improper motive on the part of eyewitness Eduardo Rualo  to implicate appellants in the commission of
the malefaction sued upon, there is no cause or ground for not giving due
weight and probative value to the testimony of subject eyewitness.  (
People vs. Villagracia
, 219 SCRA
212, 1993)


The defense of alibi theorized and
relied upon by appellants is unavailing under the premises.  Well-settled is the rule that alibi, which
is easy to concoct, cannot prevail over the positive identification by
prosecution witnesses, such as eyewitness Eduardo Ruallo who repeatedly
identified appellants as the robbers who ransacked the house and store of the
lamented Alfredo Salazar, and killed their victim on the occasion of such
robbery.  Worse for appellants,  they utterly failed to prove convincingly
that it was physically impossible for them to have been at the scene of the
crime at the approximate time of its commission.  (
People  vs. Espinosa
;
243 SCRA 17, 1995.)  According to
appellants Rommel Lacatan and Ruby Villamarin, they were in the house of the
latter when the incident in question transpired.  In the case of appellant Dominador Salazar, he testified that he
was in his own house with his family, at the time.  But the three appellants are all residents of Tinalunan, Gloria,
Oriental Mindoro, the same barangay where the deceased resided.  In fact, records show that the dwelling
place of appellant Rommel Lacatan was only one hundred (
100)
 meters from
the house of the deceased, that of appellant Ruby Villamarin was just around
five hundred (
500
) meters away, while the place of Dominador Salazar was
approximately one (
1
) kilometer from the scene of the crime.  Evidently, it was not physically impossible
for appellants to have been at the scene of the crime when it was perpetrated
on November 23, 1990.


For the defense of alibi to
prosper, the requirements of time and place must be strictly met.  It is not enough to prove that appellants
were somewhere else when the crime was happened.  They must also demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that
it was physically impossible for them to have been at the scene of the crime at
the approximate time of its commission.  (
People vs. Dela Cruz
, 229 SCRA 765, [1994]; 
People vs. Barte
,
230 SCRA 408, [1994].  Here, it bears
stressing that appellants miserably failed to establish all the elements of
their defense of alibi.


All things studiedly viewed in
proper perspective, our mind can rest easy on a finding of appellants
guilt.  Judgment of affirmance is thus
indicated.


WHEREFORE
, the appealed judgment of conviction is hereby 
AFFIRMED

in its entirety.  Costs against
accused-appellants.
