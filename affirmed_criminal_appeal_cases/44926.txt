CHICO-NAZARIO, J.:


For review is the Decision,
[1]

dated 30 June 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR H.C. No.
00395, which affirmed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of
Nueva Vizcaya, Branch 37, in Criminal Case No. 1826, finding appellant
guilty of violation of Section 5, Republic Act No. 9165, otherwise
known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.
[2]


The Information dated 16 February 2004, charged appellant and her co-accused Imeldo Caoile
[3]
 as follows:


That on January 12, 2004, around 7:00 oâclock in the
evening in Barangay Calitlitan, Municipality of Aritao, Province of
Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable
Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually
helping one another, caught in flagrante elicto (sic), did then and
there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, deliver and give away
to a law enforcement agent who posed as a buyer of .25 gram
methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu), a dangerous drug, contained in
four small size heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets to the damage
and prejudice of the Republic of the Philippines.
[4]


When arraigned on 5 March 2004, both appellant and Caoile pleaded not guilty to the charge.
[5]

The prosecutionâs version is based mainly on the testimony of PO1 Henry
Valenzuela (PO1 Valenzuela), a member of the Provincial Anti-Illegal
Drug Special Operation Task Force assigned at the police station in
Alfonso CastaÃ±eda, Nueva Vizcaya.  According to him, in the afternoon
of 24 January 2004,
[6]

he was at the Aritao police station together with Police Senior
Inspector Prudencio Dela Cruz (PSI Dela Cruz), PO3 Manolo LapeÃ±a (PO3
LapeÃ±a), SPO2 Rogelio Orero (SPO2 Orero), and PO1 Rodelia Vergara (PO1
Vergara) discussing the conduct of the âbuy-bustâ operation within the
town of Aritao.  During the meeting, PSI Dela Cruz designated him as
the poseur buyer and gave him a 
P
500.00 bill for use as buy-bust money.


From the Aritao police station, they proceeded to 
Barangay

Bone for the execution of the first buy-bust operation which was
directed against a certain Reynaldo Mazo (Mazo).  Apparently, the
operation was a success as they were able to apprehend Mazo and to
bring him to the police station.  While being interviewed by PSI Dela
Cruz, Mazo allegedly revealed the identities of the other people
involved in the drug trade in the area.  And so, their team planned
another buy-bust operation.  This time, the subject of their operation
was herein appellant who lived in 
Barangay

Calitlitan of the same town.  Their team arrived at appellantâs house
at around seven oâclock in the evening.  Upon their arrival, Mazo, who
they brought along for the purpose of the buy-bust operation,
introduced PO1 Valenzuela to appellant.  Mazo told appellant that PO1
Valenzuela needed to buy 
shabu
. 
Appellant then sought the permission of Caoile for the transaction. 
The latter allegedly agreed and so appellant went inside a room.  When
she returned, she pulled heat-sealed sachets from her pocket and handed
them to Mazo who, in turn, gave appellant the marked 
P
500.00 bill.
[7]
  Mazo then turned over to PO1 Valenzuela the items he got from appellant.  Convinced that what appellant had given them was 
shabu
,
PO1 Valenzuela gave the pre-arranged signal to his companions who were
then within the vicinity of appellantâs house.  PO1 Vergara and Police
Chief Zaidee Daculog (Police Chief Daculog), entered the house and
identified themselves as police officers.  PO1 Vergara proceeded to
frisk appellant and subjected her to a body search, but the procedure
did not produce any contraband.  For his part, PO1 Valenzuela went up
to Caoile to prevent the latter from giving any aid to appellant.  PO3
LapeÃ±a also helped Police Chief Daculog in searching for more illegal
drugs in the living room of appellantâs house.  Again, the search
yielded nothing.

Appellant was then taken to the Aritao police station.  It was there
that PO1 Vergara put the markings on the four plastic sachets allegedly
sold by appellant.  Another police officer, PO1 Magdalena Alicum (PO1
Alicum), took over the preparation of the request for laboratory
examination and transfer of the confiscated items to the provincial
office of the PNP crime laboratory.  When the prosecutor presented four
marked plastic sachets, PO1 Valenzuela identified them to be the ones
they recovered from appellant in the course of the buy-bust operation.

For its part, the defense presented Caoile, appellantâs boyfriend, as
its first witness.  He testified that on 12 January 2004, he went to
appellantâs house and found her resting on the bed.  After taking a
brief rest, the two of them went outside to buy meat at a nearby
store.  Upon their return, he immediately went to the kitchen to
prepare their food, while appellant sat on the hammock.  Thereafter,
Mazo arrived together with another man whom he identified as PO1
Valenzuela. According to him, Mazo was an acquaintance, as the latterâs
family was a customer of the store he used to work for.  He claimed
that it was appellant who talked to Mazo and the unidentified man while
he remained in the kitchen and was unaware of what the conversation was
all about.  All of a sudden, more men barged inside appellantâs house
and started searching the living room and the bedroom.  PO1 Valenzuela
then told him that they had recovered 
shabu
. 
Another police officer started frisking his front pocket but he slapped
the latterâs hand as he thought evidence might be planted against him. 
His back pocket was likewise searched and again, he slapped the police
officerâs hand.  He claimed that he opted to tear up his back pocket
and that he even offered to remove all his clothing to prove that he
did not have any illegal drugs in his possession.

The police then invited appellant to the municipal police headquarters
and he insisted on coming along to make sure that ânothing will happenâ
to her.  Instead of heading straight to the headquarters, they first
passed by the house of SPO2 Orero at Bone South where they were told to
sit at the terrace while the police officers took a rest. From there,
they proceeded to the Aritao police station.

Caoile added that he and appellant were not the only ones who were
taken to the police headquarters that night for according to him, two
individuals, Sarmiento and Valdez, were with them as well as Mazo
himself.
[8]

Appellant also testified in her defense and her testimony corroborated
that of Caoile.  She claimed that she knew Mazo because he was one of
the customers at the videoke bar where she used to work.  Contrary to
the statement of PO1 Valenzuela that Mazo negotiated the sale of 
shabu

with her on the evening of her arrest, appellant insisted that PO1
Valenzuela merely asked her if she was aware of Mazoâs drug-related
activities.  After she denied any knowledge of said activities, about
five men wearing short pants barged into her house and started
conducting a search until one of them declared that he had found 
shabu
.


After the trial, the court 
a quo

rendered its decision finding appellant guilty as charged, while Caoile
was acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt.  The dispositive
portion of the decision states:

WHEREFORE, the court finds the accused Marilyn Miranda
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Republic Act
No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, and hereby
imposes upon her the penalty of life imprisonment plus a fine of Five
hundred thousand pesos (
P
500,000.00), and to pay the costs. 
Considering the insufficiency of evidence, the court hereby acquits
Imeldo Caoili on reasonable doubt.  He is hereby ordered released
unless he is being held for some other valid cause or causes.

The methamphetamine hydrochloride subject of this case is hereby
declared forfeited in favor of the government, to be destroyed in
accordance with the aforesaid law.  The clerk of court is directed to
coordinate with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency for this purpose.
[9]



In convicting appellant, the trial court declared that â


The court believes, and so holds, that the specimen
positively tested for methamphetamine hydrochloride by forensic chemist
Alfredo Quintero was the same taken from the accused.  Chemistry Report
No. D-003-2004 not only indicated the names of the suspects, Imeldo
Caoili and Marilyn Miranda but also the markings âRCVâ written on the
specimen examined.  These initials were written by PO1 Rodelia C.
Vergara in the presence of PO1 Valenzuela.  The latter also testified
that the sachets were delivered to the crime laboratory and even
identified the receipts evidencing such delivery.  More importantly, he
identified the sachets in court and the accused had the opportunity to
cross-examine him on this point (Peo. v. Babac, 204 SCRA 968). 
Finally, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official
duties applies to this case, especially in the absence of any proof of
any ulterior motive for the public officers to testify against the
accused.  The court therefore entertains no doubt that the sachets
marked âRCVâ were the very ones given by the accused Miranda to Mazo
and Valenzuela during the buy-bust operation.
[10]


On 19 October 2004, appellant filed a Notice of Appeal,
[11]
 which was granted by the trial court in its Order,
[12]
 dated 22 October 2003, thereby elevating the case to the Court of Appeals.


On 30 June 2006, the Court of Appeals promulgated the herein assailed Decision affirming the appellantâs conviction, thus:


WHEREFORE
, the appealed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Nueva Vizcaya (Branch 37), dated October 9, 2004, is 
AFFIRMED
.  Costs against the appellant.
[13]

The Court of Appeals reiterated the oft-cited rule that factual
findings of the trial court especially on the credibility of witnesses
are accorded great weight and respect because of the trial courtâs
unequalled opportunity to observe the demeanor and conduct of the
witnesses.  In this case, PO1 Valenzuelaâs testimony with regard to the
buy-bust operation was found to be convincing, credible, and sufficient
to support a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  The Court of
Appeals also held that when a police officer, such as PO1 Valenzuela,
was not moved by ill motive to testify falsely against an accused,
courts are inclined to uphold the presumption of regularity in the
performance of his duty.

The Court of Appeals likewise brushed aside appellantâs argument that
the evidenceâs chain of custody was not established for it was not
shown that what were allegedly sold to the poseur-buyer and taken from
appellant were the same ones actually forwarded to the crime
laboratory.  The Court of Appeals held that â

We note that while the marking of the sachets in this case
was not done by the arresting officers in strict compliance with
Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (The Comprehensive Dangerous
Drugs Act of 2002), there is no doubt that the plastic sachets of shabu
with the markings âRCV,â referring to the initials of arresting officer
PO1 Rodelio C. Vergara (PO1 Vergara), contained the same specimens
recovered from the appellant.  PO1 Valenzuela affirmed that this (sic) 
markings were made by PO1 Vergara in his presence.  He also
specifically narrated the incident from the time appellant turned over
the plastic sachets to him until the time they were marked by PO1
Vergara in his presence and finally when the same was referred to the
forensic chemist for qualitative examination.  As correctly noted by
the trial court, PO1 Valenzuela witnessed the delivery of the sachets
of shabu to the Crime Laboratory and even identified the receipts
evidencing such delivery.  There is no question, therefore, that the
identity of the prohibited drug in this case was certainly safeguarded.
[14]

Because of the adverse ruling of the Court of Appeals, appellant now
seeks the review of her case by this Court.  On 29 November 2006, we
required the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs if
they so desired.
[15]

On 23 January 2007, appellant filed her Manifestation stating that she
was adopting her Appellantâs Brief dated 21 June 2005 filed before the
Court of Appeals as her supplemental brief.
[16]


Appellant makes a lone assignment of error:


THE COURT 
A QUO

GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED
DESPITE THE PROSECUTIONâS FAILURE TO PROVE HER GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE
DOUBT.
[17]

Appellant argues that the prosecution failed to establish the elements
of the crime she was charged with. She points out that other than the
testimony of the alleged poseur-buyer, the prosecution failed to
present any other evidence that the alleged buy-bust transaction took
place.  Moreover, she contends that the only subject of the police
operation on that day was Mazo, while the operation involving her arose
only out of what Mazo had supposedly told the police officers.  To
bolster her claim of innocence, she also draws our attention to the
fact that the warrantless search of her house conducted by the police
did not yield any incriminating evidence against her.  She also
contends that while the alleged buy-bust operation transpired at around
seven oâclock in the evening, the excerpt from the police blotter
showed that it was only at around nine oâclock of the same night when
the alleged marked money used by the police was recorded therein. 
Appellant also argues that the chain of custody of the four sachets of 
shabu

purportedly recovered from her was not established and that the
prosecution failed to prove that the plastic sachets forwarded to the
crime laboratory for examination were indeed the ones she âsoldâ to PO1
Valenzuela. Thus, appellant contends that the police failed to prove
that the contraband items were first weighed before they were turned
over to the crime laboratory.

In its Supplemental Brief, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG)
counters that the chain of custody over the confiscated drug was duly
established by the prosecution.  It argues that the issue of the
faithful handling of the 
shabu

was never raised during the trial of this case and that appellant is
belatedly raising such issue on appeal.  And even if said question
would be considered, the OSG opines that it should not affect the
outcome of the case, for the chain of custody was proven in that PO1
Valenzuela testified regarding the conduct of the buy-bust, his
transfer of the possession of the 
shabu

to PO1 Vergara, the latterâs marking of the plastic sachets, and PO1
Alicumâs preparation of the request for laboratory examination and the
turnover of the illegal drug to the crime laboratory.

The OSG also insists that the prosecution had discharged its burden of
proving appellantâs guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the elements of
the crime she was charged with were established during the trial.

At the outset, we address the argument raised by the OSG that it is now
too late for appellant to raise the issue of chain of custody on
appeal.  Such stance clearly overlooks one of the distinctions between
a criminal case and a civil case.  To reiterate, an appeal in a
criminal case opens the entire case for review.  The reviewing tribunal
can correct errors though unassigned in the appeal, or even reverse the
trial courtâs decision on grounds other than those the parties raised
as errors.
[18]
  Notwithstanding this, we still find no cogent reason warranting the acquittal of appellant in this case.

A buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment whereby ways and means are
employed for the purpose of trapping and capturing lawbreakers in the
execution of their plan.
[19]
 It has become a familiar and much-resorted to procedure to apprehend
lawless elements and to put a dent on the proliferation of criminal
activities.  In particular, its use has been proven effective in
putting an end to the illicit business of drug peddlers who are
susceptible to deal with anyone willing to purchase their goods even if
the prospective buyer is a total stranger.  Unless there is a clear and
convincing evidence that the members of the buy-bust team were inspired
by any improper motive or were not properly performing their duty,
their testimonies with respect to the operation deserve full faith and
credit.
[20]


In this case, PO1 Valenzuelaâs recollection of the buy-bust operation is as follows:
 
 
 
 
Q
 
You said that you planned another buy bust operation, when did you plan this buy bust operation against this Marilyn Miranda?
 
 
A:
Initially we planned this buy bust operation at the Aritao Police Station, Sir.

A:
 
At the vicinity of the house of Marilyn Miranda, Sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
After you gave the pre-arranged signal, what happened next?
 
 
A:
 
PO1 Vergara and the chief of police entered the house and identified themselves as police officers, Sir.
[22]
 
In our minds, PO1 Valenzuelaâs testimony was able to meet the requirement we laid down in 
People v. Ong
,
[23]

in that, he was able to present a complete picture detailing the
buy-bust operation â from the initial contact between the poseur-buyer
and the pusher, the offer to purchase, the promise or payment of the
consideration until the consummation of the sale by the delivery of the
illegal drug subject of the sale.
[24]
 
His testimony revealed how their team came to know about appellantâs
drug trade; the manner of negotiation for the purchase of 
shabu

among appellant, Mazo, and himself; the exchange of consideration
between Mazo and appellant; and Mazoâs handing over to him of the
subject of the sale.

From the foregoing, it is patently clear that the prosecution succeeded
in establishing, with moral certainty, all the elements of the illegal
sale of 
shabu
,
to wit: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller, object, and
consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment
therefor.
[25]
  The presence
of these elements is sufficient to support appellantâs finding of guilt
and is not negated by the policeâs failure to find any other contraband
in her house.

We are neither persuaded by appellantâs contention that the buy-bust
operation was directed only at Mazo.  While it is true that based on
the testimony of PO1 Valenzuela, the buy-bust team met at the Aritao
police station to coordinate their entrapment of Mazo, this fact should
not in any way affect the validity of the buy-bust operation conducted
against her.  To reiterate, her name and involvement in the illegal
sale of 
shabu

only became known to the police after Mazoâs arrest.  Thus, it was only
after Mazo revealed her identity to the police that she became the
target of another entrapment operation and in her case, Mazo himself
was used as an intermediary by the buy-bust team.

Moreover, appellant failed to present any plausible reason or ill
motive on the part of the arresting officers to falsely impute to her
such a serious and unfounded charge.
[26]
 
From her testimony, it can easily be discerned that she did not know
any one of the members of the buy-bust team who arrested her.  She even
referred to them as Mazoâs âcompanions.â  This fact supports the Court
of Appealsâ holding that â

Then too, the rule is settled that the testimony of a law
enforcer carries with it the presumption of regularity in the
performance of his official functions.  When a police officer has no
motive for testifying falsely against the accused, courts are inclined
to uphold the presumption of regularity in the performance of his
duty.  Here, no evidence whatsoever was presented which would suggest
any improper motive on the part of PO1 Valenzuela.  We must accord
great respect to and treat with finality the findings of the trial
court on the matter of his credibility.
[27]

We likewise find no merit in appellantâs contention that the buy-bust
operation was tainted with irregularity by the belated recording of the
buy-bust money in the records of the police.  It is settled that the
recording of marked money used in a buy-bust operation is not one of
the elements for the prosecution of sale of illegal drugs.  The
recording or non-recording thereof in an official record will not
necessarily lead to an acquittal as long as the sale of the prohibited
drug is adequately proven.
[28]


As to appellantâs insistence that the 
shabu

confiscated from her was not sufficiently established by the
prosecution, the records will bear out that PO1 Valenzuela positively
identified in court the four plastic sachets containing 
shabu

which they bought from her.  While he did not put any markings on the
items, he witnessed his fellow member of the buy-bust team, PO1
Vergara, put his initials âRCVâ on the sachets.  Obviously, the
identity of the 
corpus delicti
 has been duly preserved and established by the prosecution in this case contrary to appellantâs protestation.
[29]
 
Besides, the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved
unless there is a showing of bad faith, ill will, or proof that the
evidence has been tampered with.  The appellant in this case bears the
burden to make some showing that the evidence was tampered or meddled
with to overcome a presumption of regularity in the handling of
exhibits by public officers and a presumption that public officers
properly discharge their duties.
