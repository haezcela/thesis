ELVIRA LATEO Y ELEAZAR, FRANCISCO ELCA Y ARCAS, AND BARTOLOME BALDEMOR Y MADRIGAL, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




NACHURA, J.:


On appeal is the August 7, 2003 Decision
[1]
  of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 23240, which affirmed with modification the March 17, 1998
[2]

 decision  of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasay City, Branch 109, 
convicting Elvira Lateo (Lateo), Francisco Elca (Elca), and Bartolome 
Baldemor (Baldemor) of attempted 
estafa
.


On April 28, 1995, Lateo, Elca, and Baldemor (petitioners), along with 
Orlando Lalota (Lalota) and Nolasco de Guzman (De Guzman), were charged 
with 
estafa
 in an information, which reads: 




    That on or about April 27, 1995, in Pasay City, Metro Manila and 
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused ELVIRA LATEO y 
ELEAZAR, conspiring and confederating with FRANCISCO ELCA y ARCAS, 
BARTOLOME BALDEMOR y MADRIGAL, ORLANDO LALOTA and NOLASCO DE GUZMAN, and
 mutually helping one another, acting in common accord, by means of 
deceit, that is, by falsely representing themselves to be the true and 
[lawful] owner of a piece of land located in the province of Cavite, and
 possessing power, influence, qualification, property, credit, agency, 
business, or imaginary transactions and by means of other similar 
deceits, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
induce ELEONOR LUCERO to part with her money in the amount of TWO 
MILLION (P2,000,000.00) PESOS, Philippine Currency, as indeed she parted
 only with the amount of Two Hundred Thousand (P200,000.00) PESOS, 
Philippine Currency, which said accused actually received in marked 
Philippine Currency, to the damage and prejudice of said ELEONOR LUCERO 
in the aforestated amount of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00) 
PESOS Philippine Currency.  
  



    CONTRARY TO LAW. 
[3]
 





When arraigned on May 31, 1995, 
petitioners, with the assistance of their counsel, entered their 
respective pleas of not guilty. Accused Lalota and De Guzman remained at
 large. 


Trial on the merits then ensued.  The prosecutionâs version of the facts is summarized by the CA in this wise:




 Sometime in 1994, [petitioners] Lateo and Elca proposed that [Lucero] 
finance the titling of the 122 hectares of land located in Muntinlupa 
allegedly owned by [petitioner] Elca as the sole heir of Gregorio Elca. 
Title to the property had not been transferred to [petitioner] Elcaâs 
name because of a certain discrepancy between the Deed of Sale and TCT 
No. 77730.  [Petitioner] Elca offered to assign to [Lucero] 70 hectares 
of said land. She was then introduced to [petitioner] Baldemor, Orlando 
Lalota and Nolasco de Guzman. 



    [Lucero] released to 
[petitioners] about P4.7 million in staggered amounts.  [Petitioner] 
Elca told [Lucero] that certain portions of the property will first be 
put in the name of [petitioner] Lateo and would later be assigned to 
her.  [Lucero] was given a Deed of Sale dated March 27, 1987.  
[Petitioner] Elca likewise executed an irrevocable Special Power of 
Attorney in favor of [Lucero].  Later, she was presented certified true 
copies of three (3) titles, TCT Nos. 195550, 195551 and 195552 issued by
 the Register of Deeds of Makati City in the name of [petitioner] Lateo 
covering approximately twenty-seven (27) hectares of Plan A-7 of the 
Mutinlupa Estate, situated in Barrio Magdaong, Poblacion, Muntinlupa.  
However, [in] December 1994, when [Lucero] verified with the Registry of
 Deeds of Makati, she discovered that the aforesaid titles of the 
property were actually registered in the names of Marc Oliver R. 
Singson, Mary Jeanne S. Go and Feliza C. Torrigoza.
  



    [Lucero] confronted 
[petitioners] and demanded from them [the] return of the money.  She was
 told that they did not have any money to return.  They instead offered a
 five (5) hectare property identified as Lot 10140 of Plan Sgs 
04213-000441 located at Bacoor, Cavite allegedly owned by [petitioner] 
Elca.  [Petitioner] Elca, however, demanded an additional P2 million for
 the transfer of title. 
  



    When [Lucero] verified with the 
Land Management Bureau (LMB), she discovered that [petitioner] Elca only
 had a pending application for the sales patent over a four 
(4)[-hectare] area of the subject land.  These misrepresentations 
prompted her to file a complaint with the Task Force Kamagong, PACC, 
Manila.
  



  On April 26, 1995, the task force 
conducted an entrapment at Furosato Restaurant.  [Petitioners] were 
apprehended in possession of marked 100-peso bills amounting to 
P100,000.00, supposedly in exchange for the Deed of Assignment prepared 
by [Lucero] for their transaction. 
[4]







Petitionersâ version, on the other hand, is summed up as follows:




 Sometime in 1994, [Lucero], [petitioner] Lateo, Oscar Lalota met with 
[petitioner] Elca in Muntinlupa to discuss the proposal of [Lucero] to 
finance the titling of [petitioner] Elcaâs land. 



 On June 28, 1994, in a meeting called by [Lucero], she laid down the 
terms and conditions regarding her plans to finance the titling of 
[petitioner] Elcaâs land.  She proposed that 22 out of the 122 hectares 
of the land would be given to the old tenants of the property, the 30 
hectares would be titled in the name of [petitioner] Elca as his 
retained share and the other 70 hectares would be her profit as 
financier of the transaction.  [Lucero] would also pay P10.00 for every 
square meter of the 70 hectares or a total amount of P7 million.  All 
the expenses for the titling and management of the land would be 
deducted from P7 million.  The remaining balance would then be given to 
[petitioners]. 



 [Lucero] assigned Oscar Lalota to work for the titling of the land and 
to prepare all documents necessary thereto. [Petitioner] Baldemor would 
act as overseer of the transaction as [Luceroâs] attorney-in-fact.  
[Petitioner] Lateo would serve as secretary and assistant of [Lucero].  
[Petitioner] Elca would guard the property to keep off squatters.  He 
and his wife were instructed to sign all documents prepared by Oscar 
Lalota. 



    In December 1994, [Lucero] told 
[petitioner] Elca that upon verification from the Registry of Deeds of 
Makati City, she found out that all the documents submitted by Oscar 
Lalota pertaining to their transaction were falsified.  Oscar Lalota 
disappeared after getting the money.
  



 In order to recover her losses from the anomalous transaction, [Lucero]
 offered to purchase [petitioner] Elcaâs property in Cavite.  
[Petitioner] Elca agreed to sell 2 hectares of his property at a price 
of P100.00 per square meter.  [Petitioner] Elca informed [Lucero] that 
the land was not yet titled although the documents had already been 
completed.  [Lucero] agreed to pay in advance the amount of P200,000.00 
for the immediate titling of the land. 



  On December 21, 1994, however, 
[Lucero] gave no advance payment.  [Petitioner] Elca was made to return 
[in] January 1995.  On that date still [Lucero] made no payment.
  



  On [April] 25, 1995, [Lucero] 
promised to give the P200,000.00 advance payment at Furosato Restaurant 
[on] Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City.  Having failed to contact his lawyer, 
on [April] 26, 1995, [petitioner] Elca went alone to Furosato 
Restaurant.  Because of the absence of [petitioner] Lateo, [Lucero] 
postponed their meeting to [April] 27, 1995.
  



 When [petitioner] Elca arrived at Furosato Restaurant on [April] 27, 
1995, [Lucero] and her lawyer Atty. Velasquez, [petitioners] Lateo and 
Baldemor and Atty. Ambrosio were already there.  Atty. Velasquez, upon 
the order of [Lucero], produced a document entitled âContract to Sellâ 
outlining their agreement over the 2 hectares of land in Bacoor, Cavite.
  Atty. Ambrosio examined the contract to find out if it contains the 
terms and conditions agreed upon.  Attys. Velasquez and Ambrosio made 
their own handwritten corrections in the contract including the change 
of the title from âContract to Sellâ to âDeed of Assignment,â after 
which, both of them signed the document.  [Petitioner] Elca and [Lucero]
 signed the document as parties while [petitioners] Lateo and Baldemor 
signed as witnesses. 



  After the signing of the Deed of 
Assignment, [Lucero] brought out the P200,000.00 as the promised payment
 for the land.  While [petitioner] Baldemor was counting the money, 
Atty. Velasquez and [Lucero] went to the comfort room.  Thereafter, 
several agents of the PACC approached them.  They were arrested and 
brought to the NBI Headquarters. 
[5]







After trial, the RTC rendered a decision
[6]
  dated March 17, 1998, 
viz
.:




    It should be noted that the 
transaction over the Cavite property was a continuation of and is 
somehow related to their first transaction.  The same was offered to 
[Lucero] in lieu of the Muntinlupa property with Francisco Elca telling 
[Lucero] just to add another two million (P2,000,000.00) pesos plus 
expenses for titling and the property can be transferred to her.
  



 The second transaction which covers the Bacoor property was again an 
attempt to defraud [Lucero] when Francisco Elca again represented 
himself as the owner of the said property when in truth and in fact his 
right was merely derived from his application to purchase Friar Lands 
dated June 25, 1992 which at the time of the transaction was still being
 protested as shown by the Investigation Report of Rogelio N. Bruno, 
Special Investigator II, DENR, Land Management Bureau (Exhibit âLLLLâ) 
hence accused has no right and/or authority to deliver or transfer the 
ownership over said parcel of land to [Lucero]. 



 In the case of Celino vs. CA 163 SCRA 97, it was held that âEstafa 
under Art. 315 (2) (a) of the Revised Penal Code is committed by means 
of using fictitious name or falsely pretending to possess power, 
influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or 
imaginary transaction or by means of other similar deceits.  Further, in
 the case of Villaflor vs. CA 192 SCRA 680, the Supreme Court held: what
 is material is the fact that appellant was guilty of fraudulent 
misrepresentation when knowing that the car was then owned by the 
Northern Motors, Inc., still he told the private complainant that the 
car was actually owned by him for purposes of and at the time he 
obtained the loan from the latter.  Indubitably, the accused was in bad 
faith in obtaining the loan under such circumstance. 



    The attempt to defraud the 
complainant did not materialize due to the timely intervention of the 
Task Force Kamagong operatives.
Art. 6, par. 3 of the Revised Penal 
Code provides that âthere is an attempt when the offender convinces 
(sic) the commission of a felony directly by overt acts and does not 
perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by 
reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous 
desistance.â  The entrapment thus prevented the consummation of the 
transaction over the Cavite property.




 x x x [I]n the case of Koh Tieck Heng vs. People 192 SCRA 533, the 
Court held [that] âalthough one of the essential elements of Estafa is 
damage or prejudice to the offended party, in the absence of proof 
thereof, the offender would x x x be guilty of attempted 
estafa
.â Appellant commenced the commission of the crime of 
estafa

 but he failed to perform all the acts of execution which would produce 
the crime not by reason of [their] spontaneous desistance but because of
 his apprehension of the authorities before they could obtain the 
amount.  Since only the intent to cause damage and not the damage itself
 has been shown respondent court correctly convicted appellant of 
attempted 
estafa
.
  



 The culpability of x x x the accused is strengthened by the transfer of
 his rights over the same subject land in Cavite in favor of Leticia 
Ramirez (Exhibit âNNNNâ) thus clearly influencing his intention to 
defraud herein complainant as the same shows his lack of intent to 
transfer his rights and/or ownership to complainant. 



 The representations made by Francisco Elca that he owns the property in
 Bacoor, Cavite, his having offered the same again to the complainant in
 lieu of the aborted deal in the Muntinlupa property their constant 
follow-up of complainantâs decision over the matter convincing the 
complainant to accept the offer and their persona[l] presence at the 
place of entrapment and their receipt of the P100,000.00 marked money 
which they even counted one after the other, thus making all of them 
positive of the presence of fluorescent powder.  Those among others 
indicate strongly that all three accused Francisco Elca, Elvira Lateo 
and Bartolome Baldemor attempted to deceive and defraud complainant 
Eleanor Lucero. 
[7]
 





The RTC decreed that:




    IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, 
the Court finds all accused Francisco Elca, Elvira Lateo and Bartolome 
Baldemor guilty beyond reasonable doubt of attempted Estafa and is 
hereby sentenced to imprisonment of Ten (10) years and One (1) Day to 
Twelve (12) Years.
  



    SO ORDERED. 
[
8]







Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration
[9]
,  but the RTC denied it on December 28, 1998.
 
[10]



Petitioners appealed to the CA, assigning in their brief the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:




    I.	That with due respect to the 
Honorable Court, it is respectfully submitted that it erred in finding 
that THEY ARE GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF ATTEMPTED ESTAFA UNDER ARTICLE 315 
PAR. 2(a) OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE.
  



    II.	That the basis of the findings of the Honorable Court that they (three accused) are guilty of attempted 
estafa
 is not in accordance with the evidence on record.
  



    III.	That the Honorable Court 
erred in the imposition of the appropriate penalty based on its findings
 assuming without admitting that they (three accused) are guilty of 
attempted estafa. 
[11]







The CA was not at all persuaded by 
petitionersâ arguments and sustained petitionersâ conviction, although 
with modification as to the penalty imposed.  The decretal portion of 
the CA Decision reads:





WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the assailed decision is hereby 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION

 as to the penalty imposed.  [Petitioners] Elvira E. Lateo, Francisco A.
 Elca and Bartolome M. Baldemor are hereby sentenced to suffer an 
indeterminate penalty of 
six (6) months of arresto mayor
 as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of 
prision correccional
, as maximum. 
  



    Cost against [petitioners].
  



    SO ORDERED. 
[12]








Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration,
[13]
  but their motion also suffered the same fate, as the CA denied it on January 12, 2004. 
[14]



Before us, petitioners insist that 
their conviction lacked factual and legal basis.  They assail the RTC 
finding, which was sustained by the CA, that the transaction involving 
the Bacoor property was again an attempt to defraud Eleonor Lucero 
(Lucero).  Petitioners deny that they deceived Lucero. They claim that 
Lucero was aware that the Bacoor property is not yet titled in the name 
of Elca; and that they went to Furosato restaurant upon Luceroâs 
invitation and on Luceroâs representation that she would hand to them 
the P200,000.00 needed to facilitate the issuance of title in Elcaâs 
name. Petitioners, therefore, plead for an acquittal.  Finally, 
petitioners assail the penalty imposed by the CA for being erroneous.  


The Office of the Solicitor General 
(OSG), on the other hand, asserts that the CA correctly sustained 
petitionersâ conviction for attempted 
estafa
.  However, it recommends for further modification of the penalty to six (6) months of 
arresto mayor
.


Inarguably, the resolution of the 
issues raised by petitioners requires us to inquire into the sufficiency
 of the evidence presented, including the credibility of the witnesses, a
 course of action which this Court will not do, consistent with our 
repeated holding that this Court is not a trier of facts. Basic is the 
rule that factual findings of trial courts, including their assessment 
of the witnessesâ credibility, are entitled to great weight and respect 
by this Court, particularly when the CA affirms the findings. 
[15]



It is true that the rule admits of several exceptions,
[16]
  but none of the recognized exceptions is present in the case at bar.  


Article 315(2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code lists the ways by which 
estafa
 may be committed, which includes:



 Art. 315. 
Swindling
 (
estafa
). â x x x. 



  x x x x 			
  




  2.	By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts
 executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud:
  






        (a) By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess 
power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or 
imaginary transactions; or by means of other similar deceits.
    







The elements of the felony are as follows:



 That there must be a false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means.
  


    That such false pretense, fraudulent act or fraudulent means must
 be made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of 
the fraud.
  
 That the offended party must have relied on the false pretense, 
fraudulent act, or fraudulent means, that is, he was induced to part 
with his money or property because of the false pretense, fraudulent 
act, or fraudulent means.
  

    That as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage. 
[17]









We
 agree with the finding of the trial court that the transaction 
involving the Bacoor property was a continuation of the transaction 
involving parcels of land in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila. When Lucero 
discovered that Elcaâs certificates of title over the Muntinlupa 
property were fake, Elca offered, as substitute, the 5-hectare portion 
of his purported 14-hectare lot in Bacoor, Cavite, but asked for an 
additional  P2,000,000.00, in this wise:




  Dear Ms. Lucero:
  






        This is with reference to the advances we had obtained from you 
in the total amount of P4.7 million, more or less.  It was agreed that 
the said advances shall be due and demandable upon the release of titles
 over my parcels of land situated in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila of which 
we are presently working out with appropriate government agencies.  Your
 current demand fro[m] us to pay the aforesaid amount plus your 
unilaterally imposed interests is therefore premature and baseless.
    




        However, with regards to your alternative demand that you be 
given a total of 5 hectares (2 has. upon signing of an agreement 
assigning my rights and additional 3 has. upon complete release of the 
remaining 14 hectares) please be informed that I am now amenable, 
provided that an additional P2.0 million will be paid to me to take care
 of my other personal commitments.  These 5 hectares are situated in 
Malipay, Bacoor, Cavite with a portion of Lot 10140 of Plan 
Sgs-04213-000441-D.  I am expecting the title of said property early 
next year.  The current market [valuation] of real estate properties in 
that area is P450.00 per square meter and hence, the property will be 
more [than] sufficient to cover our obligates (sic).
    







            Please be guided accordingly.
        














				Very truly yours,
    



(Signed)
				    Francisco N. Elca
      

      Bo. Katihan, Poblacion
      

      Muntinlupa, Metro Manila
[18]







As
 it turned out, Elca did not own 14 hectares in Bacoor, Cavite.   He 
merely had an inchoate right over the Bacoor property, derived from his 
Application to Purchase Friar Lands, which covered only 7 hectares.
[19]
    Elcaâs application was later amended to cover only 4 hectares, in view of the protest by Alfredo Salenga (Salenga).
[20]

   Clearly, Elca was in no position to transfer ownership of the 
5-hectare Bacoor property at the time petitioners offered it to Lucero.


In 
Alcantara 
v.
 Court of Appeals
,
[21]
  this Court, citing 
People v. Balasa
,
[22]
  explained the meaning of fraud and deceit, 
viz
.:





    [F]raud in its general sense is deemed to comprise anything 
calculated to deceive, including all acts, omissions, and concealment 
involving a breach of legal or equitable duty, trust, or confidence 
justly reposed, resulting in damage to another, or by which an undue and
 unconscientious advantage is taken of another. It is a generic term 
embracing all multifarious means which human ingenuity can device, and 
which are resorted to by one individual to secure an advantage over 
another by false suggestions or by suppression of truth and includes all
 surprise, trick, cunning, dissembling and any unfair way by which 
another is cheated. And deceit is the false representation of a matter 
of fact whether by words or conduct, by false or misleading allegations,
 or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed which 
deceives or is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it 
to his legal injury. 
  





Indubitably,
 petitionersâ parody that Elca owned 14 hectares in Bacoor, Cavite, and 
was offering a 5-hectare portion of it, in substitution of the 
Muntinlupa property, and demanding an additional P2,000,000.00 from 
Lucero, constituted fraud and deceit. 


To
 reiterate, it is an oft-repeated principle that the factual findings of
 the trial courts, including their assessment of the witnessâ 
credibility, are entitled to great weight and respect by this Court, 
particularly when the CA affirms the findings.
[23]

  Considering that there is nothing in the records that shows that the 
factual findings of the trial court and the appellate court were 
erroneous, we affirm their conclusion that petitioners attempted to 
defraud Lucero again.   


Undoubtedly, petitioners commenced the commission of the crime of 
estafa

 but they failed to perform all the acts of execution which would 
produce the crime, not by reason of their own spontaneous desistance but
 because of their apprehension by the authorities before they could 
obtain the amount. Since only the intent to cause damage and not the 
damage itself had been shown,
[24]
  the RTC and the CA correctly convicted petitioners of attempted 
estafa
.


On
 the penalty.  The RTC sentenced petitioners to an imprisonment term of 
ten (10) years and one (1)  day to twelve years.  The CA modified it to 
six (6) months of 
arresto mayor
, as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of 
prision correccional
, as maximum.


Petitioners and the OSG both argue that the penalty imposed by the CA was wrong, and plead for its modification.


The penalty for 
estafa
 depends on the amount defrauded. Thus, if the crime of 
estafa
 had been consummated, Lucero would have been defrauded in the amount of  P100,000.00.
[25]
  Hence, the applicable penalty under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) would have been 
prision correccional

 in its maximum period to prision mayor in its minimum period, with an 
additional one (1) year for every P10,000.00 in excess of the first 
P22,000.00; provided, that the total penalty should not exceed twenty 
years.


Since what was established was only attempted 
estafa
,
 then the applicable penalty would be that which is two degrees lower 
than that prescribed by law for the consummated felony pursuant to 
Article 51,
[26]
  in relation to Article 61(5),
[27]
  of the RPC.  Accordingly, the imposable penalty would be 
arresto mayor
 in its medium period to 
arresto mayor
 in its maximum period,
[28]

  or an imprisonment term ranging from two (2) months and one (1) day to
 six (6) months.  And because the amount involved exceeded P22,000.00, 
one (1) year imprisonment for every  P10,000.00 should be added, 
bringing the total to seven (7) years.


However,
 we agree with the OSG that it would be inequitable to impose the 
additional incremental penalty of 7 years to the maximum period of 
penalty, considering that petitioners were charged and convicted merely 
of attempted and not consummated 
estafa
.  We, therefore, modify the penalty and sentence petitioners to imprisonment of four (4) months of 
arresto mayor
.



WHEREFORE
, the petition is 
DENIED
. The assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 23240 are 
AFFIRMED
. Petitioners Elvira Lateo, Francisco Elca, and Bartolome Baldemor are found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of attempted 
estafa
, and are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of four (4) months of 
arresto mayor
.

 (1) When the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or
 conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd
 or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when 
the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the 
findings of facts are conflicting; (6) when in making its findings the 
Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are
 contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) 
when the findings are contrary to the trial court; (8) when the findings
 are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are
 based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the 
petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; 
(10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of 
evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (11) when the 
Court of Appeals manifestly  
      overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, 
which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. (
