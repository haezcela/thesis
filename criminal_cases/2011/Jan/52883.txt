VELASCO JR., J.:


The Case
This is an appeal from the November 25, 2009 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA G.R. CR No. 31896 entitled 
People of the Philippines v. Nene Quiamanlon y Malog
,
 
which affirmed the July 10, 2008 Decision
[2]
 in Criminal Case Nos. Q-05-135151 and Q-05-135152 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 78 in Quezon City.  The RTC found accused Nene Quiamanlon y Malog (Quiamanlon) guilty of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165 or the 
Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002
.
The Facts
Criminal Case No. Q-05-135151 pertains to the Information filed against Quiamanlon for violation of Sec. 5, Art. II of RA 9165, the accusatory portion of which reads as follows:
That on or about the 15
th
 day of June 2005, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring, confederating with other person whose true name and identity have not as yet been ascertained and mutually helping each other, not being authorized by law to sell, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute any dangerous drug, did, then and there, willfully and unlawfully sell, dispense, deliver, transport, distribute or act as broker in the said transaction, ZERO POINT TWELVE (0.12 gm.) of white crystalline substance containing Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
[3]
On the other hand, in Criminal Case No. Q-05-135152, Quiamanlon was charged with violation of Sec. 11, Art. II of RA 9165, as follows:
That on or about the 15
th
 day of June 2005, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring, confederating with other person whose true name and identity have not yet been ascertained and mutually helping each other, not being authorized by law [to] possess or use any dangerous drug, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and knowingly have in her possession and control, ZERO POINT TWENTY SEVEN (0.27 gm.) of white crystalline substance containing Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous [drug].
CONTRARY TO LAW.
[4]
When arraigned on August 25, 2005, accused Quiamanlon pleaded "not guilty" to the foregoing accusations against her.
[5]
 Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.
During trial, the prosecution presented three witnesses, namely: Police Officer 3 Jerry Villamor (PO3 Villamor), PO3 Noel Magcalayo (PO3 Magcalayo), and PO3 Hector Hernandez (PO3 Hernandez).
[6]
 On the other hand, the defense presented Quiamanlon as its lone witness.
[7]
The Prosecution's Version of Facts
On June 15, 2005, a female confidential informant arrived at the office of the District Anti-Illegal Drugs (DAID) in Camp Karingal, Sikatuna Village, Quezon City and reported the illegal drug activities of a certain "Myrna" within the vicinity of Quezon City. The informant disclosed that she was asked by "Myrna" to look for a buyer of her stuff and to meet her at the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant located in Welcome Rotonda, Galas, Quezon City (KFC Welcome Rotonda) in case she already found one.
Acting on the information given by the informant, DAID Chief Colonel Gerardo B. Ratuita immediately formed a team to conduct a buy-bust operation composed of Police Chief Inspector Arnold Abad as team leader, with PO3 Hernandez, PO3 Magcalayo, PO2 Emeterio Mendoza, PO3 Villamor, PO1 Michael Collado, and PO2 Edmond Paculdar as members.
PO3 Villamor was designated as the poseur-buyer, while the other members served as back-up.  PO3 Villamor was furnished a 500-peso bill with Serial No. XD338194, which he marked with his initials "JV" on the upper portion.
After a short briefing and preparation, the buy-bust team, along with the informant, proceeded to KFC Welcome Rotonda.  PO3 Villamor and the informant waited for "Myrna" in front of said establishment, while the rest of the team positioned themselves within viewing distance to allow them to covertly monitor the operation.
After waiting for about an hour, "Myrna" arrived with a female companion. The informant waved at "Myrna."  When the latter approached them, the informant introduced PO3 Villamor to her as "Kuya Jerry," a prospective buyer of 
shabu
.
Thereafter, PO3 Villamor asked "Myrna" whether she had an "item" with her at that time.  In response, "Myrna" went to the side of the fastfood chain, took out one (1) small heat-sealed plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance from her pocket and showed it to him.
[8]
  But as she did so, two (2) other sachets fell out from the pocket of her pants.
[9]
  When "Myrna" handed the sachet containing a white crystalline substance to PO3 Villamor, the latter, in turn, handed her the 500-peso buy-bust money.
Afterwards, PO3 Villamor removed his earring to signal to his team members that the transaction was already consummated.  PO3 Magcalayo and the other members of the team immediately rushed to the scene and introduced themselves as police officers. PO3 Magcalayo recovered the buy-bust money from "Myrna," while PO3 Villamor recovered the other two (2) plastic sachets also from her.  They then arrested both "Myrna" and her companion, later identified as Saguera Samula y Dalunan (Samula), after informing them of the nature of their offense and their constitutional rights. "Myrna," who was later identified as Nene Quiamanlon, and Samula, as well as the recovered articles, were brought to the station for proper investigation and disposition.
[10]
PO3 Villamor, who maintained custody over the seized sachets, marked the said items in his possession, recorded them in an inventory, and handed them over to the Duty Desk Officer, PO3 Hernandez.
[11]
  PO3 Magcalayo likewise turned over the buy-bust money to PO3 Hernandez, who prepared a Request for Laboratory Examination.  Said request, with the seized sachets, were brought by PO3 Magcalayo to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, where they were received by PO2 Golpo and examined by Engr. Leonard M. Jabonillo, Chemist/Forensic Analyst for the PNP Crime Laboratory.
[12]
 The examinations conducted on the plastic sachets of suspected 
shabu
 yielded positive results for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, as indicated in Chemistry Report No. D-507-2005.
[13]
Version of the Defense
Quiamanlon interposed the defense of denial. She testified that at 7:00 p.m. on June 15, 2005, she was eating at Jollibee, Welcome Rotonda with Samula and the sister of her husband when, suddenly, four men, who identified themselves as policemen, approached and poked their gun at her and told her not to make any move.  She was then brought to Camp Karingal aboard a black FX vehicle.
[14]
According to Quiamanlon, the men were supposedly looking for 
shabu
 from her.  When they arrived in Camp Karingal, PO3 Villamor and PO3 Magcalayo punched her on the thigh and on the arm while forcing her to produce the said 
shabu
. They also forced her to remove her clothes to ensure that she was not hiding it in her underwear.  They also kept on asking her to point to the person who is the alleged source of 
shabu
,
 
but she insisted that she could not name any because she is innocent of the accusations against her. Thereafter, she was brought to the fiscal (prosecutor).
[15]
  On the other hand, her companion, Samula, was released since the latter was able to give the policemen money in the amount of PhP 25,000.
Ruling of the Trial Court
After trial, the RTC, on July 10, 2008, convicted Quiamanlon. The dispositive portion of its Decision reads:
(1) In Criminal Case No. Q-05-135151:
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Court finds accused NENE QUIMANLON [sic] Y MALOG 
GUILTY
 beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of SECTION 5, ARTICLE II of Republic Act 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. She is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and is ordered to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00), Philippine Currency plus the costs of the suit.
(2) In Criminal Case No. Q-05-135152
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the Court finds accused NENE QUIMANLON [sic] Y MALOG 
GUILTY
 beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of SECTION 11, ARTICLE II of Republic Act 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. She is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum to fourteen (14) years and nine (9) months of reclusion temporal as maximum and to pay the fine of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P300,000.00), Philippine Currency plus the costs of the suit.
Considering that the accused is a detention prisoner, her period of detention shall be properly credited in the service of her sentence in strict conformity with the provisions of Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code.
The dangerous drugs submitted as evidence in these cases is hereby ordered to be transmitted to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), for destruction and/or disposition in strict conformity with the provisions of our laws, rules and regulations on the matter.
SO ORDERED.
[16]
On appeal to the CA, Quiamanlon questioned the trial court's decision in convicting her despite the prosecution's alleged failure to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt, as well as its purported failure to establish the chain of custody of the alleged 
shabu
.
[17]
Ruling of the Appellate Court
On November 25, 2009, the CA affirmed the judgment of the RTC.  It ruled that the sale and possession of illegal drugs were adequately established by the prosecution, to wit:
In the instant case, the sale of the illegal substance was adequately established by the testimony of PO3 Villamor who acted as the poseur buyer during the buy-bust operation. Relative to PO3 Villamor's testimony as to his own personal knowledge of the sale that took place was his positive identification of the appellant as the offender. He likewise testified on the other items (
shabu
) which appellant had in her possession. PO3 Villamor's testimony was corroborated by PO3 Magcalayo who testified that after he saw PO3 Villamayor [execute] the pre-arranged signal, they rushed to the scene and arrested the appellant; that right after appellant's arrest, he recovered the buy-bust money from her and brought appellant to the police station for investigation. Thus, the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses established that appellant was caught in the act of selling a sachet containing substances which turned out to be positive for 
shabu
, the arrest, being a result of an entrapment operation conducted by the police operatives on the basis of information received from a confidential informant regarding appellant's illegal trade. On the other hand, the confiscated 
shabu
 found in her possession, being a result of a search incident to her lawful warrantless arrest [is] therefore, admissible in evidence against her.
[18]
 (Citations omitted.)
The CA held that in the absence of proof to suggest that the arresting officers were moved by improper motives, their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credence.
[19]
 Moreover, the appellate court ruled that the chain of custody of the seized prohibited drugs was shown not to have been broken and that the identity of the 
corpus delicti
 had been properly preserved and established by the prosecution.
[20]
The 
fallo
 of the CA Decision reads:
WHEREFORE
, finding no reversible error in the decision appealed from, We hereby 
AFFIRM
 the same and 
DISMISS
 the instant appeal.
SO ORDERED.
[21]
On December 14, 2009, Quiamanlon filed her Notice of Appeal.
[22]
In Our Resolution dated March 17, 2010,
[23]
 We notified the parties that they may file their respective supplemental briefs if they so desired.  Both parties manifested that they were no longer filing a supplemental brief, because their respective briefs before the CA had already taken up all the matters relevant to the case.
The Issues
Accused-appellant Quiamanlon contends in her 
Brief 
that:
I
THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN RENDERING A VERDICT OF CONVICTION DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
II
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO ESTABLISH THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY OF THE ALLEGED 
SHABU
.
Our Ruling
We sustain Quiamanlon's conviction.
Proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt adequately established by the prosecution
We have carefully examined the records of this case and We are satisfied that the prosecution's evidence established the guilt of Quiamanlon beyond reasonable doubt.
Time and again, this Court has held that factual findings of the appellate court affirming those of the trial court are binding on this Court, unless there is a clear showing that such findings are tainted with arbitrariness, capriciousness, or palpable error.
[24]
  In 
People v. Lusabio, Jr.
, 
[25]
 this Court held:
All in all, we find the evidence of the prosecution to be more credible than that adduced by accused-appellant. 
When it comes to credibility, the trial court's assessment deserves great weight, and is even conclusive and binding, if not tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence.
 The reason is obvious. 
Having the full opportunity to observe directly the witnesses' deportment and manner of testifying, the trial court is in a better position than the appellate court to evaluate testimonial evidence properly.  
(Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)
Since Quiamanlon failed to show any palpable error, arbitrariness, or capriciousness on the findings of fact of the trial and appellate courts, these findings deserve great weight and are deemed conclusive and binding.
Significantly, in the prosecution for the crime of illegal sale of prohibited drugs under Sec. 5, Art. II of RA 9165, the following elements must concur: (1) the identities of the buyer and seller, object, and consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment for it.  It is worth noting that what is material to the prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually occurred, coupled with the presentation in court of the substance seized as evidence.
[26]
The foregoing elements were sufficiently established by the prosecution.  PO3 Villamor, the poseur-buyer, testified on the first element, thus:

[30]
As established in PO3 Villamor's testimony, a buy-bust operation took place.  Being the poseur-buyer, he positively identified the seller of a plastic sachet containing a white crystalline substance for a sum of PhP 500.  The seller turned out to be Quiamanlon. Further, aside from substantially corroborating PO3 Villamor's testimony, the testimony of PO3 Magcalayo has shown that a subsequent laboratory examination on the contents of the confiscated plastic sachets confirmed that they are indeed methylamphetamine hydrochloride or 
shabu
.
With respect to the charge of illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Sec. 11, Art. II of RA 9165, the evidence of the prosecution has sufficiently established the elements of the violation, to wit: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.
[31]
Possession of dangerous drugs constitutes 
prima facie
 evidence of knowledge or 
animus possidendi
 sufficient to convict an accused in the absence of a satisfactory explanation of such possession.  Thus, the burden of evidence is shifted to the accused to explain the absence of knowledge or 
animus possidendi
.
[32]
  In the instant case, Quiamanlon failed to discharge such burden.
When Quiamanlon took a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance from her pocket in order to show it to PO3 Villamor, two (2) other sachets containing white crystalline substance fell out of her pocket. Considerably, the owner-possessor of said sachets can be no other than Quiamanlon, who has neither shown any proof of the absence of 
animus possidendi
 nor presented any evidence that would show that she was duly authorized by law to possess them during the buy-bust operation.
Chain of Custody Established
Quiamanlon claims that the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation failed to observe the existing rules in the proper custody of the seized items, thereby casting doubt as to the identity and integrity of the sachets allegedly containing 
shabu
 presented as evidence by the prosecution.
Relying on 
People v. Lim
,
[33]
Quiamanlon insists that "any apprehending team having initial control of said drugs and/or paraphernalia, should immediately after seizure or confiscation, have the same physically inventoried and photographed in the presence of the accused, if there be any, and or his representative, who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof."
[34]
She asserts further that the dangerous drug itself constitutes the very 
corpus delicti
 of the offense, and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction, adding that it is, therefore, essential in these cases that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt.
[35]
Indeed, in every prosecution for illegal sale of prohibited drugs, the presentation in evidence of the seized drug, as an integral part of the 
corpus delicti
, is most material.
[36]
 Thus, it is vital that the identity of the prohibited drug be proved with moral certainty.  The fact that the substance bought or seized during the buy-bust operation is the same item offered in court as exhibit must also be established with the same degree of certitude.
[37]
  It is in this respect that the chain of custody requirement performs its function.  It ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed.
[38]
Contrary to Quiamanlon's assertion, the chain of custody of the seized prohibited drugs was adequately established in the instant case. As determined by the CA:
x x x Going by the records, after the seizure of the drugs from appellant's possession, PO3 Villamor marked them with initials "JV", "JV1" and "JV2", then turned them over to PO3 Hernandez, the Duty Desk Officer assigned on that day at Camp Karingal. An Inventory Report was immediately prepared and subsequently, a laboratory examination of the seized items were conducted upon the request made by PS Gerardo Ratuita. The plastic sachets with the markings of "JV", "JV1" and "JV2", containing white crystalline substance when subjected to a qualitative examination by Forensic Analyst in the person of Engr. Leonard M. Jabonillo, yielded positive results, and turned out to be methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.
[39]
Undeniably, a testimony about a perfect chain is not always the standard as it is almost always impossible to obtain an unbroken chain.
[40]
 What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items. The Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 on the handling and disposition of seized dangerous drugs is clear on this matter, thus:
SECTION 21. 
Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.--
The PDEA shall take
 
charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:
(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; 
Provided
, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted
 
at the place where the search warrant is served; or
 
at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures
; 
Provided, further,
 that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items
 x x x.  (Emphasis supplied.)
An astute perusal of the above-quoted provision of the IRR of RA 9165 readily reveals that the custodial chain rule is not to be rigorously applied, provided "the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team."  Thus, the supposed procedural infirmities alleged by Quiamanlon with regard to the custody, photographing, inventory, and marking of the seized items do not, in any manner, affect the prosecution of the instant case and do not render her arrest illegal or the items seized from her inadmissible.
Moreover, the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved, unless there is a showing of bad faith, ill will, or proof that the evidence has been tampered with.
[41]
 In this case, Quiamanlon bears the burden to show that the evidence was tampered or meddled with to overcome a presumption of regularity in the handling of exhibits by public officers and a presumption that they properly discharged their duties.
[42]
 Failing to discharge such burden, there can be no doubt that the drugs seized from Quiamanlon were the same ones examined in the crime laboratory.  Evidently, the prosecution established the crucial link in the chain of custody of the seized drugs.
Denial as an Inherently Weak Defense
This Court has held consistently that "denials unsubstantiated by convincing evidence are not enough to engender reasonable doubt particularly where the prosecution presents sufficiently telling proof of guilt,"
[43]
 as in the instant case.
The sachet containing the dangerous drug was positively identified by PO3 Villamor during trial as the very sachet containing the white crystalline substance sold and delivered to him by Quiamanlon. Thus, Quiamanlon's denial is self-serving and has little weight in law.
A bare denial is an inherently weak defense
[44]
 and has been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor, for it can be easily concocted but difficult to prove, and is a common standard line of defense in most prosecutions arising from violations of RA 9165.
[45]
 And in the absence of any intent on the part of the police authorities to falsely impute such crime against the accused, the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty stands.
[46]
All told, We uphold the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty and find that the prosecution has discharged its burden of proving the guilt of Quiamanlon beyond reasonable doubt.
