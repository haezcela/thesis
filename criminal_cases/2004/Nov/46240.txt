IN RE: THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS FOR REYNALDO DE VILLA (DETAINED AT THE NEW BILIBID PRISONS, MUNTINLUPA CITY) 
REYNALDO DE VILLA, PETITIONER, JUNE DE VILLA, PETITIONER-RELATOR, VS. THE DIRECTOR, NEW BILIBID PRISONS, RESPONDENT.
DECISION




YNARES-SATIAGO, J.:


This is a petition for the issuance of a writ of 
habeas corpus
 under Rule 102 of the Rules of Court.  Petitioner Reynaldo de Villa, joined by his son, petitioner-relator June de Villa, seeks a two-fold relief: 
First
, that respondent Director of Prisons justify the basis for the imprisonment of petitioner Reynaldo de Villa; and 
second
, that petitioner be granted a new trial.
[1]
 These reliefs are sought on the basis of purportedly exculpatory evidence, gathered after performing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing on samples allegedly collected from the petitioner and a child born to the victim of the rape.
By final judgment dated February 1, 2001, in 
People of the Philippines v. Reynaldo de Villa
,
[2]
 we found petitioner guilty of the rape of Aileen Mendoza, his niece by affinity; sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusiÃ³n perpetua
; and ordered him to pay the offended party civil indemnity, moral damages, costs of the suit, and support for Leahlyn Corales Mendoza, the putative child born of the rape.  Petitioner is currently serving his sentence at the New Bilibid Prison, Muntinlupa City.
As summarized in our Decision dated February 1, 2001, Aileen Mendoza charged petitioner Reynaldo de Villa with rape in an information dated January 9, 1995, filed with the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City.  When arraigned on January 26, 1995, petitioner entered a plea of ânot guilty.â
[3]
During the trial, the prosecution established that sometime in the third week of April 1994, at about 10:00 in the morning, Aileen Mendoza woke up in her familyâs rented room in Sagad, Pasig, Metro Manila, to find petitioner on top of her.  Aileen was then aged 12 years and ten months.  She was unable to shout for help because petitioner covered her mouth with a pillow and threatened to kill her.  Aileen could not do anything but cry.  Petitioner succeeded in inserting his penis inside her vagina.  After making thrusting motions with his body, petitioner ejaculated.  This encounter allegedly resulted in Aileenâs pregnancy, which was noticed by her mother, Leonila Mendoza, sometime in November 1994.  When confronted by her mother, Aileen revealed that petitioner raped her.  Aileenâs parents then brought her to the Pasig Police Station, where they lodged a criminal complaint against petitioner.
[4]
Dr. Rosaline Cosidon, who examined Aileen, confirmed that she was eight months pregnant and found in her hymen healed lacerations at the 5:00 and 8:00 positions.  On December 19, 1994, Aileen gave birth to a baby girl whom she named Leahlyn Mendoza.
[5]
In his defense, petitioner alleged that, at the time of the alleged rape, he was already 67 years old.  Old age and sickness had rendered him incapable of having an erection.  He further averred that Aileenâs family had been holding a grudge against him, which accounted for the criminal charges.  Finally, he interposed the defense of alibi, claiming that at the time of the incident, he was in his hometown of San Luis, Batangas.
[6]
The trial court found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of qualified rape, and sentenced him to death, to indemnify the victim in the amount of P50,000.00, to pay the costs of the suit and to support the child, Leahlyn Mendoza.
[7]
On automatic review,
[8]
 we found that the date of birth of Aileenâs child was medically consistent with the time of the rape.  Since it was never alleged that Aileen gave birth to a full-term nine-month old baby, we gave credence to the prosecutionâs contention that she prematurely gave birth to an eight-month old baby by normal delivery.
[9]
 Thus, we affirmed petitionerâs conviction for rape, in a Decision the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, the judgment of the Regional Trial Court, finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape, is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATIONS that he is sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusiÃ³n perpetua
 and ordered to pay the offended party P50,000.00 as civil indemnity; P50,000.00 as moral damages; costs of the suit and to provide support for the child Leahlyn Corales Mendoza.
SO ORDERED.
[10]
Three years after the promulgation of our Decision, we are once more faced with the question of Reynaldo de Villaâs guilt or innocence.
Petitioner-relator in this case, June de Villa, is the son of Reynaldo.  He alleges that during the trial of the case, he was unaware that there was a scientific test that could determine once and for all if Reynaldo was the father of the victimâs child, Leahlyn.  Petitioner-relator was only informed during the pendency of the automatic review of petitionerâs case that DNA testing could resolve the issue of paternity.
[11]
 This information was apparently furnished by the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) Anti-Death Penalty Task Force, which took over as counsel for petitioner.
Thus, petitionerâs brief in 
People v. de Villa
 sought the conduct of a blood type test and DNA test in order to determine the paternity of the child allegedly conceived as a result of the rape.
[12]
 This relief was implicitly denied in our Decision of February 21, 2001.
On March 16, 2001, Reynaldo de Villa filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration of the Decision, wherein he once more prayed that DNA tests be conducted.
[13]
 The Motion was denied with finality in a Resolution dated November 20, 2001.
[14]
 Hence, the Decision became final and executory on January 16, 2002.
[15]
Petitioner-relator was undaunted by these challenges.  Having been informed that DNA tests required a sample that could be extracted from saliva, petitioner-relator asked Billy Joe de Villa, a grandson of Reynaldo de Villa and a classmate of Leahlyn Mendoza, to ask Leahlyn to spit into a new, sterile cup.
[16]
 Leahlyn readily agreed and did so.  Billy Joe took the sample home and gave it to the petitioner-relator, who immediately labeled the cup as âContainer A.â
Petitioner-relator then gathered samples from four grandchildren of Reynaldo de Villa.  These samples were placed in separate containers with distinguishing labels and temporarily stored in a refrigerator prior to transport to the DNA Analysis Laboratory at the National Science Research Institute (NSRI).
[17]
 During transport, the containers containing the saliva samples were kept on ice.
Petitioner-relator requested the NSRI to conduct DNA testing on the sample given by Leahlyn Mendoza, those given by the grandchildren of Reynaldo de Villa, and that given by Reynaldo de Villa himself.  The identities of the donors of the samples, save for the sample given by Reynaldo de Villa, were not made known to the DNA Analysis Laboratory.
[18]
After testing, the DNA Laboratory rendered a preliminary report on March 21, 2003, which showed that Reynaldo de Villa could not have sired any of the children whose samples were tested, due to the absence of a match between the pertinent genetic markers in petitionerâs sample and those of any of the other samples, including Leahlynâs.
[19]
Hence, in the instant petition for 
habeas corpus
, petitioner argues as follows:
DNA ANALYSIS ON PATERNITY SHOWS CONCLUSIVELY THAT PETITIONER DE VILLA IS NOT THE FATHER OF LEAHLYN MENDOZA; HIS CONVICTION FOR RAPE, BASED ON THE FACT THAT LEAHLYN WAS SIRED AS A RESULT OF THE ALLEGED RAPE, CANNOT STAND AND MUST BE SET ASIDE.
[20]
x x x                          x x x                             x x x
A NEW TRIAL TO CONSIDER NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE IS PROPER AND MAY BE ORDERED BY THIS COURT IN VIEW OF THE RESULTS OF THE DNA TESTS CONDUCTED.
[21]
Considering that the issues are inter-twined, they shall be discussed together.
In brief, petitioner relies upon the DNA evidence gathered subsequent to the trial in order to re-litigate the factual issue of the paternity of the child Leahlyn Mendoza.  Petitioner alleges that this issue is crucial, considering that his conviction in 2001 was based on the factual finding that he sired the said child.  Since this paternity is now conclusively disproved, he argues that the 2001 conviction must be overturned.
In essence, petitioner invokes the remedy of the writ of 
habeas corpus
 to collaterally attack the 2001 Decision.  The ancillary remedy of a motion for new trial is resorted to solely to allow the presentation of what is alleged to be newly-discovered evidence.  This Court is thus tasked to determine, 
first
, the propriety of the issuance of a writ of 
habeas corpus
 to release an individual already convicted and serving sentence by virtue of a final and executory judgment; and 
second
, the propriety of granting a new trial under the same factual scenario.
The extraordinary writ of 
habeas corpus
 has long been a haven of relief for those seeking liberty from any unwarranted denial of freedom of movement.  Very broadly, the writ applies âto all cases of illegal confinement or detention by which a person has been deprived of his liberty, or by which the rightful custody of any person has been withheld from the person entitled theretoâ.
[22]
  Issuance of the writ necessitates that a person be illegally deprived of his liberty.  In the celebrated case of 
Villavicencio v. Lukban
,
[23]
 we stated that â[a]ny restraint which will preclude freedom of action is sufficient.â
[24]
The most basic criterion for the issuance of the writ, therefore, is that the individual seeking such relief be illegally deprived of his freedom of movement or placed under some form of illegal restraint.  If an individualâs liberty is restrained via some 
legal
 process, the writ of 
habeas corpus
 is unavailing. Concomitant to this principle, the writ of 
habeas corpus
 cannot be used to directly assail a judgment rendered by a competent court or tribunal which, having duly acquired jurisdiction, was not deprived or ousted of this jurisdiction through some anomaly in the conduct of the proceedings.
Thus, notwithstanding its historic function as the great writ of liberty, the writ of 
habeas corpus
 has very limited availability as a post-conviction remedy. In the recent case of 
Feria v. Court of Appeals
,
[25]
 we ruled that review of a judgment of conviction is allowed in a petition for the issuance of the writ of 
habeas corpus
 only in very specific instances,  such as when, as a consequence of a judicial proceeding, (a) there has been a deprivation of a constitutional right resulting in the restraint of a person; (b) the court had no jurisdiction to impose the sentence; or (c) an excessive penalty has been imposed, as such sentence is void as to such excess.
[26]
In this instance, petitioner invokes the writ of 
habeas corpus
 to assail a final judgment of conviction, without, however, providing a legal ground on which to anchor his petition.  In fine, petitioner alleges neither the deprivation of a constitutional right, the absence of jurisdiction of the court imposing the sentence, or that an excessive penalty has been imposed upon him.
In fine, petitioner invokes the remedy of 
habeas corpus
 in order to seek the review of findings of fact long passed upon with finality.  This relief is far outside the scope of 
habeas corpus
 proceedings.  In the early case of 
Abriol v. Homeres
,
[27]
 for example, this Court stated the general rule that the writ of 
habeas corpus
 is not a writ of error, and should not be thus used.  The writ of  
habeas corpus
, whereas permitting a collateral challenge of the jurisdiction of the court or tribunal issuing the process or judgment by which an individual is deprived of his liberty, cannot be distorted by extending the inquiry to mere errors of trial courts acting squarely within their jurisdiction.
[28]
 The reason for this is explained very simply in the case of 
Velasco v. Court of Appeals
:
[29]
 a 
habeas corpus
 petition reaches the 
body
, but not the 
record
 of the case.
[30]
  A record must be allowed to remain extant, and cannot be revised, modified, altered or amended by the simple expedient of resort to 
habeas corpus
 proceedings.
Clearly, mere errors of fact or law, which did not have the effect of depriving the trial court of its jurisdiction over the case and the person of the defendant, are not correctible in a petition for the issuance of the writ of 
habeas corpus
; if at all, these errors must be corrected on 
certiorari
 or on appeal, in the form and manner prescribed by law.
[31]
 In the past, this Court has disallowed the review of a courtâs appreciation of the evidence in a petition for the issuance of a writ of 
habeas corpus
, as this is not the function of said writ.
[32]
 A survey of our decisions in 
habeas corpus
 cases demonstrates that, in general, the writ of 
habeas corpus
 is a high prerogative writ which furnishes an extraordinary remedy; it may thus be invoked only under extraordinary circumstances.
[33]
 We have been categorical in our pronouncements that the writ of 
habeas corpus
 is not to be used as a substitute for another, more proper remedy.  Resort to the writ of 
habeas corpus
 is available only in the limited instances when a judgment is rendered by a court or tribunal devoid of jurisdiction.  If, for instance, it can be demonstrated that there was a deprivation of a constitutional right, the writ can be granted even after an individual has been meted a sentence by final judgment.
Thus, in the case of 
Chavez v. Court of Appeals
,
[34]
 the writ of 
habeas corpus
 was held to be available where an accused was deprived of the constitutional right against self-incrimination.  A defect so pronounced as the denial of an accusedâs constitutional rights results in the absence or loss of jurisdiction, and therefore invalidates the trial and the consequent conviction of the accused.  That void judgment of conviction may be challenged by collateral attack, which precisely is the function of 
habeas corpus
.
[35]
 Later, in 
Gumabon v. Director of the Bureau of Prisons
,
[36]
 this Court ruled that, once a deprivation of a constitutional right is shown to exist, the court that rendered the judgment is deemed ousted of jurisdiction and 
habeas corpus
 is the appropriate remedy to assail the legality of the detention.
[37]
 Although in 
Feria v. Court of Appeals
[38]
 this Court was inclined to allow the presentation of new evidence in a petition for the issuance of a writ of 
habeas corpus
, this was an exceptional situation.  In that case, we laid down the general rule, which states that the burden of proving illegal restraint by the respondent rests on the petitioner who attacks such restraint.  Where the return is not subject to exception, that is, where it sets forth a process which, on its face, shows good ground for the detention of the prisoner, it is incumbent on petitioner to allege and prove new matter that tends to invalidate the apparent effect of such process.
[39]
In the recent case of 
Calvan v. Court of Appeals
,
[40]
 we summarized the scope of review allowable in a petition for the issuance of the writ of 
habeas corpus
. We ruled that the writ of 
habeas corpus
, although not designed to interrupt the orderly administration of justice, can be invoked by the attendance of a special circumstance that requires immediate action.  In such situations, the inquiry on a writ of 
habeas corpus
 would be addressed, not to errors committed by a court within its jurisdiction, but to the question of whether the proceeding or judgment under which a person has been restrained is a complete nullity.  The probe may thus proceed to check on the power and authority, itself an equivalent test of jurisdiction, of the court or the judge to render the order that so serves as the basis of imprisonment or detention.
[41]
 It is the 
nullity
 of an assailed judgment of conviction which makes it susceptible to collateral attack through the filing of a petition for the issuance of the writ of 
habeas corpus
.
Upon a perusal of the records not merely of this case but of 
People v. de Villa
, we find that the remedy of the writ of 
habeas corpus
 is unavailing.
First, the denial of a constitutional right has not been alleged by petitioner.  As such, this Court is hard-pressed to find legal basis on which to anchor the grant of a writ of 
habeas corpus
.  Much as this Court sympathizes with petitionerâs plea, a careful scrutiny of the records does not reveal any constitutional right of which the petitioner was unduly deprived.
We are aware that other jurisdictions have seen fit to grant the writ of 
habeas corpus
 in order to test claims that a defendant was denied effective aid of counsel.
[42]
 In this instance, we note that the record is replete with errors committed by counsel, and it can be alleged that the petitioner was, at trial, denied the effective aid of counsel.  The United States Supreme Court requires a defendant alleging incompetent counsel to show that the attorneyâs performance was deficient under a reasonable standard, and additionally to show that the outcome of the trial would have been different with competent counsel.
[43]
 The purpose of the right to effective assistance of counsel is to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial.
[44]
The U.S. Supreme Court asserts that in judging any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, one must examine whether counselâs conduct undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process to such an extent that the trial did not produce a fair and just result.
[45]
 The proper measure of attorney performance is âreasonableâ under the prevailing professional norms, and the defendant must show that the representation received fell below the objective standard of reasonableness.
[46]
 For the petition to succeed, the strong presumption that the counselâs conduct falls within the wide range or reasonable professional assistance must be overcome.
[47]
In the case at bar, it appears that in the middle of the appeal, the petitionerâs counsel of record, a certain Atty. Alfonso G. Salvador, suddenly and inexplicably withdrew his appearance as counsel, giving the sole explanation that he was âleaving for the United States for an indefinite period of time by virtue of a petition filed in his favor.â
[48]
 In the face of this abandonment, petitioner made an impassioned plea that his lawyer be prevented from this withdrawal in a handwritten âUrgent Motion for Reconsideration and Opposition of Counselâs Withdrawal of Appearance with Leave of Courtâ received by this Court on September 14, 1999.
[49]
 Petitioner alleged that his counselâs withdrawal is an âuntimely and heartbreaking eventâ, considering that he had placed âall [his] trust and confidence on [his counselâs] unquestionable integrity and dignity.â
[50]
While we are sympathetic to petitionerâs plight, we do not, however, find that there was such negligence committed by his earlier counsel so as to amount to a denial of a constitutional right.  There is likewise no showing that the proceedings were tainted with any other jurisdictional defect.
In fine, we find that petitioner invokes the remedy of the petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus
 to seek a re-examination of the records of 
People v. de Villa
, without asserting any legal grounds therefor.  For all intents and purposes, petitioner seeks a reevaluation of the evidentiary basis for his conviction.  We are being asked to reexamine the weight and sufficiency of the evidence in this case, not on its own, but in light of the new DNA evidence that the petitioner seeks to present to this Court.  This relief is outside the scope of a 
habeas corpus
 petition.  The petition for 
habeas corpus
 must, therefore, fail.
Coupled with the prayer for the issuance of a writ of 
habeas corpus
, petitioner seeks a new trial to re-litigate the issue of the paternity of the child Leahlyn Mendoza.
It must be stressed that the issue of Leahlyn Mendozaâs paternity is not central to the issue of petitionerâs guilt or innocence.  The rape of the victim Aileen Mendoza is an entirely different question, separate and distinct from the question of the father of her child.  Recently, in the case of 
People v. Alberio
,
[51]
 we ruled that the fact or not of the victimâs pregnancy and resultant childbirth are irrelevant in determining whether or not she was raped.  Pregnancy is not an essential element of the crime of rape.  Whether the child which the victim bore was fathered by the purported rapist, or by some unknown individual, is of no moment in determining an individualâs guilt.
In the instant case, however, we note that the grant of child support to Leahlyn Mendoza indicates that our Decision was based, at least in small measure, on the victimâs claim that the petitioner fathered her child.  This claim was given credence by the trial court, and, as a finding of fact, was affirmed by this Court on automatic review.
The fact of the childâs paternity is now in issue, centrally relevant to the civil award of child support.  It is only tangentially related to the issue of petitionerâs guilt.  However, if it can be conclusively determined that the petitioner did 
not
 sire Leahlyn Mendoza, this may cast the shadow of reasonable doubt, and allow the acquittal of the petitioner on this basis.
Be that as it may, it appears that the petitioner once more relies upon erroneous legal grounds in resorting to the remedy of a motion for new trial.  A motion for new trial, under the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, is available only for a limited period of time, and for very limited grounds.  Under Section 1, Rule 121, of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, a motion for new trial may be filed at any time before a judgment of conviction becomes final, that is, within fifteen (15) days from its promulgation or notice.  Upon finality of the judgment, therefore, a motion for new trial is no longer an available remedy.  Section 2 of Rule 121 enumerates the grounds for a new trial:
SEC. 2. 
Grounds for a new trial
.âThe court shall grant a new trial on any of the following grounds:
(a) That errors of law or irregularities prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused have been committed during the trial;
(b) That new and material evidence has been discovered which the accused could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial and which if introduced and admitted would probably change the judgment.
In the case at bar, petitioner anchors his plea on the basis of purportedly ânewly-discovered evidenceâ, i.e., the DNA test subsequently conducted, allegedly excluding petitioner from the child purportedly fathered as a result of the rape.
The decision sought to be reviewed in this petition for the issuance of a writ of 
habeas corpus
 has long attained finality, and entry of judgment was made as far back as January 16, 2002.  Moreover, upon an examination of the evidence presented by the petitioner, we do not find that the DNA evidence falls within the statutory or jurisprudential definition of ânewly- discovered evidenceâ.
A motion for new trial based on newly-discovered evidence may be granted only if the following requisites are met: (a) that the evidence was discovered after trial; (b) that said evidence could not have been discovered and produced at the trial even with the exercise of reasonable diligence; (c) that it is material, not merely cumulative, corroborative or impeaching; and (d) that the evidence is of such weight that that, if admitted, it would probably change the judgment.
[52]
  It is essential that the offering party exercised reasonable diligence in seeking to locate the evidence before or during trial but nonetheless failed to secure it.
[53]
In this instance, although the DNA evidence was undoubtedly discovered after the trial, we nonetheless find that it does not meet the criteria for ânewly-discovered evidenceâ that would merit a new trial.  Such evidence disproving paternity could have been discovered and produced at trial with the exercise of reasonable diligence.
Petitioner-relatorâs claim that he was âunawareâ of the existence of DNA testing until the trial was concluded carries no weight with this Court.  Lack of knowledge of the existence of DNA testing speaks of negligence, either on the part of petitioner, or on the part of petitionerâs counsel.  In either instance, however, this negligence is binding upon petitioner.  It is a settled rule that a party cannot blame his counsel for negligence when he himself was guilty of neglect.
[54]
 A client is bound by the acts of his counsel, including the latterâs mistakes and negligence.
[55]
 It is likewise settled that relief will not be granted to a party who seeks to be relieved from the effects of the judgment when the loss of the remedy at law was due to his own negligence, or to a mistaken mode of procedure.
[56]
Even with all of the compelling and persuasive scientific evidence presented by petitioner and his counsel, we are not convinced that Reynaldo de Villa is entitled to outright acquittal.  As correctly pointed out by the Solicitor General, even if it is conclusively proven that Reynaldo de Villa is not the father of Leahlyn Mendoza, his conviction could, in theory, still stand, with Aileen Mendozaâs testimony and positive identification as its bases.
[57]
 The Solicitor General reiterates, and correctly so, that the pregnancy of the victim has never been an element of the crime of rape.
[58]
 Therefore, the DNA evidence has failed to conclusively prove to this Court that Reynaldo de Villa should be discharged.  Although petitioner claims that conviction was based solely on a finding of paternity of the child Leahlyn, this is not the case.  Our conviction was based on the clear and convincing testimonial evidence of the victim, which, given credence by the trial court, was affirmed on appeal.
WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition for 
habeas corpus
 and new trial is 
DISMISSED
 for lack of merit.
No costs.

SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION
CARPIO, 
J
.:
I concur with the 
ponencia
.  The DNA evidence presented by petitioner-relator is not material and relevant to the crime of rape.  Even assuming petitioner is not the father of the child that was conceived within the period of the rape, such fact does not prove that petitioner could not have committed the crime.  The remedies of 
habeas corpus
 and new trial are thus unavailing in this case.
However, this case should not close the door to a convicted felon who after final judgment acquires DNA results exonerating him of the crime for which he was convicted.  Legal relief is still available, for instance, to a felon convicted by final judgment of rape who subsequently gains access to DNA results showing that the semen in the victimâs vagina does not match that of the convicted felon.
While final judgments enjoy the presumption of correctness, the confining and traditional legal procedures must respond to the revolutionary way that DNA results have been proving the innocence of convicts. American jurisprudence has shown the way in this regard.
Before the enactment of statutes in some states providing for post-conviction DNA testing, American courts had no precedents to work on to justify post-conviction DNA testing and the reversal of final judgments of conviction when the DNA results turned out to be exculpatory.  Before the passage of the DNA testing statutes, it was unclear under what right and procedure a convict was entitled to post-conviction DNA testing.  Even in the absence of statutes, American courts allowed post-conviction DNA testing by requiring the convict to apply for such testing before the verdict could be vacated.
[1]
 The application enables the courts to determine the basis for the application and to set the standards in case the request is granted.  Once the DNA result confirms the innocence of the convict, American courts conduct a motion in 
limine
 hearing on admissibility or order a new trial.
[2]
 The prosecution usually refuses to re-try the case and the convict is released.
Under American jurisprudence, post-conviction DNA testing is availed through a petition for 
habeas corpus
 and motion for new trial.  These conventional modes of relief, however, have built-in restrictions that pose problems to the granting of post-conviction DNA testing.
In 
habeas corpus
 cases, relief could not be had unless a constitutional violation was committed during the convictâs trial.  In a motion for new trial, the convict must show that the DNA test is a newly discovered evidence and must not be time-barred to warrant a new trial. Despite these legal obstacles, American courts granted, albeit restrictively, the request for post-conviction DNA testing on a case-by-case basis.  The approach to the legal issues varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
In 
Summerville v. Warden State Prison
[3]
 the Supreme Court of Connecticut ruled that when evidence is so strong that innocence is highly likely and that evidence alone establishes innocence, that in itself is already a basis fro 
habeas corpus
 review of convictions and imprisonment. Thus, 
habeas corpus
 warranted the granting of a new trial based on the petitionerâs claim of actual innocence.  In 
People v. Callace
,
[4]
 the New York court considered post-conviction DNA testing as newly discovered evidence because the type of DNA analysis available at the post-conviction stage was not available at the time of the trial.  In 
State v. Thomas
,
[5]
 fundamental fairness allowed the convict to post-conviction DNA testing even when the request was already stale.
Habeas corpus
 review and new trial proved to be narrow remedies as American courts still adhere to the strict requirements of these two models of relief.  Nonetheless, post-conviction DNA testing has been granted on other grounds.  When the application of DNA testing has strong indications that the result could potentially exonerate the convict, American courts recognized the convictâs right to exculpatory evidence.  In 
Dabbs v. Vergari
,
[6]
 citing 
Brady v. Maryland
,
[7]
 the court categorically upheld the convictâs constitutional right to exculpatory evidence despite the absence of a law providing a right to post-conviction discovery.  DNA results exonerated Charles Dabbs and his conviction was eventually vacated.
[8]
 On other cases,
[9]
 the exculpatory potential of DNA evidence compelled the American courts, in the interest of justice, to allow access to post-conviction DNA testing.
The rectification of a wrong is the underlying reason for the allowance of post-conviction DNA testing and the eventual reversal of the verdict based on exclusionary DNA result.  Even the most stringent of rules have to give way upon a showing that there is a strong probability that DNA result could prove the convictâs actual innocence.  For ultimately, it is the primary duty of the court to prevent the miscarriage of justice.
Every person has a right to avail of a new technology that irrefutably proves his innocence despite a prior final conviction, provided the new technology was not available during his trial.  This right is part of a personâs constitutional right to due process of law.  A person convicted by final judgment does not lose his constitutional right to due process, and he may invoke it whenever there is a compelling and valid ground to do so.
The 1987 Constitution expressly empowers the Court to â[p]romulgate rules concerning the protection and enhancement of constitutional rights.â
[10]
  Even in the absence of a law allowing post-conviction DNA testing, the Court under its constitutional mandate may order a new trial if the post-conviction DNA testing will establish that the convicted felon could not have possibly committed the crime.  This is the case when the post-conviction DNA testing shows that the semen in the victimâs vagina does not match that of the convicted felon.
A new trial on the ground of post-conviction DNA testing is different from a new trial under Rule 121,
[11]
 which is available only before final judgment.  Unlike a new trial under Rule 121, a new trial for post-conviction DNA testing does not vacate the judgment of conviction, which stands until recalled by the court as a result of the new trial.  A new trial after final conviction may be ordered only on the sole ground that DNA testing will establish that the convicted felon could not have committed the crime.  Moreover, DNA testing must not have been available or possible during the original trial.
Thus, I submit that a felon convicted by final judgment who could establish through DNA testing that he could not have committed the crime is not without remedy to prove his innocence and regain his liberty.

 Section 1 of Rule 121 provides: â
New trial or reconsideration
 â At any time before a judgment of conviction becomes final, the court may, on motion of the accused or at its own instance but with the consent of the accused, grant a new trial or reconsideration.â
SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION
CALLEJO, SR., 
J
.:
I concur with the 
ponencia
 and the separate concurring opinion of Justice Antonio T. Carpio that the convicted felon must be allowed an opportunity to adduce DNA evidence.  However, such a remedy is 
sui generis
 to give the convicted felon a chance to adduce DNA evidence until Rule 121 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure is revised anew.  Such a remedy is akin to a motion for a new trial in the original case on the ground of newly discovered evidence under Section 2(b), Rule 121 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which reads:
SEC. 2.  
Grounds for a new trial
. â The court shall grant a new trial on any of the following grounds:
(a) That errors of law or irregularities prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused have been committed during the trial;
(b) That new and material evidence has been discovered which the accused could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial and which if introduced and admitted would probably change the judgment.
