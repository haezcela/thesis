PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ROGELIO LAYUGAN Y FURUC, APPELLANT. 
D E C I S I O N




SANDOVAL-GUTIERREZ, J.:


For automatic review is the Joint Decision
[1]
 dated December 12, 1996 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Cauayan, Isabela in Criminal Cases Nos. 19-970, 19-972 to 19-975, convicting Rogelio Layugan y Furuc, appellant, of five counts of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death in each count and to pay the victim, his very own daughter, P100,000.00 as moral damages.
The five separate Amended Informations filed against appellant have similar allegations (except the dates of commission), charging him as follows:
âThat on or about (
August 25, 1995
 â in Criminal Case No. 19-970; 
August 30, 1995
 â in Criminal Case No. 19-972; 
October 11, 1995 
â in Criminal Case No. 19-973; 
October 18, 1995
 â in Criminal Case No. 19-974; and 
April 21, 1996
 â in Criminal Case No. 19-975), in the municipality of Angadanan, province of Isabela, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused, Rogelio Layugan, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with his own daughter, Evelyn Layugan, a fourteen-year old girl, against her will and consent.
âContrary to Law.â
Upon being arraigned, appellant, assisted by counsel, entered a plea of âNot guiltyâ to each of the crimes charged.   A joint trial commenced thereafter.
The evidence for the prosecution, as culled from the testimonies of Evelyn Layugan, complainant, her mother Josefina Ramones-Layugan, and Dr.    Inocencio Agpaon, may be stated as follows:
Evelyn is the daughter of appellant and Josefina.  The spouses have eleven children, three of them are deceased â the two died a day after their birth, while the 24-year old eldest son, Eriberto, was killed by appellant himself.
[2]
 At the time the crimes were committed, the following children were living with the couple, namely: Charlita (20), an epileptic, Arnel (17), complainant Evelyn (14), Analiza (13), and Gloria (11).
[3]
 The family reside at Barangay Aniog, Angadanan, Isabela.
On 
August 25, 1995
, about 10:00 oâclock in the evening, Evelyn and her sisters Charlita, Analiza and Gloria were at home sleeping in their room.   At that time, their brother Arnel and mother Josefina were in Aglipay, Quirino visiting her ailing mother, Juana Tallud.   Suddenly Evelyn was awakened by the weight of her father on top of her.   Instinctively, she struggled to extricate herself, but he warned her not to shout if she did not want to be harmed.  Overwhelmed with fear as she remembered how he killed her own eldest brother, she just remained still and merely cried.   Then he quickly undressed her and kissed the different parts of her body, forcibly inserting his penis in her vagina.  She felt pain and sensed something was torn inside.  That was the first time she experienced sexual intercourse.
[4]
On 
August 30, 1995
, while Josefina and Arnel were still in Aglipay, Quirino, appellant ravished Evelyn for the second time.  About 12:00 oâclock midnight, while she and her sisters were sleeping in their house appellant removed her dress and underwear.  Before she could shout, he threatened to kill her.  He then proceeded to kiss her body and later on inserted his penis inside her vagina.
[5]
In October 1995, Josefinaâs mother died.  Thus, she and Arnel had to stay again in Aglipay, Quirino to attend the wake.
Taking advantage of his wifeâs absence, appellant sexually abused Evelyn for the third time in their house on 
October 11, 1995
 at 1:00 oâclock in the morning.  That time, while her sisters were sleeping soundly, she woke up when appellant took off her underwear.  However, she âcould not do anythingâ considering his strength.  After he removed her    underwear, he then forcibly shoved his penis into her vagina.  She felt something came out from his penis which he later withdrew.
[6]
For the fourth time, or on 
October 18, 1995
, appellant sexually molested Evelyn.  She cried as she felt helpless against the sexual assault by her own father.
[7]
In the second week of April 1996, appellant and Josefina went to Echague, Isabela to harvest corn in her brotherâs farm.  Only Evelyn and her sister Charlita were left at home.
However, on April 20, 1996, appellant returned home alone.  The 
following day
, around 1:00 oâclock in the morning, Evelyn was roused from her sleep as he was forcibly undressing her.  Once more, she was engulfed with fear and remained motionless.  She merely cried as he easily ravished her for the fifth time.
[8]
That same day (April 21, 1996), Evelyn mustered enough courage and revealed to her mother the traumatic incidents she suffered in the hands of her father.  Without delay, Josefina reported the matter to Barangay Captain Josie Siquian who accompanied them to the police headquarters.  There Evelynâs statement was taken.   It was only this time she confided to her mother what took place in detail since she was so terrified of her fatherâs threat. And she believed her father would kill them because according to her, âhe already killed my eldest brother.â
[9]
 For her part, Josefina confirmed that appellant killed their son and that when he sought her forgiveness and promised to reform, she desisted from pursuing the case against him.
[10]
The following day (April 22), Evelyn was examined by Dr. Inocencio R. Agpaoa, Municipal Health Officer of Angadanan, Isabela.  He issued a Medico-Legal Report/ Certification dated April 22, 1996,
[11]
 stating his findings he confirmed on the witness stand,
[12]
 thus:
âNature Of Incident:
Alleged rape by Evelyn Layuganâs own father.
Pertinent Physical Findings:
Presence of a 
fresh laceration, reddish in appearance, at the lower end portion of her vagina
 located at 4:30 oâclock position.   Also noted was 
old laceration of her hymen at 3:00 oâclock position
.â (Underscoring ours)
Appellant, upon the other hand, interposed the defenses of alibi and denial.  He testified that he could not have committed the crimes charged since he never slept in their house during the dates in question.  At that time, he worked as caretaker of Rebecca Tamaniâs farm situated 
about 100 meters away from his house.
  He further testified that he loves his children and, therefore, could not have sexually abused his own daughter.  He admitted that he killed his own eldest son, Eriberto, resulting in his detention for two years at the Provincial Jail.
[13]
On December 12, 1996, the trial court rendered the appealed Joint Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
âWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations and finding the accused Rogelio Layugan y Furuc guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the five counts of rape charged in the Informations, judgment is hereby rendered sentencing him to suffer the death penalty in each case, or a total of five (5) death penalties, and to indemnify the victim in the amount of P100,000.00 as moral damages.
âSO ORDERED.â
[14]
In his Brief, appellant claims that the trial court committed the following lone error:
âTHE COURT 
A QUO
 ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED FOR THE CRIMES CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.â
Upon the other hand, the Solicitor General, in his Appelleeâs Brief, disputed appellantâs claim and prayed that the trial courtâs Joint Decision be affirmed.
As alleged in the five Amended Informations, four of the crimes charged were committed in 1995 and the fifth one in 1996.  Hence, the law applicable to the cases at bar is Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659,
[15]
 which provides:
âArticle 335. 
When and how rape is committed
. â Rape is committed 
by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
By using force or intimidation;
When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and
When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.
The crime of rape shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.
x x x
The 
death penalty
 shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with 
any of the following attendant circumstances
:
When the 
victim
 is under 
eighteen (18) years of age
 and the 
offender
 is a parent, ascendant, 
step-parent
, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
x x x.â (Underscoring ours)
For the charge of rape to prosper under the above provisions, it is required that (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) he accomplished such act through force or intimidation upon her; or when she is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when she is under 12 years of age or is demented.
[16]
The same provisions categorize rape as either 
simple
 or qualified.  It is 
qualified
 when any of the qualifying/aggravating circumstances which attended the commission of the crime â as when the victim is below 18 years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim â  is alleged in the Information and proven during trial.
[17]
 A finding of qualified rape raises the penalty to death.
In a prosecution for rape, the complainantâs credibility is the single most important issue.  When her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted solely on the basis thereof.
[18]
We have scrutinized with great caution Evelynâs testimony, fully mindful of the well-established guiding principles in the adjudication of rape cases that an accusation of rape can be made with facility, but more difficult for the accused to disprove it;
[19]
 hence, the victimâs testimony must not be received with precipitate credulity.
[20]
We find that the prosecution has sufficiently and convincingly proved that appellant, on five occasions, 
had carnal knowledge of Evelyn through force or intimidation
.  We quote the following pertinent portions of her testimony:

 (Underscoring ours)
 
 
Evelynâs story of her harrowing experiences in the hands of appellant, her own father, exhibits the marks of a credible testimony coming from a truthful witness and, therefore, must be given full faith and credit.  She exuded an unmistakable aura of complete innocence and simplicity as a barrio lass, obviously unexposed to worldly lusts, as indicated by her curt but frank and straightforward answers to the questions describing how she was sexually abused five times by her father.  She was definitely sincere and forthright when she declared that on August 25 and 30, 1995, October 11 and 18, 1995, and April 21, 1996, appellant, in order to satisfy his bestial desires, used forced and intimidation when he undressed her, removed her underwear, and 
inserted his penis inside her vagina
.  Her boldness in facing a public trial, unmindful of the humiliating ordeals she unfolded as she positively identified her own father as the perpetrator, obviously demonstrates her genuine desire to seek justice.
It bears stressing that Evelynâs account was reinforced by physical evidence.  The Medico-Legal Report and testimony of Dr. Inocencio Agpaoa, who physically examined her on April 22, 1996, or a day after the fifth rape incident (April 21), show that her genital has (1) a fresh laceration, reddish in appearance, at the lower end portion of the vagina located at 4:30 oâclock position, and (2) an old hymenal laceration at 3:00 oâclock position.  The lacerations and pain Evelyn suffered in her genital could be nothing but the result of penile penetration showing that appellant had carnal knowledge of her.
[26]
We are thus convinced beyond reasonable doubt that Evelyn was telling the truth.  We have consistently held that no decent lass will publicly cry rape, particularly against her father, if such were not true.
[27]
 Courts usually accord great weight to the testimony of the victim of sexual assault, particularly in cases of incestuous rape, because no woman would be willing to undergo a public trial, along with the shame, humiliation and dishonor of exposing her own degradation, were it not to condemn an injustice and to have the offender apprehended and punished.
[28]
 Too, it is highly unnatural for a mother (such as Josefina in this case), virtuous or not, to influence her own daughter to concoct a story which would put her own father for most of his remaining life in jail, if not put him to his death, and drag herself and the rest of her family to a lifetime of shame.
[29]
Appellant wants us to doubt Evelynâs version, contending that it is simply incredible because âit is difficult to comprehend how he could perpetrate the alleged bestial acts (in the same room where her sisters were then sleeping) without any of them being awakened.â He added that Evelynâs testimony that her sisters were then fast asleep âwas contrary to human experience and natural course of things.â
[30]
We are not swayed by appellantâs arguments.
It has been oft said that lust is no respecter of time or place.
[31]
 Neither the crampness of the room, nor the presence of other people therein, nor the high risk of being caught, has been held sufficient and effective obstacles to deter the commission of rape.
[32]
 Jurisprudence is replete with rulings that rape can be committed in places where people congregate, in parks, alongside the road, within school premises, inside a house where there are other occupants, and even in the same room where there are other members of the family who are sleeping.
[33]
In the case at bar, it is understandable that Evelynâs sisters were not awakened when appellant sexually assaulted her on those five occasions.  She testified that it was only on the first rape incident that she attempted to resist his bestial attack, but she stopped when he threatened to harm her.  She was thus cowed to submit 
quietly
 to his lust since she was overwhelmed with fear when she recalled how he killed her own eldest bother.
Moreover, contrary to appellantâs assertion, it is not impossible for him to rape her very own daughter.  In 
People vs. Palero
[34]
 and 
People vs. Makilang
,
[35]
 we noted, with sadness and disdain, the âincreasing frequencyâ of rape cases elevated to this Court where fathers molest and defile the innocence of their own flesh and blood.
Anent appellantâs defenses of denial and alibi, the same utterly failed to show that he could not have committed the crimes charged.  Both defenses are intrinsically weak.  Denial is a negative and self-serving assertion that cannot overcome the victimâs affirmative, categorical, and convincing testimony.
[36]
 Also, his alibi can easily be fabricated, and for it to prosper, it must be established by positive, clear and satisfactory proof that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission and not merely assert that he was somewhere else.  
Physical impossibility
 refers to the distance between the place where the accused was when the crime happened and the place where it was committed, as well as the facility of the access between the two places.
[37]
Here, the element of physical impossibility is absent since appellantâs place of work is merely 
about 100 meters
 away from his house.   Obviously, he could easily reach home anytime to perpetrate the crimes charged.
However, we find that the trial court erred in finding appellant guilty of 
qualified
 rape and in imposing the death penalty in each case.  While the five Amended Informations sufficiently allege that Evelyn was 14 years of age when appellant, her own father, committed the crimes charged, however, the prosecution failed to prove her actual age.  Evelynâs Certificate of Live Birth, the best evidence to prove her age,
[38]
 was never offered in evidence.  Josefina merely declared that Evelyn was 14 years old when appellant committed the crimes, without 
even stating the date she was born
.  Certainly, such declaration does not satisfy the requirement that the victimâs age must be proved with certainty as the crime itself.
[39]
As stated earlier, for qualified rape to prosper, both the qualifying circumstances of the victimâs minority (below 18 years of age) and her relationship with the offender (father) must be alleged in the Information and proved during trial.  Absent such proof of the victimâs minority, as in these cases, appellant can only be convicted of five counts of 
simple
 rape and meted the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 in each count.
[40]
With respect to the civil aspect of the crime, the trial court likewise erred in awarding the victim only moral damages of P100,000.00.  Current jurisprudence requires that upon a finding of the fact of rape, the award of civil indemnity in the sum of P50,000.00 is mandatory.  Here, the victim should be entitled to P50,000.00 for each count of simple rape.
[41]
Additionally, we award the victim moral damages of P50,000.00 in each count of simple rape, without need of pleading or proof of the basis thereof since the anguish and pain she has endured are evident.
