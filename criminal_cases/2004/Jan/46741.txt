reclusion perpetua
 in Criminal Cases Nos. U-8266 and U-8341, and the supreme penalty of death in Criminal Cases Nos. U-8342 and U-8343.

Ligot, against her will, to her damage and prejudice.
âCONTRARY to Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code.â
Upon arraignment, appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to each charge.  Thereafter, a joint trial ensued.
The evidence for the prosecution shows that complainant Janice C. Ligot was born on August 29, 1980 as shown by her Certificate of Baptism.
[2]
 She is the only daughter of spouses Delfin and Julita Ligot who are separated.   Since her childhood until April 3, 1994, Janice was living with her aunt, Marie Ligot, who acted as her mother, in Bobonan, Pozorrubio, Pangasinan.  Janiceâs brothers, Ronald (19) and Rodel (17), have been living with their grandparents Cecilio and Clara Ligot, also in Bobonan.   Among those staying with them are appellant Eduardo Limos, Janiceâs uncle by affinity, he being the husband of her aunt Myrna Ligot, who has been in the United States for the last five years.  She left their young sons, Tyrone and Terrence, under appellantâs care.
[3]
On August 9, 1993, at about 1:00 oâclock in the afternoon, Janice was alone in her aunt Marieâs house watching television.
[4]
 Suddenly, appellant entered the house through the kitchen door.  She asked him what he needed, but he did not answer.  She repeated her question, however, he remained silent.  Suddenly, he grabbed her hands and pulled her inside a room.  She fought back and shouted three times, â
Tulungan nâyo ako!,
â but he pointed a knife at her neck, threatening to kill her. While inside the room, appellant boxed her on the thighs and pushed her to the bed.  Then he took off his pants and brief.  She again fought back when he was removing her shorts and panty.  But again he pointed the knife at her.  Then he placed himself on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina, making a push-and-pull movement which lasted for three minutes.  She attempted to shout but he covered her mouth with his hand.  When he withdrew his penis, she saw a yellowish sticky substance coming out from his organ.  She felt pain and observed that her vagina was bleeding.  Moments later, he directed her to put on her panty and warned her not to tell anybody what transpired, or else he would kill her.
[5]
 She kept mum about the incident because she was scared.
[6]
Four days after, or on August 13, 1993, at around 1:30 in the afternoon, while Janice was on her way to Bobonan High School, her grandmother called her to give her allowance.  She was about to leave her grandmotherâs house when she met appellant in front of his room.  He suddenly pulled her inside.  She resisted and shouted but he covered her mouth with his hand.  Then he hit her stomach causing her to fall.  He carried her to the bed, poking his knife at her.  She inquired why he was molesting her when they are relatives, but he did not answer.  Instead, he removed her panty and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina and made a push-and- pull movement.  It was painful.  He again warned her not to reveal what happened to anybody, or else he would kill her.  Thereafter, she wore her panty and went to school.
[7]
 She did not disclose the incident to anyone out of fear.
[8]
On April 3, 1994, upon her aunt Marieâs request, Janice transferred to her grandparentsâ house, where appellant lives, to assist her old grandfather who was sickly and could not walk.
[9]
On August 15, 1994, Janiceâs grandmother and aunt Filomena went to Urdaneta, Pangasinan, leaving her and appellant in the house.  Janice had no classes that day.  At about 10:00 oâclock in the morning, while she was preparing lunch, appellant suddenly pulled her to his room.  Thereupon, she shouted, âGrandfather, help me!â but he pressed her jaw.   Then he boxed her.  He then removed his shorts and brief and inserted his penis into her vagina, making a push-and-pull movement.  She was hurt.  Once more he threatened to kill her if she reveals the incident to anybody.  At around 2:00 oâclock in the afternoon, her aunt Filomena and her grandmother arrived, but she just kept silent because of his threat.
[10]
Two days after, or on August 17, 1994, at about 1:00 oâclock in the afternoon, Janice changed her clothes after washing the dishes, as she intended to go back to school.  Her grandparents and her aunt Filomena were inside their rooms, while her aunt Remedios went to the house of her aunt Linda.  Again, appellant forced Janice to go to his room.  Once inside, he pushed her to the bed.  She resisted vigorously but he boxed her thighs.  He then removed his shorts and brief.  She tightly held her panty but appellant was able to remove it.  Immediately, he placed himself on top of her, spread her legs and once more, he had carnal knowledge of her.  She suffered pain and cried.  Somehow she managed to go to school.
On August 19, 1994, Janice mustered enough courage and revealed her traumatic experiences to her aunt Filomena.  They then reported the incidents to the police.  Thereafter, Janice was physically examined by Dr. Isidora Quirimot of the Community Hospital of Pozorrubio, Pangasinan.  In her Medico-Legal Report dated August 27, 1994, Dr. Quirimot stated that Janice has old lacerations in the hymen at 4, 6 and 9 oâclock positions.
[11]
Appellant vehemently denied the charges against him claiming that everytime Janice went to the house where he stays, she would embrace and caress him.  Their affair started in September 1993 when, at about 7:00 oâclock in the evening, she entered his room and seduced him.  Being a man whose wife was then in the US, he easily succumbed to her advances.  They had sexual intercourse.  He was surprised to find that she was no longer a virgin.  From then on, everytime the other occupants of the house were not around, she would enter his room to have sex with him.   They were sweethearts until August 17, 1994.  He was arrested on August 27, 1994, and he does not know any reason why Janice filed these cases against him.
[12]
Emilia de Vera, appellantâs mother, testified that she stayed in the house of Janiceâs grandparents from May 1993 to December 1993 to help him in the household chores.
[13]
 She noticed that Janice was very close to appellant because he gave her money.  One time, she asked Janice, âWhy are you in that room?â And she replied, âI am asking money from Eduardo Limos.â
On rebuttal, Janice vehemently denied the testimonies of appellant and Emilia that she (Janice) had been entering his room to ask money from him.  She also claimed as totally false appellantâs statements that they were sweethearts and that she actually consented to have sex with him in those four (4) incidents in question.
[14]
On July 25, 1995, the trial court rendered a Joint Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
âWHEREFORE, this Court finds the accused EDUARDO LIMOS y DE VERA:
â
With respect to Criminal Case No. U-8266
:
âGUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE committed with the use of a deadly weapon, but due to the prohibition under Section 19(1), Art.

LIGOT the amount of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages; and to pay the costs.
â
In connection with Criminal Case No. U-8341
:
âGUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of RAPE committed with the use of a deadly weapon, however, due to the prohibition under Section 19(1), Art.

â
As to Criminal Case No. U-8343

âPenultimately, it is said â
Dura lex, sed lex
,â interpreted as âThe law is harsh, but that is the law.â
âSO ORDERED.â
[15]
Appellant, in his brief, ascribes to the trial court the following errors:
âI
THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE TESTIMONIES OF THE RAPE VICTIM AND IN DISREGARDING THE DEFENSE OF THE ACCUSED.
âII
THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE.
âIII
ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED, THE ACCUSED SHOULD ONLY BE FOUND GUILTY OF QUALIFIED SEDUCTION.â
The law applicable to the cases at bar is Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, the pertinent portions of which provide:
âArt. 335.
  
When and how rape is committed
. â Rape is committed 
by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
By using force or intimidation;
When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and
When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.
âThe crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.
âWherever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.
x x x
âThe death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
 x x x.â (Underscoring ours)
The elements of rape under the above provisions are: (1) 
the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim;
 and (2) 
such act was accomplished through force or intimidation;
 or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the victim is under 12 years of age.
Appellant contends that Janiceâs narrations on how the rape incidents were committed are âbasically similarâ and âhave no major variations.â  He claims âthere was no evidence whatsoever that she sustained injuries on account of the rape.â Also, the fact that she did not stay away from him despite the first two incidents belie her claim of sexual abuse.  Thus, âher versions only generate the suspicion that such are fabricated stories.â
[16]
We are not convinced.
In determining the guilt or innocence of the accused in cases of rape, the courts have been traditionally guided by three settled principles, namely: (a) an accusation for rape is easy to make, difficult to prove and even more difficult to disprove; (b) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with utmost caution; and (c) the evidence of the prosecution must stand on its own merits and cannot draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.
[17]
Janice narrated on the witness stand how appellant sexually abused her in a manner reflective of honest and unrehearsed testimony, thus:

[21]
 
 
Complainantâs testimony reveals every relevant detail of the rape incidents.  She remained steadfast in her assertion that it was appellant who raped her through force and intimidation and with the use of a knife.  In fact, he himself testified that he does not know of any ill-motive why she filed these cases against him.   We have consistently ruled that where, as here, the rape victims are young and of tender age, their testimonies deserve full credence and should not be so easily dismissed as a mere fabrication, especially where they have absolutely no ill-motive to testify against the accused.
[22]
 Clearly, far from appellantâs contention that the charges are fabricated, Janiceâs story of defloration is undoubtedly credible and convincing.  The trial court correctly accorded full weight and credence to her testimony, thus:
âContrapuntal to the issue of credibility, this Court observes the demeanor of the complainant when she hurled her emotional anguish and intense rage because of the savage acts done upon her person by the accused, that her testimony in open Court is candid, straightforward and bears the earmarks of truth though there was a sign of shyness and demure on her part during the ten (10) times that she was at the witnessâ stand, four (4) times for the direct examination and six (6) instances during the grueling cross-examination conducted by the accusedâs counsel.  On the other hand, the accused equivocal answers are preposterous, fallacious and farcical.â
[23]
It is doctrinally settled that the factual findings of the trial court which are supported by evidence, especially on the credibility of the rape victim, are accorded great weight and respect and will not be disturbed on appeal.  This is because the trial court has the advantage of observing the victimâs demeanor, such as the angry flush of an insisted assertion, the sudden pallor of a discovered lie, the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer, the forthright tone of a ready reply, the furtive glance, the blush of conscious shame, the hesitation, the yawn, the sigh, the candor or lack of it, or the scant or full realization of the solemnity of an oath.
[24]
Appellant also casts doubt on Janiceâs claim that he inflicted injuries on her during the rape incidents.  He noted that the examining physician failed to report any trace of injuries in any part of her body.
The argument is misplaced.
It is settled that proof of external injuries inflicted on the rape victim is not indispensable in a prosecution of rape committed with force or violence.
[25]
 There is truth in Janiceâs testimony that appellant was able to rape her by threatening to kill her with a knife.  This constitutes the force and intimidation which makes the act of sexual intercourse rape.
[26]
Appellant further asserts that the natural tendency of a rape victim is to distance herself from her rapist.  But here, Janice even moved to her grandmotherâs house where he is staying.
Again, we are not persuaded.  It must be stressed that it was Janiceâs aunt Marie Ligot who instructed her to transfer to her grandparentsâ house so she could help her grandmother in taking care of her sickly husband who could not walk without any assistance.  Being only 13 and under her auntâs parental authority, Janice had to obey her aunt.  Besides, in many instances, rape can be committed even in places where people congregate: in parks, along the roadside, within the school premises and 
even inside a house where there are occupants
.  Indeed, lust is no respecter of place or time.
[27]
Neither are we convinced by appellantâs claim that he and Janice were then sweethearts and that when no one was around in their house, she would oftentimes enter his room and have sex with him.
A âsweetheart defense,â to be credible, should be substantiated by some documentary or other evidence of the relationship â live mementos, love letters, notes, pictures and the like.
[28]
 Here, no such evidence was presented by appellant.  Clearly, his alleged romantic relation with Janice was just a figment of his imagination.
Granting that Janice and appellant were sweethearts and that she voluntarily consented to have sex with him, her most natural reaction would be to conceal this fact as it would bring disgrace to her honor and reputation as well as to her family.
[29]
Assuming further that they were lovers, it does not mean that appellant could not rape Janice.  Such a relationship is not a guaranty that he will not assault and tarnish that which she holds so dearly and trample upon her body and dignity.  Indeed, a sweetheart can be forced to engage in sexual intercourse against her will.
[30]
Appellant also faults the trial court in not finding that he is guilty only of qualified seduction considering that Janice was only 13 years old and had âconsented to their sexual trystâ at their common house.
[31]
We disagree.  Suffice it to say that, as clearly shown above, the elements of rape have been duly established by the prosecution evidence.
Considering that appellant committed the crimes with the use of a deadly weapon, a qualifying circumstance,
[32]
 the prescribed penalty is 
reclusion perpetua
 to death, pursuant to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, quoted earlier.  Corollarily, Article 63 of the same Code provides:
âArt. 63. 
Rules for the application of indivisible penalties
. â  In all cases in which the law prescribes a single indivisible penalty, it shall be applied by the courts regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may have attended the commission of the deed.
â
In all cases in which the law prescribes a penalty composed of 
two indivisible penalties
, the following rules shall be observed in the application thereof:
â1. When in the commission of the deed there is present only one aggravating circumstance, the greater penalty shall be applied.
 â2.
 
When there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the deed, the 
lesser penalty
 shall be applied.
â3. When the commission of the act is attended by some mitigating circumstance and there is no aggravating circumstance, the lesser penalty shall be applied.
â4. When both mitigating and aggravating circumstances attended the commission of the act, the courts shall reasonably allow them to offset one another in consideration of their number and importance, for the purpose of applying the penalty in accordance with the preceding rules, according to the result of such compensation.â  (Underscoring ours)
In 
People vs. Joel Ayuda
,
[33]
 we held: âWhere no aggravating circumstance is alleged in the information and proven during the trial, the crime of rape through the use of a deadly weapon may be penalized only with 
reclusion perpetua
, not death.â  Here, the prosecution failed to allege in the Informations and prove during the trial any aggravating or mitigating circumstance.  The use of a deadly weapon was alleged in the Informations merely as a qualifying circumstance.  Hence, pursuant to Article 63 (2) of the Revised Penal Code, the lesser penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 should be imposed upon appellant for each of the four (4) counts of rape.
[34]
We observe that the trial court imposed the death penalty on appellant in Criminal Cases Nos. U-8342 and U-8343 reasoning that the crimes committed by appellant are qualified rapes, the victim being below 18 years of age and the niece of the offender.
The trial court is in error.  In 
People vs. Ocumen
,
[35]
 we ruled that for rape to be considered qualified by the presence of the qualifying circumstance of 
minority
 of the victim and her 
relationship
 with the offender, the same must be 
specifically alleged
 in the Information and 
duly proven
 with equal certainty as the crime itself.  Here, the four Informations do not allege the minority of Janice and her relationship with the appellant.   Thus, the death penalty cannot be imposed upon him.
With respect to the appellantâs civil liability, we note that the trial court awarded only moral damages of P50,000.00 in each case.  While such award is correct, the victim is also entitled to P50,000.00 as indemnity 
ex delicto
.  Such award is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape.
[36]
In addition, she is also entitled to exemplary damages because the rape was committed with the use of a deadly weapon.
[37]
 In 
People vs. Silverio Montemayor
,
[38]
 we declared: âx x x exemplary damages are justified under Article 2230 of the Civil Code if there is an aggravating circumstance, whether ordinary or qualifying.  Since the qualifying circumstance of the use of a deadly weapon was present in the commission of the rapes subject of these cases, exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00 may be awarded to the offended party in each case.â
WHEREFORE
, the appealed Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 45, Urdaneta, Pangasinan, in Criminal Cases Nos. U-8266, U-8341, U-8342 and U-8343 is hereby 
AFFIRMED
