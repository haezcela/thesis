PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. RODRIGO ALMAZAN, APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




CALLEJO, SR., J.:


This is an appeal from the Decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court of Bangued, Abra, Branch 2, convicting the appellant Rodrigo Almazan of murder and sentencing him to suffer an indeterminate penalty of fourteen (14) years, ten (10) months and twenty (20) days of 
reclusion temporal
, as minimum, to eighteen (18) years of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum. On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) rendered its Decision
[2]
 on February 27, 1998 affirming the decision of the trial court but increasing the penalty to 
reclusion perpetua
.
[3]
 The CA certified the case to this Court pursuant to Section 13, Rule 124 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. The Court accepted the case.
The appellant was charged with murder in an Information, the accusatory portion of which reads as follows:  
That on or about the 14
th
 day of May 1989, at around 9:00 oâclock in the morning, at Barangay Calaba, in the municipality of Bangued, province of Abra, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, and while armed with a firearm (unrecovered), did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot one LORETO APOLINAR several times, hitting him on the head and other parts of his body, which caused his death shortly thereafter, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the victim.
[4]
The appellant was duly arraigned, assisted by counsel, and entered a plea of not guilty.
[5]
The Case for the Prosecution
The first witness of the prosecution was Felimar Apolinar who testified that her husband Loreto Apolinar worked as a weaver.
[6]
 In the morning of May 14, 1989, she and Loreto were taking a bath at the Abra River, Barangay Calaba, about 45 meters away from their house. She also washed clothes. By 9:00 a.m., they decided to go home. From the river, they trekked by a narrow trail. She carried a basin by her side full of washed clothes. Loreto, who was naked from waist up, was ahead of her by 9 meters.
[7]
 Suddenly, Rodrigo (Odit) Almazan, who was armed with a foot-long firearm,
[8]
 jumped from the hill at Loretoâs right side and landed slightly at a distance of about a meter from him. Almazan then aimed his gun at Loreto and shot him. The muzzle of the gun was about 2 feet from Loreto. Although already mortally wounded and bloodied, Loreto instinctively fled towards the house of spouses Eriberto and Francisca Sequerra, which was 45 meters away from the place where the appellant first shot Loreto.
[9]
 Almazan, still armed with his gun, pursued Loreto.
[10]
 Felimar followed the two, shouting and pleading in the Ilocano dialect to Almazan, â
Odit, Odit, Odit, donât shoot my husband!
â
[11]
 Almazan ignored her. Loreto managed to enter the house of the Sequerras.
[12]
 Almazan barged inside the house and saw Loreto crawling toward the 
sawali
 wall. Felimar managed to reach the first step of the stairs to the said house but was shocked when Almazan shot Loreto for the second time. Almazan then went out of the house and, upon seeing Felimar at the foot of the stairs, told her, â
You are also one (sic), you want that I will kill you!
â
[13]
 Before Felimar could reply, Almazan fled from the scene. Felimar ran to the house of their neighbor, Patrolman Juanito Blanes of the Bangued Police Station.
[14]
 She reported the shooting to him and sought help. She then lost consciousness and came to her senses only after about 30 minutes.
[15]
 The next day, May 15, 1989, she gave her sworn statement to Pat. Antonio Carpio.
[16]
Patrolman Juanito Blanes testified that on May 14, 1989, between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., he was on board a tricycle on his way to his house at Barangay Calaba when he met Almazan.
[17]
 When he arrived home, he heard two gunshots. After a couple of minutes, Francisca Sequerra arrived in his house, pleading, âBrother, help us because Loreto Apolinar entered our house and he was shot by Rodrigo Almazan.â
[18]
 Blanes took his pistol and left his house to go to the house of the Sequerras.
[19]
 On his way, he met Felimar who also pleaded to him saying, âPlease brother, help us because Rodrigo Almazan killed my husband.â
[20]
 When he arrived at the Sequerrasâ house, Loreto was already dead.
[21]
 He sent someone to report the matter to the Bangued Police Station. Momentarily, Corporal Catalino Buenafe and Lt. Esteban Pangda arrived and conducted an on-the-spot investigation.
[22]
 They also took pictures of the crime scene.
[23]
 One of the pictures showed Loretoâs head protruding through the 
sawali 
wall of the house.
[24]
Francisca Sequerra testified that on May 14, 1989 at 9:00 a.m., she was washing clothes in the Abra River.
[25]
 She was with Monching Bayle, Rening Sequerra and some children.
[26]
 She also saw Loreto and even joked with him.
[27]
 However, she did not see Felimar in the river on that occasion.
[28]
 As she was climbing up to the trail on her way home, Loreto, who was then behind her, pleaded for her help. She saw Loreto bloodied all over. Afraid for her life, she did not help Loreto.
[29]
 The latter passed by her and ran towards their (Sequerrasâ) house. Instead of going home, Francisca opted to proceed to the place where there were several people.
[30]
 Thereafter, she no longer knew what happened to Loreto.
On July 11, 1989, or almost two weeks from the killing, Francisca gave a statement to Staff Sergeant (S/Sgt.) Edgardo C. Dacquel of the 123rd PC Company/Police District I, Camp Juan Villamor, Bangued, Abra. In her statement, she stated that when she was about to reach her house from the river, he heard gunfire and heard Loreto pleading to her, âI am shot, please help me, sister!â Loreto repeated his plea to her as he passed by her and fled to her house. She noticed that Loreto was bloodied all over. When she arrived home, her mother-in-law, Maxima Sequerra, instructed her to report the matter and seek help from the police. She left the house to report the matter to Patrolman Juanito Blanes. Aside from her mother-in-law, Franciscaâs daughter, Maria Sequerra, and her children were also in the house. She did not know who shot Loreto.
[31]
 She testified, on cross examination, that when she reported the matter to Blanes, she did not tell the policeman that it was Almazan who shot Loreto.
[32]
The prosecution presented S/Sgt. Dacquel who identified his Report dated August 31, 1989 on the killing of Loreto by Almazan which S/Sgt. Dacquel submitted to the Provincial Commander/Police Superintendent, Abra PC/INP Command. S/Sgt. Dacquel recommended that:  
10. â¦ Criminal Complaint for MURDER be filed against C2C Rodrigo Almazan PC before the competent military court.
11. â¦ C2C Rodrigo Almazan PC be summarily discharged from the military service, effective upon approval so that his case will be tried in the merits of the civil court. 
[33]
The Provincial Commander concurred with the foregoing recommendation. The order discharging Almazan from the service was approved by the appropriate officer of the military on November 23, 1989.
[34]
Dr. Herminio B. Venus, Medical Specialist I of the Abra Provincial Hospital, testified that he conducted an autopsy on Loretoâs cadaver. He, thereafter, prepared an Autopsy Report containing the following findings:

RODRIGO ALMAZAN
    
Accused-appellant herein, testified as follows:    
As a member of the 135th PC Co, then stationed at the poblacion, Municipality of La Paz, Abra, he performed normal garrison duties, 
e.g.
, guarding, patrolling, etc;  
That he was designated as a member of the daily company guard detail for the whole period, from 5:00 oâclock P.M. May 13, 1989 to 5:00 oâclock P.M. May 14, 1989, as the 2d-relief guard;

First Shift
 [Two (2)-hour guarding]
 
7:00 oâclock P.M. to 9â00 oâclock P.M. May 13, 1989;
 
Second Shift
 [Two (2)-hour guarding]
 
1:00 oâclock A.M. to 3:00 oâclock A.M. May 14, 1989;
 
Third Shift
 [Four (4)-hour guarding]
 
9:00 oâclock A.M. to 1:00 oâclock P.M. May 14, 1989
That during his entire tour of duty, he never went outside of camp physically; neither did he ever ask permission to leave his post, or, without permission (abandonment of post), left camp.    
That in the early morning of May 15, 1989, his unit, 135th PC Co (to include himself), moved out from its station at La Paz to the mountainous towns of Malibcong and Daguioman where it launched combat operations against dissidents;    
That he personally participated in the operations from that time (May 15, 1989) up to November 07, 1989, when he was placed under arrest as an accused for the death of Loreto Apolinar; he was escorted to the Provl. Headquarters at the capital town of Bangued and thereby detained for twenty-five (25) days until he was released on bail on December 02, 1989;
[36]
    
The trial court convicted the appellant as charged but sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty. The decretal portion of trial courtâs decision reads:  
WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder without any mitigating or aggravating circumstances and sentences him an indeterminate penalty of Fourteen (14) Years, Ten (10) Months and Twenty (20) Days as minimum to Eighteen (18) Years of 
reclusion temporal
 as maximum; to indemnify the heirs of the late Loreto Apolinar in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) and to pay the cost of this suit.
[37]
The Court of Appeals affirmed the appealed decision but increased the penalty to 
reclusion perpetua
.
[38]
The appellant filed a Supplemental Brief with this Court, contending that:
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT IN LIGHT OF EVIDENCE ON RECORD WHICH RAISES REASONABLE DOUBT AS TO HIS GUILT.
[39]
The appellant harps on the fact that prosecution witness Francisca testified that she did not see Felimar taking a bath nor washing clothes in the Abra River with her husband Loreto. Besides, Felimarâs testimony is incredible and barren of probative weight because it is frontally contradicted by the testimony and sworn statement of Francisca.
[40]
 Felimar could not have run after Loreto and the appellant and reach the house of the Sequerras in time for her to hear the second gunfire from the appellantâs firearm because she was then around eight months pregnant. The house of the Sequerras was about 247 meters from the Abra River. Felimar could not have negotiated the distance of 200 meters from the Sequerrasâ house to the house of Blanes in her physical condition. If she saw the appellant shoot and kill Loreto, certainly, the appellant would have also killed her to eliminate any witness against him. Hence, Felimarâs testimony that the appellant even threatened to shoot her is implausible. The testimony of Felimar is even contradicted by the physical evidence. For, if as claimed by her, Loreto was first shot at around a distance of 2 feet between the gun muzzle and skin, a shotgun blast would have produced a single entry wound although there may be isolated shots causing independent entry. In this case, the first gunshot wound on the chest of the victim produced eight separate and independent entry wounds on the victimâs chest. Such number of entry wounds could only have been caused or produced by a buckshot fired at a muzzle to skin distance of at least ten feet. When police investigators arrived at the scene, they did not even investigate Felimar and did not take her statement thereat. They merely asked her the assailantâs name. The appellant could not have killed Loreto because he was a guard on duty at the PC Camp La Paz, Abra, on May 14, 1989 from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. It was only in November 1989 when he learned, for the first time, that he was a suspect in the killing of Loreto.
The appeal is dismissed.
First. Felimar positively identified the appellant as her husbandâs assailant. When she testified, Felimar declared that the appellant mercilessly shot her husband twice and narrated in great detail how the appellant committed the crime with impunity:

ATTY. ASTUDILLO
Q 
A while ago, when we were asking you how far was your husband to (
sic
) the accused at the time he jumped, you first said less than three meters and then you corrected it, is it not?
A 
Yes, sir.
 
Q 
So at that distance of less than one meter while the accused was on the right side of your husband, that was the time he shot your husband?
A 
Yes, sir.
 
Q 
Madam Witness, you saw actually how your husband was shot according to you on that first burst? Would you please personify yourself as your husband and place the Interpreter as the assailant in the way you saw him when he allegedly shot your husband? With the permission of the Court.
A
 
(The witness demonstrating a firing position towards the left side of the Interpreter with a long firearm.)
 
ATTY. ASTUDILLO
Q 
Could you please be more accurate, Madam Witness. Could you please rise again. You are the accused. Now, you said that the accused jumped on the right side of your husband. Please place the Interpreter as your husband, so you must be on his right side.
A 
(Witness raising her two hands in a firing position, aimed towards the right side of the Interpreter; and the victim and the assailant as placed by the witness, they are directly opposite each other.)
 
Q 
So that is now the correct position of your husband and the assailant at the time the assailant first show (
sic
) the victim?
A 
Yes, sir.
 
 
Q
 Now, you raised your two hands and protruded it about a meter away from the body, is it not?
A 
No, sir. The left hand is slightly bent at the elbow.
 
 
Q 
And you said that your husband and the assailant were less than a meter apart on the right side of your husband, is it not?
A
 Yes, sir.
 
 
Q 
So with your protruding left hand, although slightly bent left elbow, you have consumed about half a meter from your body, is it not?
A
 Yes, sir.
 
 
Q 
Considering likewise that your husband is only about less than a meter away from the assailant, the muzzle of the gun, therefore, was already very close to the side of your husband, is it not?
A 
It is not so near, sir.

Q 
So, Madam Witness, how long after the first burst of gunfire at the trail up to the second burst of gunfire inside the house? How long after?

I cannot estimate, sir.
 
COURT
Q 
Before the first shot was fired, did you hear any conversation between your husband and the assailant?
A 
None, sir.
 
Q 
You did not hear any?
A 
I did not hear any, sir.
 
Q
 
Is it not a fact, Madam Witness, that immediately after the accused and the assailant reached the house of Francing Sequerra, there was an immediate burst of gunfire?
A 
After they had gone inside the house, that was the second shot, sir.
 
Q 
Yes, immediately after they had gone inside the house, there was a burst of gunfire?
A 
Yes, sir.
 
ATTY. ASTUDILLO
Q 
Who was ahead in running, Madam Witness, towards the house of Francing Sequerra, your husband, is it not?
A 
Yes, sir.
 
 
Q 
And according to your testimony, the accused followed suit?
A 
Yes, sir.
 
 
Q 
And they were very close [to] each other running towards the house of Francing Sequerra?
A
 Maybe less than ten meters distance, sir.
 
 
Q
 How about you, you said you followed suit. How far were you? How close were you from the back of the accused, also going to the house of Francing Sequerra?
A 
Maybe less than ten meters also, sir.
 
 
Q 
That house of Francing Sequerra is a one-bedroom house, is it not?
A 
Two, sir.
 
 
Q 
One living room and two bedrooms?
A
 That is what they said because I have not gone on (
sic
) that house.
 
 
Q 
You were still on the ground, according to you, when the second shot was fired inside the house?
A 
I was holding the upper portion of the stairs. I was about to step on the first step when I heard the second shot.
 
 
Q 
How many steps up to the second floor of the house of Francing Sequerra where the second burst of gunfire occurred?
A 
Three steps only, sir.
 
 
Q 
But in the place where you were at the time the second shot was fired, you cannot see your husband, nor the accused, correct?
A 
Yes, sir.
 
 
COURT
Q 
But did you hear the gunfire?
A 
Yes, sir.
[43]
It must be emphasized that on May 15, 1989, or barely a day after the killing of her husband, Felimar gave her sworn statement
[44]
 to Pfc. Antonio Carpio of the Bangued Police Station and gave a detailed narration of how the appellant shot Loreto with a long firearm. The gory killing of her husband was still fresh in her mind. She subscribed and swore to the truth of her statement before Notary Public Ricarte B. Valera. Felimar was a 31-year-old housewife. She finished only Grade VI in the elementary grade. Her testimony and sworn statements are clear, positive and full of details, including the identity of the appellant. Felimar could not have contrived the details of the killing. Indeed, it is most unlikely that Felimar could have narrated all the details of the crime with clarity and lucidity unless she herself was present at the 
situs criminis
 before and during the killing.
[45]
 The testimony of a witness, giving details of a startling incident that cannot easily be fabricated, deserves credence and full probative weight for it indicates sincerity and truthfulness in the narration of events.
[46]
Second. Felimar testified that she was with her husband at the Abra River and described how the appellant first shot her husband when the latter was on his way home and again, when he was inside the Sequerrasâ house. On the other hand, Francisca, a prosecution witness, testified that she did not see Felimar at the river when she washed clothes,
[47]
 and that she did not reach her house and did not seek help from Pat. Juanito Blanes. Significantly, Blanes corroborated Felimarâs testimony when he testified that Francisca arrived at his house asking for his help because the appellant had shot Loreto in her house:

Q 
What happened while you were on your way home?
A
 
I rode on a tricycle and the driver was Marlon Barroga and we met Rodrigo Almazan.
 
Q 
This Rodrigo Almazan whom you claim to have met while you were on your way to your barangay on that particular day, is he the same accused who is now seated there?
A 
The same, sir.
 
Q 
Alright, what happened next after you met the accused?
A 
When I reached home at around thirty (30) minutes after, I heard a gunshot.
 
Q 
How many gunshots or reports did you hear?
A 
Two (2) times (
sic
), sir.
 
Q 
After you heard the two gun reports, what did you do if any?
A 
I tried to determine where the shot came from and in two minutes after, a person by the name of Francing Sequerra came to me and asked for help by saying: â
Manong, arayatenna kami ta simrek diay balaymi ni Loreto Apolinar ta pinaltoogan ni Rodrigo Almazan
.â (Translated as follows: âBrother, help us because Loreto Apolinar entered our house and he was shot by Rodrigo Almazanâ).

Do you know this person Loreto Apolinar whom Francing Sequerra was referring to you when she came to seek your help?
A 
Yes, sir.

A
 I went to get my service pistol then I went out then I met outside Felimar Apolinar, the wife of the victim who sought my help by saying: â

â translated into English as follows: âPlease Brother, help us because Rodrigo Almazan killed my husband.â

Q 
Upon being informed by the wife of the victim Felimar Apolinar, what did you do next, if any?
A
 I went to the crime scene.
 
 
Q
 And what did you find out to (
sic
) the place where the incident transpired?
A 
I found out that Loreto Apolinarâ¦.I saw Loreto Apolinar with his head hanging (
nabalintungog
) down from the house of Francing Sequerra.
 
 
COURT
Q
 Is this Francisca Sequerra the same as Francing Sequerra?
A
 Yes, sir.
[48]
Francisca herself stated in her sworn statement to S/Sgt. Dacquel on July 11, 1989 that from the river she was able to reach her house and, upon the instructions of her mother-in-law, she sped to the house of Blanes and sought his help.
[49]
 The second statement of Francisca belies her testimony that instead of proceeding to her house, she went to another house where there were several people. The trial court disbelieved parts and believed the other portions of Franciscaâs testimony. The trial court cannot be faulted for so doing. It was its duty to determine which portions of the testimony are credible and which portions are not. In 
People v. Quilang
,
[50]
 this Court held that courts may believe one part of the testimony of a witness and disbelieve other parts depending on its inherent credibility or the corroborative evidence in the record. In contrast, Felimar had not committed any material inconsistency in her sworn statement and her testimony before the trial court. The appellant failed to present any witness to corroborate Franciscaâs testimony that Felimar was not in the river when Loreto was taking a bath and she (Francisca) was washing clothes in the river. Likewise, the trial court cannot be faulted for giving full probative weight to the testimony of Felimar.
Parenthetically, S/Sgt. Dacquel, who conducted the investigation on the appellantâs involvement in the killing of Loreto, on orders of the Acting Commanding Officer/District Commander and to whom Francisca gave her sworn statement on July 11, 1989, in his report, noted that:  
â¦ Francing Sequerra, on the other hand, might have also seen or witnessed the tragedy but for fear of being involved or be implicated by the Almazanâs, (sic) she have (sic) turned blind and deaf, so as to save her life and limb. (Autopsy Report of the late Loreto Apolinar hereto attached and marked as Tab-âDâ) 
[51]
Third. Admittedly, when the appellant shot the victim on May 14, 1989, Felimar was eight months on the family way. The distance from the place where the appellant first shot Loreto to the house of the Sequerras was only 45 meters. Completely unmindful of her physical condition and determined to help her husband at all costs, she followed the appellant and Loreto to the house of the Sequerras. There is no evidence that right after the appellant caught up with Loreto at the Sequerrasâ house, the appellant shot Loreto immediately. It is possible that a struggle ensued between Loreto and the appellant even as the former crawled to the 
sawali 
wall of the house and managed to insert his head through the said wall. By the time Felimar reached the first step of the stairs of the house, the appellant gave Loreto the 
coup de grace
 and shot him for the second time, this time on the head.
Fourth. That the appellant ensured the death of Loreto by shooting him twice with a long firearm but did not shoot Felimar is not difficult to believe. The evidence on record shows that the appellant intended and was bent on killing Loreto only. The appellant had no motive to kill Felimar, Francisca, or any of the other people present, for that matter. Indeed, there was no reason for him to kill Felimar. Besides, she was eight months on the family way. The appellant must have thought that although Felimar witnessed the killing of her husband, she would be too petrified to divulge the assailantâs identity, just like Francisca. However, Felimar proved to be of sterner stuff. She was determined to put the appellant behind bars for his dastardly crime.
Despite her condition, it was not physically impossible for Felimar to have trekked the 250-meter distance between the house of the Sequerras and that of Blanes and sought the latterâs help. There is no evidence on how Felimar was able to cover said distance. She could have reached the house of Blanes via a tricycle or other mode of transportation. It is not quite far-fetched that despite her pregnancy, Felimar was able to run from the place where the appellant first shot her husband to the house of the Sequerras, which was only 45 meters, and from there, still managed to go to Blanesâ house, which was only 250 meters away.
The Court observes that the spouses Loreto and Felimar worked in the farm. It is established in the medical field that some pregnant women, even late in pregnancy, have run marathons of considerable distance without apparent harm to themselves or their fetuses:  
In general, it is not necessary for the pregnant woman to limit exercise, provided she does not become excessively fatigued or risk injury to herself or her fetus. The current enthusiasm for jogging has also attracted a number of pregnant women to the endeavor. In fact, several women, even late in pregnancy, have run in marathons of considerable distance without apparent harm to themselves or their fetuses.
[52]
Fifth. The appellant claims that Felimarâs testimony that when he first shot Loreto, the muzzle of the gun was only 1-1/2 to 2 feet from the victim, is belied by physical evidence. He insists that if her testimony were true, then there should have been only a single entry wound. However, the autopsy report showed that Loreto had eight entry wounds on his chest. We do not agree with the appellant. The fact that the victim had been shot by a shotgun at 2 to 3 feet muzzle to skin distance does not preclude the possibility of independent entry. Dr. Pedro Solis notes that:  
Long Range Shot (more than 6 inches skin-muzzle distance):
  
At 2 to 3 feet muzzle-skin distance, there is still a single wound of entry although there may be isolated shots causing independent entry.
[53]
Sixth. As found by the trial court and the CA, which we find supported by the evidence, the prosecution proved that the appellant had an ill-motive to kill Loreto:  
Lastly, the theory of the police that the motive for the killing of the victim is revenge because earlier, the victim, Loreto Apolinar was accused for killing P.C. S/Sgt. Rogelio Almazan, brother of the accused on January 18, 1988, and a criminal complaint for homicide was filed against Loreto Apolinar, the victim in the instant case or I.S. No. 178 of the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of Abra, but the resolution of the fiscal exonerated the then respondent Apolinar, (Exhibit â1â), and the accused in killing the victim was out to revenge his brotherâs death is not farfetched.
[54]
S/Sgt. Dacquel, based on his report, concluded that the appellant killed Loreto to avenge the death of his brother Rogelio Almazan:  
â¦ This is the true fact, but all these facts cannot be admitted by the Almazanâs (sic), who have conceived hatred and taken revenge and killing the brother of Loreto Apolinar, who was hacked and stabbed to death by the Almanzanâs (
sic
). But not yet satisfied with what they have done to the brother of Loreto Apolinar, the Almazanâs (
sic
) have not stopped, not until C2C Rodrigo Almazan succeeded in killing his prime target. With all these facts and circumstances, clearly manifest that C2C Rodrigo Almazan PC of the 135
th
 PC Company, is the killer of the late Loreto Apolinar, as being properly identified/pinpointed by the widow of Loreto Apolinar and who was likewise threatened to be killed by C2C Rodrigo Almazan. â¦
[55]
The Provincial Commander of Abra and the Acting Commanding Officer/District Commander of the Philippine Constabulary agreed with the findings of S/Sgt. Dacquel.
In rejecting the appellantâs defense of alibi, we agree with the encompassing disquisitions of the trial court:  
To fortify his defense of 
alibi
, the accused submitted the following documentary evidence, to wit: Exhibits 3, Morning Report, 4, 5, 6 and 7, disposition and location of troops from May 12 to 14, 1989; Exhibit 9, guard detail and the testimony of witnesses. The time honored albeit weather beaten but still is the prevailing doctrine in this jurisdiction is that 
alibi
 is the weakest defense for the reason that it can easily be concocted and fabricated and for this defense to hold water the physical impossibility for the accused to be at the scene of the crime at the particular hour and day of its commission must be established. The place where the accused claim he was at the time of the commission of the crime is only a scant 10 kilometers away which can be negotiated by land transportation means in 30 minutes. The estimation of witnesses of the approximate time of commission of the crime is 
around
 9:00 oâclock in the morning, the end of the guard duty of the accused in the morning of May 14, 1989. He is to go on guard again at 1:00 oâclock in the afternoon of that day, his last duty. So that between 9:00 oâclock A.M. to 1:00 oâclock P.M. May 14, 1989, he is off duty and the crime was committed at around 9:00 oâclock in the morning of May 14, 1989. It is not really impossible for the accused to be in the vicinity of the scene of the crime at around 9:00 oâclock in the morning of May 14, 1989. But the most damaging evidence against the accused 
viz-a-viz
 his defense of 
alibi
, is his positive identification by the wife of the victim, Mrs. Felimar Apolinar, a neighbor in Calaba, Bangued, Abra, who has known the accused since childhood as the assailant of her husband Loreto Apolinar and the identification by another resident of Calaba, Police Officer Juanito Blanes of the Bangued Police Station, Bangued, Abra, who testified that on his way home to Calaba, Bangued, Abra, he saw between the hours of 8:00 oâclock and 9:00 oâclock in the morning of May 14, 1989, the accused riding on a tricycle driven by one Marlon Barroga. After some 30 minutes from the time he arrived home, Blanes heard the 2 gunshots. He took his service firearm proceeded to the place where he heard the shots to investigate and on the way he met Felimar, wife of the victim who immediately sought his help about the shooting of her husband. 
This 
alibi
 defense and the documents presented in this trial, as official records of the 135 P.C. Company were the subject of investigation by authorities at the Constabulary Headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City, Exhibit â14â, but apparently the constabulary authorities did not give any credence to his defense because he was discharged from the military service effective November 30, 1989, not even giving him the chance to present his evidence. In other words, it was a summary dismissal a procedure resorted to by the military when there is no more need to investigate the case further because of the notoriety of the occurrence giving rise to the controversy and that whatever defense may be proffered by the respondent cannot overcome the preponderance of evidence on record against him. This is what happened in this case and the regularity of the performance of duty and functions by government officials is presumed. No evidence was ever offered by the accused to overcome it.
[56]
The Crime Committed by the Appellant
We agree with the trial court and the CA that under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the appellant is guilty of murder qualified by treachery. The crime was committed before the effectivity of Republic Act No. 7659; hence, the crime was punishable by 
reclusion temporal 
in its maximum period to death under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. Further, under Republic Act No. 8294 amending Presidential Decree No. 1866, the use of an unlicensed firearm to commit homicide or murder is a special aggravating circumstance in the commission of the crime. The Information merely alleged that the appellant used a firearm to kill the victim. It did not allege that the same was unlicensed. Neither was it proved by the prosecution that the appellant had no license to possess the firearm. The appellantâs lack of license to possess the firearm is an essential element of the circumstance.
[57]
 Unless it is alleged in the Information and proved by the prosecution, the use by the appellant of an unlicensed firearm to commit murder is not aggravating. Besides, the crime was committed before the effectivity of the Revised Rules of Court and Rep. Act No. 8294. Hence, the aggravating circumstance should not be appreciated against the appellant.
[58]
There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstance attendant to the crime, the medium period of the penalty imposed by the law for the crime, namely, reclusion perpetua, shall be imposed on the appellant.
[59]
 In this case, the CA correctly imposed the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.
On the civil liability of the appellant, he should be ordered to pay exemplary damages to the heirs of the victim conformably to current jurisprudence.
[60]
IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING
, the appeal is 
DISMISSED
. The Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated February 27, 1998, is 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION
. The appellant is hereby ordered to pay P25,000.00 to the heirs of the victim Loreto Apolinar, as exemplary damages.
