CHICO-NAZARIO, J.:


Before Us is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 with prayer for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Mandatory Injunction, assailing the 26 February 2004 Decision
[1]
 and the 30 June 2004 Resolution
[2]
 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 72570, which affirmed the 15 February 2002
[3]
 and 17 June 2002
[4]
 Orders of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 143, Makati City, in Criminal Case No. 01-2709-10, allowing the amendment of the informations therein from NO BAIL RECOMMENDED to BAIL SET AT P60,000.00.
The facts, as culled from the evidence on record, follow:
Petitioner Vicente S. Cenzon is a member of the Board of Directors of Honig Sugar Trading Corp. (Honig).  On the other hand, private respondent Margarita C. Sia is the president of South Pacific Sugar Corp. (South Pacific).
On 23 February 2000, petitioner Cenzon filed with the Makati City Prosecution Office, four complaint-affidavits
[5]
 against private respondent Sia for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 and Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, alleging that the checks issued by South Pacific, through private respondent Sia, were dishonored upon due presentment for having been the subject of a "stop payment order" (SPO), and for having been "drawn against insufficient funds" (DAIF).  Despite demands made upon private respondent Sia and South Pacific to pay the amounts represented by the face value of the subject checks, the same remained unheeded.
The particulars of the subject checks are, to wit:
CHECK NO.

On 31 August 2000, the Makati City Prosecution Office issued a Resolution
[6]
 recommending the dismissal of the complaint for Estafa, and the filing of informations for four counts of violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, and further recommending bail of P30,000.00 for each count.
On appeal by petitioner Cenzon to the Department of Justice (DOJ),  Resolution
[7]
 dated 31 August 2001 was issued, reversing and setting aside the Resolution dated 31 August 2000, and directing the Makati City Prosecution Office to file two informations for Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d)
[8]
 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818,
[9]
 against private respondent Sia.  In accordance therewith, Makati City Prosecutor Edgardo Hirang filed on 10 December 2001 with the RTC, two informations
[10]
 against private respondent Sia for violations of Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818.  The two informations involved Check No. HRR 0005306682 and Check No. HRR 0005306774, which covered the amounts of P15,840,000.00 and P91,776,970.00, respectively.  The City Prosecutor recommended NO BAIL.  The cases were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 01-2709 and 2710, and subsequently consolidated as Criminal Case No. 01-2709-2710.
On 11 December 2001, the RTC issued an Order
[11]
 directing the issuance of a warrant of arrest against private respondent Sia.  On 29 January 2002, the RTC suspended the proceedings 
a quo
 for the reason that private respondent Sia had a pending Motion for Reconsideration with the DOJ Secretary, questioning the latter's finding of probable cause.  Subsequently, in the hearing of 15 February 2002, the public prosecutor moved for the amendment of the informations from NO BAIL RECOMMENDED to BAIL SET AT P60,000.00 for each count of Estafa.  The amendment was sought on the strength of DOJ Department Circular No. 74, issued on 6 November 2001, which specified the amount of bail to be recommended, in cases of Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d), as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818.  The RTC granted the public prosecutor's Motion, as contained in the assailed Order
[12]
 of 15 February 2002.
Private prosecutor's Motion for Reconsideration of the 15 February 2002 Order was denied by the RTC, in the Order
[13]
 dated 17 June 2002.  Aggrieved, petitioner Cenzon filed with the Court of Appeals, a Petition for 
Certiorari
, imputing to the RTC, grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in authorizing the amendment of the informations to allow private respondent Sia to post bail.
In the assailed Decision of 26 February 2004, the Court of Appeals  affirmed the RTC, ratiocinating that the offense by which private respondent Sia is charged is not punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
, and as such, she is entitled to bail.  The appellate court, relying on the pronouncements in 
People v. Hernando
[14]
 and 
People v. Panganiban
,
[15]
 ratiocinated in the following manner:
Based on the foregoing, it is clear that all persons are entitled to bail, as a matter of right, provided that one is not charged with an offense punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment. In the case at bench, We agree with the private respondent, and concurred in by no less than the Solicitor General, that the offense by which she is being charged is not punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
 and so she is entitled to bail.  Thus, the respondent judge is not guilty of grave abuse of discretion in allowing the amendment of the informations to allow accused-respondent Sia to post bail.
This was clearly illustrated in the leading case of 
People vs. Hernando
 and reiterated in 
People vs. Panganiban
, where it was clarified that 
reclusion perpetua
 is not the prescribed penalty for the offense as used in PD No. 818, to wit:
"xxx    xxx    xxx
"Hence, if the amount of the fraud exceeds twenty-two thousand pesos, the penalty of 
reclusion temporal
 is imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional ten thousand (P10,000.00) pesos but the total penalty shall not exceed thirty (30) years, which shall be termed 
reclusion perpetua
. As used herein, 
RECLUSION PERPETUA
 IS NOT THE PRESCRIBED PENALTY FOR THE OFFENSE. It merely describes the penalty actually imposed on account of the amount of the fraud involved, which exceeds twenty two thousand (P22,000.00) pesos." (Emphasis Ours.)
Precisely, this is the reason why DOJ Circular No. 74 came into effect, to guide all prosecutors in recommending the amount of bail to be fixed. Public Prosecutor Marcos thus correctly moved for the amendment of the informations, and the respondent judge judiciously allowed it to conform with the DOJ circular brought about by the new jurisprudence on the matter. Clearly, the ruling in People vs. Reyes cited by the petitioner is deemed superseded.
Moreover, as cited by the petitioner himself, courts are advised that they must not only be aware but should consider the Bail Bond Guide due to its significance in the administration of criminal justice. Settled also is the rule that, while not controlling, official opinions of the justice secretary are persuasive.
[16]
In the same vein, petitioner Cenzon's Motion for Reconsideration thereon was denied by the appellate court for lack of merit, in the Resolution dated 30 June 2004.
Elevating the matter before this Court 
via
 the instant Petition for Review, petitioner Cenzon submits the following grounds for its allowance, 
viz
:
I
THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE THAT "NO DOCTRINE OR PRINCIPLE OF LAW LAID DOWN BY THE COURT IN A DECISION RENDERED 
EN BANC
 OR IN DIVISION MAY BE MODIFIED OR REVERSED EXCEPT BY THE COURT SITTING 
EN BANC
."
II
THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE BY SOLELY RELYING ON THE CASES OF 
PEOPLE V. HERNANDO
 AND 
PEOPLE V. PANGANIBAN 
WHICH INVOLVE FACTS DIFFERENT FROM THE PRESENT CASE.
[17]
Petitioner Cenzon endeavors to build his case by invoking 
People v. Reyes
,
[18]
 and the 2000 Bail Bond Guide of the DOJ.  According to petitioner Cenzon, the 2000 Bail Bond Guide of the DOJ recommends NO BAIL for Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818, if the amount of the fraud is P32,000.00 or over.  It is petitioner Cenzon's theory that NO BAIL is recommended in such cases, because the penalty prescribed therein is 
reclusion perpetua
.
[19]
  Petitioner Cenzon posits that the 2000 Bail Bond Guide of the DOJ was made pursuant to Section 13,
[20]
 Article III of the 1987 Constitution, which provides that crimes punishable by 
reclusion perpetua 
to death, when evidence of guilt is strong, are not bailable.
Further, petitioner Cenzon asseverates that in 
Reyes,
 the Court 
En Banc 
declared that Presidential Decree No. 818, which took effect as early as 1975, provided for the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua 
where bouncing checks of the requisite amount are involved.
[21]
  Proceeding therefrom, it is petitioner Cenzon's contention that, in the assailed Decision of 26 February 2004, the Court of Appeals erroneously relied on DOJ Department Circular No. 74,
[22]
 which disregards the rule that Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818, where the amount of the fraud is P32,000.00 or above is non-bailable.
Finally, petitioner Cenzon maintains that the ruling in 
Reyes
 which was rendered 
En Banc
 cannot be declared superseded by the subsequent cases of 
Hernando
 and 
Panganiban
, as the latter cases were rendered by divisions of this Court.  Citing Section 4(3),
[23]
 Article VIII of the Constitution, petitioner Cenzon argues that 
Hernando 
and 
Panganiban 
cannot overturn 
Reyes 
because no doctrine or principle of law laid down by the Court in a decision rendered 
En Banc 
or in division may be modified or reversed except by the Court sitting 
En Banc
.
The issue presented for our consideration is, whether private respondent Sia, who is charged with Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d)
[24]
 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818, for having issued bouncing checks in the amounts of P91,776,970.00 and P15,840,000.00, may be granted bail, as a matter of right, in accordance with DOJ Department Circular No. 74, dated 6 November 2001.
At the outset, attention must be called to Section 4, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides:
SEC. 4. 
Bail, a matter of right; exception. â 
 All persons in custody shall be admitted to bail as a matter of right, with sufficient sureties, or released on recognizance as prescribed by law or this Rule (a) before or after conviction by the Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, or Municipal Circuit Trial Court, and (b) before conviction by the Regional Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, 
reclusion perpetua
, or life imprisonment.
Thus, it must be asked, is private respondent Sia charged with an offense punishable by 
reclusion perpetua
?
The issue that confronts us is not novel.  Perforce, in 
Panganiban
, we settled that the term, 
reclusion perpetua
, as utilized in Presidential Decree No. 818, merely 
describes 
the penalty imposed on account of the amount of the fraud involved.  The unequivocal import in Presidential Decree No. 818
[25]
 is that, if the amount of the fraud exceeds twenty-two thousand pesos (P22,000.00), the penalty of 
reclusion temporal 
is imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional ten thousand (P10,000.00) pesos, but the total penalty shall not exceed thirty (30) years, which shall be termed 
reclusion perpetua
.  Taking our legal bearings from the 
Panganiban 
case, we stress that the use of the term 
reclusion perpetua 
in Presidential Decree No. 818 is merely to 
describe 
the penalty imposed, but not the 
prescribed 
penalty thereof.
To reiterate, we quote hereunder, our pronouncement in 
Panganiban
:
Finally, some clarifications on the imposable penalty.  The trial court convicted accused-appellant to 
reclusion perpetua
, following the amendment to Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code by Presidential Decree No. 818, which increased the penalty for estafa committed by means of bouncing checks.
Presidential Decree No. 818 provides:
SECTION 1. Any person who shall defraud another by means of false pretenses  or fraudulent acts as defined in paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 4885, shall be punished by:
1
st
.  The penalty of 
reclusion temporal
 if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos, and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional 10,000 pesos but the total penalty which may be imposed shall in no case exceed thirty years.  In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed under the Revised Penal Code, the penalty shall be termed 
reclusion perpetua
;
x x x x
As used in Presidential Decree No. 818, 
reclusion perpetua
 is not the prescribed penalty for the offense, but merely describes the penalty actually imposed on account of the amount of the fraud involved, which exceeds P22,000.00
.
[26]
 (Underscoring supplied.)
The Court, in 
Hernando
 was just as succinct in pronouncing that the term 
reclusion perpetua 
as used in Presidential Decree No. 818, merely describes the penalty actually imposed on account of the amount of the fraud involved, which exceeds twenty two thousand (P22,000.00) pesos.
[27]
  As used in Presidential Decree No. 818, 
reclusion perpetua 
is not the prescribed penalty for the offense.
[28]
Moreover, the Court, thru an 
En Banc 
Resolution, dated 26 February 2002, in 
Jovencio Lim and Teresita Lim v. People
,
[29]
 pronounced that bail is allowed for the crime of Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d), as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818.
[30]
  Petitioners therein were charged with the offense of Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818, for having issued two postdated checks involving the amounts of P365,750.00 and P429,000.00.  We allowed aforesaid petitioners to post bail in accordance with the provisions of DOJ Circular No. 74, dated 6 November 2001.
In 
Lim
, we said that the intendment and provision of DOJ Circular No. 74 was to benefit the accused.  Indeed, it is a principle of statutory construction that penal laws are liberally construed in favor of the accused and strictly against the State.
[31]
  In like manner, we must also apply DOJ Circular No. 74 to herein private respondent Sia.
We find inapplicable the case of 
Reyes
.  In 
Reyes
, the question was whether therein accused who was 
convicted
, 
inter alia
, of Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code and  sentenced therefore to serve twenty-two years of 
reclusion perpetua
, with its accessory penalties and liability for indemnification, may be allowed to remain on bail during the pendency of her appeal from said conviction.
[32]
  Comparatively, what is before us is an accused 
charged
 with Estafa under paragraph 2(d), Article 316 of the Revised Penal Code.  Clearly, 
Reyes 
is not on all fours with the case at bar.  Instead, it is the later case of 
Lim 
which finds application.
Our Resolution in 
Lim
, dated 26 February 2002, and issued by the Court 
En Banc 
settled the issue anent the allowance of bail in cases involving Estafa under paragraph 2(d), Article 316 of the Revised Penal Code.  As earlier stated, in 
Lim
, we allowed the accused therein to post bail, and we upheld DOJ Department Circular No. 74, citing 
Hernando
.  In the more recent case of 
Poblete v. Court of Appeals
,
[33]
 the Court underscored once more with definitive pronouncement the application of DOJ Department Circular No. 74 in cases involving the crime of Estafa under Art. 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818.  
Stare decisis et non quieta movera
.
We said in 
Poblete
, thus:
It was definitively resolved when the Court adopted Department of Justice (DOJ) Circular No. 74 ordaining that bail be allowed for the crime of Estafa under Art. 315, par. 2(d), as amended by P.D. 818, thru an En Banc Resolution dated February 26, 2002 in the case of 
Jovencio Lim and Teresita Lim v. People of the Philippines, et al
., G.R. No. 149276. The salient portion of the Resolution reads:
"(3)      Where the amount of fraud is P32,000.00 or over in which the imposable penalty is 
reclusion temporal 
to 
reclusion perpetua
, bail shall be based on reclusion temporal maximum, pursuant to Par. 2(a) of the 2000 Bail Bond Guide, multiplied by P2,000.00 plus an additional of P2,000.00 for every P10,000.00 in excess of P22,000.00; Provided, however, that the total amount of bail shall not exceed P60,000.00."
[34]
We are similarly not impressed with petitioner Cenzon's reliance on the 2000 Bail Bond Guide of the DOJ.  Evidently, Department Circular No. 74 of the DOJ amended the 2000 Bail Bond Guide, the salient provisions thereof, reads thus:
WHEREAS, under the 2000 Bail Bond Guide, no bail is recommended for estafa under Art. 315 2(d), RPC, as amended by PD 818, as well as for Qualified Theft when the amount of fraud or the value of the property involved is P32,000.00 or over;
WHEREAS, such policy has already been overtaken and rendered untenable by the new jurisprudence, particularly the ruling in People vs. Hernando, 317 SCRA 621 (1999);
WHEREFORE, in estafa under Art. 315 2(d), as amended by PD 818, and Qualified Theft, the bail to be recommended shall be governed by the following rules:
A.     
FOR ESTAFA (ART. 315, 2(d), RPC, as amended by PD 818: 
                                                            
1)
Where the amount of fraud involved does not exceed P22,000.00, bail shall be computed based on the applicable provisions of the 2000 Bail Bond Guide.
 
2) 
Where the amount of fraud involved is more than P22,000.00 but less than P32,000.00, bail shall be based on the maximum period of the imposable penalty of reclusion temporal multiplied by P2,000.00.
 
3)
Where the amount of fraud is P32,000.00 or over in which the imposable penalty is reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua, bail shall be based on reclusion temporal maximum, pursuant to Par. 2(a) of the 2000 Bail Bond Guide, multiplied by P2,000.00, plus an additional of P2,000.00 for every P10,000.00 in excess of P22,000.00; Provided, however, that the total amount of bail shall not exceed P60,000.00.  (Underscoring supplied.)
From the foregoing, if the amount of fraud is P122,000.00 or over, as in the case at bar, the amount of bail is P60,000.00.
WHEREFORE
, the petition is hereby 
DENIED
.  The Decision dated 26 February 2004 and Resolution dated 30 June 2004 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 72570, which affirmed the Orders dated 15 February 2002 and 17 June 2002 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 143, Makati City, allowing the amendment of the informations in Crim. Case No. 01-2709-10, from NO BAIL RECOMMENDED to BAIL SET AT P60,000.00 are AFFIRMED.  Costs against petitioner.
