PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. NINOY ROSALES Y ESTO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

PEREZ, J.:


This Appeal seeks the reversal and setting aside of the Decision
[1]
 dated 26 July 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 03043, which affirmed the Decision
[2]
 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan City, Branch 129 convicting appellant Ninoy Rosales y Esto of the crime of rape.
Appellant was charged with rape in an Information,
[3]
 the accusatory portion of which reads as follows:
That on or about the 27
th
 day of June, 2004, in Caloocan City, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, having knowledge that [AAA],
[4]
 39 years old, is mentally retarded and has the mind of child below 18 years old, taking advantage of the victimâs mental disability, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously had sexual intercourse with said [AAA].
Appellant pleaded not guilty on arraignment.  Trial on the merits ensued.
The victim, AAA, then 39 years of age, testified that in the morning of 27 June 2004, while she was holding a dog outside her residence in X X X,
[5]
 Quezon City, appellant approached her and gave her P200.00 to buy some junk food.  Appellant then forced her to go with him to his house located inside a nearby cemetery in Caloocan City.  Upon reaching appellantâs house, appellant ordered AAA to lie down.  He undressed her, sucked her nipple and inserted his penis in her vagina.  AAA felt pain.  Thereafter, appellant ordered her to put her dress on and took her cellular phone.  Appellant sold AAAâs phone and bought drinks for his drinking companions.  AAA was later fetched by her sister at appellantâs house.  AAA identified appellant in court as the person who raped her.
[6]
On 28 June 2004, BBB
[7]
 accompanied her daughter AAA to the Women and Children Protection Desk of the Caloocan City Police Station to report the incident.
The police investigator immediately prepared a request so that AAA could be physically examined by a medico-legal.
[8]
 After the medical examination, Medico-Legal Report No. M-366-04 was issued by Dr. Filemon C. Porciuncula, Jr.  The Report contains the following pertinent findings and conclusion:
GENITAL:
PUBIC HAIR: Abundant
LABIA MAJORA: Full, convex & coapted
LABIA MINORA: With dark brown, hypertrophied. Labia minora congested & abraded on both sides.
HYMEN: Deep healed lacerations at 3&7 oâclock position.
POSTERIOR FOURCHETTE: Abraded, congested
EXTERNAL VAGINAL ORIFICE: Slight resistance of the examining index finger.
VAGINAL CANAL: Narrow with prominent rugosities.
CERVIX: Firm & closed.
PERIURETHRAL AND VAGINAL SMEARS: Negative for spermatozoa & negative for gram negative diplococci.
CONCLUSION: Subject is non-virgin state physically.  There are no external signs of application of any form of trauma.
[9]
Dr. Lorenda Gozar (Dr. Gozar), a clerical psychologist working with the National Bureau of Investigaton, testified on AAAâs mental condition.  Dr. Gozar had examined AAA and concluded in her Neuro-Psychiatric Examination and Evaluation that AAA has been found suffering from âmoderate mental retardation with a Mental Age of (6) six years and (8) eight months and an IQ of (41) forty-one.â 
[10]
Appellant, testifying in his own behalf, denied that he raped AAA.  He however admitted that he was having a drinking session in his house with AAA when the alleged rape incident occurred.  Appellant stated that prior to the incident, AAA has lived in his house for 4 months.  He then denied any knowledge of AAAâs mental condition.
[11]
On 19 September 2007, the RTC rendered judgment finding appellant guilty of rape and imposing the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.  The RTC also ordered appellant to pay P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages.
[12]
The  trial  court  found AAAâs testimony straightforward, notwithstanding her mental condition.  The trial court also dismissed appellantâs alibi as weak and unreliable.
On 26 September 2007, appellant filed a notice of appeal.
[13]
On 26 July 2010, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court.  Consequently, appellant filed a notice of appeal.
[14]
On 10 August 2011, this Court informed the parties that it had received the records from the Court of Appeals and required them to file their respective supplemental briefs.
[15]
 Both parties manifested that they would no longer file supplemental briefs, since they had exhaustively argued all the relevant issues in the Briefs they had previously submitted before the Court of Appeals.
[16]
The case is now before us.  Appellant assigned two (2) errors in his appeal which were initially passed upon by the Court of Appeals, to wit: 1) whether the trial court gravely erred in considering the evidence adduced by the prosecution despite its apparent incredibility; and 2) whether the trial court gravely erred in rendering a verdict of conviction despite the fact that the guilt of the accused-appellant was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.
[17]
Appellant contends that AAAâs testimony is incredible on the lone argument that the latter did not make an outcry when the alleged lustful advances were made against her.
In 
People v. Alipio
,
[18]
 the Court rebuked appellant therein for raising a similar argument.  The Court went on to state that it is not fair to judge a mentally-retarded person, one who does not have a good grasp of information and who lacks the capacity to make a mental calculation of the events unfolding before her eyes, according to what is natural or unnatural for normal persons.
[19]
In this case where the victim was proven to be a mental retardate, it could certainly not be expected that AAA would have behaved or acted in accordance with what appellant perceived to be as normal.
At any rate, it is an oft-repeated principle that not every witness to or victim of a crime can be expected to act reasonably and conformably to the usual expectations of everyone.  People may react differently to the same situation.  One person's spontaneous, or unthinking or even instinctive, response to a horrible and repulsive stimulus may be aggression, while another's may be cold indifference.  Yet, it can never be successfully argued that the latter are any less sexual victims than the former.
[20]
Moreover, when AAA was called to the witness stand, she never wavered in her assertion that appellant raped her. AAAâs testimony is clear and concise, thus:

Q:

A: 
 
Siya po
 [s]ir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interpreter: The witness pointed to a person who responded by the name of Ninoy Rosales your Honor.
[22]
 
 
The fact of AAAâs mental retardation did not impair the credibility of her testimony.  Mental retardation 
per se 
does not affect credibility.  A one mentally retarded may be a credible witness.  The acceptance of her testimony depends on the quality of her perceptions and the manner she can make them known to the court.
[23]
We have thoroughly examined AAAâs testimony and found no reason to depart from the legal adage that this Court accords the trial judgeâs assessment of the credibility of witnesses great respect in the absence of any attendant of grave abuse of discretion on the account that the trial court had the advantage of actually examining both real and testimonial pieces of evidence, including the demeanor of the witnesses, and is in the best position to rule on the matter.  The rule finds an even greater application when the trial courtâs findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals.
[24]
Taking into consideration the positive and categorical declaration of AAA and the medical findings to support her claims, we affirm the lower courtsâ unanimous finding that AAA , by proof beyond reasonable doubt, was raped by the appellant.
Appellantâs denials and alibi cannot prevail over the positive, consistent and straightforward testimony of AAA.  Alibi is an inherently weak defense because it is easy to fabricate and highly unreliable.  To merit approbation, the accused must adduce clear and convincing evidence that he was in a place other than the 
situs criminis 
at the time the crime was committed, such that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime when it was committed.
[25]
  Appellant admitted that he was in fact with AAA at his house when the rape incident occurred.  Considering that he was at the place where the crime was committed, his alibi cannot be given any weight or value.
The lower courts, in vague terms, found appellant guilty of rape and imposed the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua.
  It is very clear from the Information that the allegations therein actually constitute a criminal charge for qualified rape under Article 266-A, paragraph (1)(a), in relation to Section 266-B, paragraph (10) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, which provide:
ART. 266-A.  Rape; When and How Committed. â  Rape is committed:
1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
a) Through force, threat or intimidation;
b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;
c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;
d)  When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age  or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
x x x x
ART. 266-B. Penalties. â Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua.
x x x x
The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:
x x x x
10) When the offender knew of the mental disability, emotional disorder and/or physical handicap of the offended party at the time of the commission of the crime.
Under the aforementioned provisions, when rape is committed by an assailant who has knowledge of the victimâs mental retardation, the penalty is increased to death.  This circumstance must be alleged in the information being a qualifying circumstance which increases the penalty to death and changes the nature of the offense from simple to qualified rape.
[26]
Although appellant denied any knowledge about AAAâs mental condition, it was he himself who volunteered the information that he had been living with AAA for four (4) months in his house.  It is therefore logical to assume that appellant was fully aware of the workings of AAAâs mental faculties.  Furthermore, AAAâs mental condition was sufficiently established by medical findings, as well as the testimony of AAAâs mother.
Considering the presence of the special qualifying circumstance of the appellant's knowledge of the victim's mental retardation, the same being properly alleged in the Information charging the appellant of the crime of rape and proven during trial, this Court imposes on the appellant the supreme penalty of death.  But with the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346,
[27]
 the imposition of the death penalty has been prohibited.  This Court accordingly imposes the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 without eligibility for parole.
The significance of raising the crime charged from simple rape to qualified rape relates to the award of damages.  Since the crime of rape is perpetrated with a qualifying circumstance which required the imposition of the death penalty, the civil indemnity and moral damages for the victim shall be increased to P75,000.00 each.
[28]
  Also, the award of exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00 is in order.
[29]
WHEREFORE

DENIED
.  The Decision dated 26 July 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 03043 is
