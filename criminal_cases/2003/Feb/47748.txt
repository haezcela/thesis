[ G.R. Nos. 141438-40, February 03, 2003 ]


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. LITO LIMPANGOG AND JERRY LIMPANGOG, APPELLANTS.
DECISION




PANGANIBAN, J.:


In every criminal prosecution, the State must prove beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime charged 
and
 the complicity or participation of the accused. Where the evidence does not show beyond moral certainty that appellant was one of the perpetrators of the offense, acquittal necessarily follows. The constitutional presumption of innocence must be upheld.

 The Facts
Version of the Prosecution
In its Additional Brief for the Appellee,
[10]
 the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the prosecutionâs version of the facts in this wise:
 âPedro Casimero testified that he was the driver of a Yamaha motorcab owned by Marilyn Barte, plying Cogon, Owak and Isabel, Leyte. On November 19, 1993, about 8:00 oâclock in the evening, while waiting for passengers at the Ormoc City terminal, appellants Lito and Jerry Limpangog approached him and told him that they wanted to hire his motorcab for P150.00 in going to Isabel, Leyte. Pedro refused and told appellants that they could hire his motorcab for P250.00. Pedro then told appellants that another passenger who turned out to be Jose Cabanero was also going to Isabel, Leyte and could pay the difference.
âWhile appellants were eating at a well-lighted restaurant, Pedro Casimero noticed that appellant Lito Limpangog had a tattoo on the left hand. Thereafter, appellants took the motorcab of Pedro going to Isabel, Leyte with Jose Cabanero sitting inside the motocab. As Jerry Limpangog was getting into the motorcab, someone called for Lito Limpangog and someone answered that he was urinating. They passed Barangay Puertobello, Merida, Leyte in order to fetch Pedroâs cousin, Ren[y] Boy Casimero. Reny Boy sat in the front portion of the motorcab.
âWhile they were negotiating the Highway of Merida, Leyte, appellant Lito Limpangog ordered Pedro to stop the motorcab as he wanted to urinate. Pedro was hesitant because it was a dark and secluded place. When Pedro turned his head to look behind, he saw appellant Lito Limpangog about to stab him with a hunting knife. Pedro was stabbed on the left and right scapular area. Pedro jumped off the still running motorcab and at the same time shouted at Reny Boy to tell him to jump off the motorcab. Pedro saw Reny Boy jump from the motorcab and stagger as he landed on the ground. With Jose Cabanero still inside the motorcab, Pedro and Reny Boy ran as fast as they could in order to ask for assistance from the police. Reny Boy and Pedro was able to ask for assistance at a nearby house and while inside the house, Pedro saw his motorcab pass by. Afterwards, Pedro and Reny Boy went to the PNP Headquarters at Merida, Leyte to report the incident.
âReny Boy Casimero narrated that while trying to escape, appellants stabbed him on the armpit, right thigh and back. Later, he and Pedro were taken by the police to the Ormoc District Hospital, Leyte, for treatment.
âPO2 Noel Igot of the PNP, Merida testified that in the evening of November 19, 1993, a barangay tanod and Pedro Casimero reported the carnapping of Pedroâs motorcab and the stabbing incident at Merida, Leyte. Igot brought Pedro for treatment to the Ormoc District Hospital at Merida, Leyte where he was joined by Reny Boy, who was also wounded in the incident. The following day, November 20, 1993, a civilian reported that a dead person was found on the creek at the Municipal Highway of Merida, Leyte. The police responded and found the dead body of Jose Cabanero.
âThe Certification dated November 19, 1993 issued by Celso S. Antiligando, Chief of Police, PNP, Isabel, Leyte, relative to the incident, reads:

Version of the Defense
In their Additional Brief,
[12]
 appellants deny the charges and give their version of the facts thus:
 âLito Limpangog testified that on November 7, 1993 at around 7:00 oâclock in the evening, he was in his house when policemen arrived and invited him to the police station of Matag-ob, Leyte. He was invited together with his cousin Jerry Limpangog. They were detained at the police station because they were suspects in the stabbing incident at Matag-ob, Leyte. He requested the PNP of Matag-ob, Leyte to contact the PNP of Merida, Leyte. When the policemen of Merida arrived, Pedro Casimero was made to identify them. Pedro Casimero was asked by the police officer of Matag-ob whether or not the two (2) of them were his passengers on the night the stabbing incident happened. They were ordered to come out of the prison cell and Pedro Casimero was made to identify them. Pedro Casimero held his arms and ordered him to turn his back. The room was lighted with a flourescent lamp. Pedro Casimero told the policemen of Merida: âThese are not the persons because I can clearly identify that person who stabbed me.â After Pedro Casimero made his remarks, the policemen of Merida left x x x[.] The [two] were released at 7:00 oâclock the following morning.
âJerry Limpangog testified that on December 7, 1993 at around 7:00 oâclock in the evening, he was in the house of Lito Limpangog when policemen arrived and invited them to the police station of Matag-ob, Leyte. They were investigated at the police station. Pedro Casimero together with policemen from Merida, Leyte were present during the investigation. Pedro Casimero failed to identify them as his assailants. Pedro told everybody that he knew his assailants. Pedro held his hand to find out if there was any tattoo, but he found nothing. After Pedro told the police that they were not his assailants, they were released. He further testified that on November 19, 1993 at 7:00 oâclock in the evening he was at the bakery where he worked as a baker. He denied having gone to Ormoc City on November 19, 1993.
âRonaldo Canete, an inmate of the Leyte Sub-Provincial jail claimed that Lito Limpangog was detained at the Leyte Sub- Provincial Jail. During Litoâs detention, he approached him and asked him to place tattoo markings on his body. He acceded to the request of Lito and made tattoo markings on the latterâs right hand. The design of the tattoo on right shoulder of Lito was that of a man, while that on the right hand is letter âSâ.â
[13]
 (Citations omitted)
Ruling of the Trial Court
The RTC ruled that appellants had been sufficiently identified as the perpetrators of the felonies described in the Informations. It gave credence to the testimony of Pedro Casimero that he had seen the faces of the perpetrators when they negotiated for a motorcab ride to Isabel and ate in a restaurant. The fact that, when he testified, Lito Limpangog was sporting an alleged identifying mark -- a tattoo on his left hand -- further convinced the lower court that he was indeed one of the malefactors.
The trial court also appreciated the aggravating circumstance of nighttime.
Hence, this appeal.
[14]
Incidentally, in a letter
[15]
 dated August 21, 2000, Penal Superintendent I Miguel R. Serrano of the Leyte Regional Prison informed this Court that Appellant Jerry Limpangog had died on January 17, 1996, while in detention.
The consequences of an appellantâs death are provided for in Article 89 (1) of the Revised Penal Code, which reads as follows:
 âArt. 89. 
How criminal liability is totally extinguished.
 â Criminal liability is totally extinguished:
By the death of the convict, as to the personal penalties; and as to pecuniary penalties, liability therefor is extinguished only when the death of the offender occurs before final judgment.â
Applying the above to Jerry Limpangog, the Court holds that his death extinguished his criminal and concomitant civil liabilities. Accordingly, the criminal cases against him should be dismissed.
Consequently, only Lito Limpangogâs appeal is the subject of this Decision.
Issues
Appellant Lito Limpangog raises the following issues for this Courtâs consideration:
 
âI
The trial court gravely erred in giving full weight and credence to the inconsistent and unbelievable testimony of Private Complainant Pedro Casimero and in completely disregarding the defense interposed by the accused-appellants.
âII
The trial court gravely erred in finding the accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of murder and two (2) counts of frustrated murder despite insufficiency of the evidence for the prosecution.
âIII
The trial court gravely erred in appreciating nighttime as an aggravating circumstance despite failure of the prosecution to show that it was purposely sought to facilitate the commission of the crimes charged on the assumption that accused-appellants are really guilty.
âIV
The trial court gravely erred in convicting accused-appellants of the crime of murder despite failure of the prosecution to prove the presence of any of the qualifying circumstance in the commission of the crimes charged.â
[16]
âV
The trial court gravely erred in convicting accused-appellants despite failure of the prosecution to establish beyond reasonable [doubt] the identities of the perpetrators of the crimes charged.â
[17]
 
 In sum, the issues in this case boil down to three: (1) whether the identities of the perpetrators were sufficiently established, (2) whether qualifying circumstances were sufficiently established, and (3) whether the aggravating circumstance of nighttime was correctly appreciated.
The Courtâs Ruling
The appeal is meritorious. Appellant must be acquitted.
Main Issue:
The Identities of the Perpetrators
Lito Limpangog does not dispute that the death of Jose Cabanero and the injuries sustained by Pedro Casimero and Reny Boy Casimero were the consequences of crimes perpetrated on the night of November 19, 1993.
Appellant contends, however, that he did not participate in any manner in the commission of those crimes. He questions the credibility of Pedro and Reny Boy, whose testimonies were offered by the prosecution to prove that he was indeed one of the malefactors.
As a general rule, the trial courtâs evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses is accorded with the highest degree of respect on appeal. It is not to be disturbed in the absence of a clear showing that the lower court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied any fact or circumstance of weight or substance that could alter the result of the case.
[18]
 In the present case, however, the scant facts on record compel the reversal of the trial courtâs findings.
Pedro Casimero testified that the men who hired his motorcab on the night of November 19, 1993 were the perpetrators of the crimes. He also said that he had never seen them before. In fact, he neither gave
[19] 
 nor was asked to give
[20]
 a description of any one of them, when he reported the incident to the PNP headquarters at Merida, Leyte.
The records show that apart from the Report
[21]
 of the recovery of a tricycle abandoned at OsmeÃ±a Street, Poblacion, Isabel, Leyte, no further investigation of the crimes was conducted by the police.
On December 7, 1993, almost three weeks after the incident, Pedro Casimero was called to the police station to identify the suspects. (Appellant Lito Limpangog was then in custody for allegedly causing trouble in a dance hall in Matag-ob, Leyte.
[22]
) Pedro recounted this incident on cross-examination:
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
In fact, Mr. Casimero, when the suspects were apprehended by the Matag-ob police sometime in the month of December, 1993, you were called upon by the Matag-ob police to come and identify the suspects, is that correct?

Yes, sir.

[23]
 
 
The court 
a quo
 totally disregarded the above testimony of Pedro. Instead, it latched on to his in-court identification of appellant during the formerâs direct testimony on July 5, 1994.
We believe that the RTC committed a grave error. The credibility of the in-court identification made by Pedro on July 5, 1994 -- more than seven months after the incident -- is questionable in the light of his failure to identify Lito and Jerry Limpangog when they were presented to him on December 7, 1993, barely three weeks after the attack; and of his repeated categorical statements that they were not the perpetrators of the crimes. Though he claimed to have remembered the faces of the malefactors, the records reveal that his sole clue to their identities was the tattoo mark on the left hand of the man who stabbed him on November 19, 1993.
It follows that that attacker could not have been Appellant Lito, who acquired his tattoo only in 1994.
[24]
 The absence of a tattoo on the left hand of either Lito or Jerry Limpangog when the two were presented to Pedro on December 7, 1993 is consistent with the explanation of Lito that he had the tattoo done on his left hand only after he had been arrested and detained for the present case.
In 
People v. Teehankee Jr.
[25]
 the Court explained that âwhile eyewitness identification is significant, it is not as accurate and authoritative as the scientific forms of identification evidence such as the fingerprint or the DNA test result. Some authors even describe eyewitness evidence as âinherently suspect.ââ
[26]
 Known causes of misidentification have been identified as follows:
 âIdentification testimony has at least three components. First, witnessing a crime, whether as a victim or a bystander, involves perception of an event actually occurring. Second, the witness must memorize details of the event. Third, the witness must be able to recall and communicate accurately. 
Dangers of unreliability in eyewitness testimony arise at each of these three stages, for whenever people attempt to acquire, retain, and retrieve information accurately, they are limited by normal human fallibilities and suggestive influences.
â
[27]
When we take all of the above factors into consideration, the probability that Pedro erred in identifying appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crimes becomes clearer.
We now examine the testimony of Reny Boy positively identifying appellant as one of the assailants. This witness testified that he got a brief glimpse of them on the night of November 19, 1993.
[28]
 They were allegedly the men seated on the motorcycle of the tricycle, whose sidecar he boarded when Pedro picked him up on the way to Isabel.
There is no evidence that shows Reny Boy faithfully took note of, much less accurately memorized, the facial features of the other passengers. In the natural course of events, he could not have done so the very first time he saw them, since nothing particularly interesting was happening then. Furthermore, he could not have seen their faces clearly during the attack, because it was dark and he was in a hurry to get out of the tricycle and escape.
Reny Boy did not give to the police any description of the perpetrators on the night of the incident. Yet in his Affidavit
[29]
 dated January 13, 1994, he claimed to have seen the tattoo on Litoâs left hand. Upon cross-examination, however, he admitted that he did not actually see the tattoo, but was only told about it by his cousin Pedro.
[30]
 Indeed, the records show that the former was present in the courtroom when the latter identified appellant as one of the perpetrators.
The above circumstances fail to persuade us that the in-court identifications made by Reny Boy were based upon his observations of the suspects during the time of the incident, and not upon suggestive influences 
thereafter
. We are not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that he accurately acquired, retained and retrieved sufficient information to have properly identified the assailants.
Aside from the shaky and unreliable identification testimonies of Pedro and Reny Boy, there is no other evidence to prove that appellant was guilty of the crimes charged. Since these testimonies cannot be given weight, the evidence that he was one of the malefactors falls short of the proof beyond reasonable doubt required in criminal cases.
[31]
 Consequently, the constitutional presumption of innocence must be upheld.
[32]
The rationale behind the constitutional presumption of innocence has been explained by the Court in 
People v. Godoy
[33]
 as follows: 
âThe presumption of innocence . . . is founded upon the first principles of justice, and is not a mere form but a substantial part of the law. It is not overcome by mere suspicion or conjecture; a probability that the defendant committed the crime; nor by the fact that he had the opportunity to do so. Its purpose is to balance the scales in what would otherwise be an uneven contest between the lone individual pitted against the People and all the resources at their command. Its inexorable mandate is that, for all the authority and influence of the prosecution, the accused must be acquitted and set free if his guilt cannot be proved beyond the whisper of a doubt. This is in consonance with the rule that conflicts in evidence must be resolved upon the theory of innocence rather than upon a theory of guilt when it is possible to do so.â 
Indeed, the State, aside from showing the existence of a crime, has the burden of correctly identifying the author of the crime. Both requisites must be âproved by the State beyond reasonable doubt on the strength of its evidence and without solace from the weakness of the defense. Thus, even if the defense of the accused may be weak, the same is inconsequential if, in the first place, the prosecution failed to discharge the onus on his identity and culpability. The presumption of innocence dictates that it is for the people to demonstrate guilt and not for the accused to establish innocence.â
