CARPIO MORALES, J.:


Before this Court for automatic review is the Decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court of Tarlac, Branch 65, in Criminal Case No. 9643 convicting accused-appellant Roderick Legaspi of rape.
The Information dated August 18, 1997 charged accused-appellant as follows:
 
x x x
That on or about the July 3, 1997 at around 8:00 oâclock in the evening, in the Municipality of 
Tarlac
, Province of 
Tarlac
 and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused by means of force and violence did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
have carnal knowledge
 of complainant AAA, 
a child below seven (7) years old.
CONTRARY TO LAW.

[2]
 (Emphasis supplied.)
Accused-appellant was arraigned on October 28, 1997. Duly assisted by his counsel 
de oficio
, he entered a plea of not guilty.
[3]
The following facts are not disputed.
On July 3, 1997, at around 6:00 p.m., accused-appellant, together with his father Rogelio and two others, had a drinking spree at their family house in 
Panumpunan, Tarlac, Tarlac
. At around 8:00 p.m., he asked the more than 6-year old AAA, the niece of his fatherâs common law wife 
Brigida Pagsibagan
, to go out with him for a few minutes. AAA, who was wearing a pair of short pants and a shirt, obliged and the two left the house.
[4]
As two hours had elapsed and accused-appellant and AAA had not yet returned, 
Brigida
 started looking for them. She later went to the barangay hall to report the matter.
[5]
About past 11:00 p.m. also of July 3, 1997, accused-appellant and AAA returned home.
[6]
 AAA, who was silent, with her arms placed âacross her breast,â
[7]
 was already garbed in accused-appellantâs t-shirt, without panty and slippers, and with her head and back full of sand.
[8]
 Accused-appellant on the other hand was only wearing a pair of wet pants.
[9]
 When 
Brigida
 asked them where they came from, AAA replied that they came from the river,
[10]
 about a kilometer away from their house. And when she was asked what accused-appellant did to her, AAA said that he kissed her, boxed the left portion of her stomach, and let her drink dirty water.
[11]
 While AAA did not say that she was sexually abused, given her appearance, 
Brigida
 brought her and accused-appellant, who tried to flee but was overtaken, to the barangay hall.
[12]
At the barangay hall, Kagawad Edilberto Villanueva asked AAA what happened, to which she replied that accused-appellant brought her to the river and âwent on top of her.â
[13]
 Villanueva, 
Brigida
, AAA and accused-appellant thereupon proceeded to the municipal hall to report the matter to the police who directed that AAA be brought to the provincial hospital for examination.
[14]
 AAA was thus immediately brought to the Tarlac Provincial Hospital
[15]
 where she was examined by Dr. Susan Rhea Maniquis.
From Dr. Maniquisâ examination of AAA, the following findings
[16]
 were noted:
 EXT. GENITALIA: absent pubic hair, labia majora completely hiding labia minora, vestibule is erythematous; 
(+) complete laceration 6âoclock position, (+) incomplete laceration, 2â oclock position, (+) abrasion 9-10 âoclock positions
; post-fourchette V-shaped, (-) bleeding, (-) hematomas. (Emphasis supplied)
Hence, the filing of a complaint for rape against accused-appellant at the 
Tarlac, Tarlac
 Municipal Trial Court which conducted a preliminary investigation at which accused-appellant failed to file a Counter-Affidavit.
[17]
 The Provincial Prosecutor accordingly filed the Information against accused-appellant.
Villanueva declared that accused-appellant âadmitted that he was raping AAA but he was not able to insert his penis.â
[18]
When Dr. Maniquis was interrogated on her findings, she gave the following testimony, quoted 
verbatim
:

x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
By this finding of yours âvestibule is erythematousâ, what do you mean by this?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
The  
vestibule I am referring to is that diamond shape area of the perineumwhere the urine comes out
, and 
âerythematousâ I mean the 
reddish
 color in the vestibule.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
And what could have caused that reddish color in the vestibule?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
It could have been caused by an object that could have insinuated into that opening.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
And by your finding âcomplete laceration 6:00 oâclock positionâ, what do you mean, doctor?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
By that, I mean that supposed to be the hymen is intact and there are no lacerations. There are 
angulations
 
along the hymenal wall
. And by 
complete
, I mean that the  
laceration reaches from the surface of the hymen up to the base ofthe hymen
. That is complete. And by incomplete, I mean that it did not reach one-half of the hymen. The depth of the laceration did not reach up to the base of the hymen.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
About the â
abrasion
, 9-10 oâclock position,â what do you mean by that? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
By that I mean that I saw linear abrasion, it was just a scratch mark
.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
And what could have caused those complete laceration 6:00 oâclock position, incomplete laceration, 2:00 oâclock position and abrasion 9-10 oâclock positionsâ?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
Those could have been caused by 
trauma
, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
Would a sexual intercourse cause these injuries or lacerations?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
Possibly, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
And in this case you did not find any sperm cells in the genitalia area. If there was alleged sexual abuse on the patient and found that there were no sperm cells in the said genitalia road, then it may rule out the possibility that he lacerations that you found in the hymen were not made by male organ?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
It is possible that the victim or patient was raped even if there were no spermcells found in the genitalia area
.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
But the finding that there were no sperm cells found in the genitalia area is a deep indication that the lacerations were made or could have been made by blunt instrument?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
Itâs possible.

COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
What could have caused the abrasion, doctor?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
That abrasion that I saw on the vestibule could have been caused by a fingernail or any sharp object.

Q:
 
 
What is the significance of the 6:00 oâclock position . . .
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A:
 
 
I just want to impart that there was trauma to that area.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
Has there been penetration?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
Not necessarily.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
When you say âtraumaâ, 
what could have caused this trauma
?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
 
It may have been caused by any object  
or human finger or penis of a maleorgan.

Accused-appellant insisted that he and AAA just took a bath in the river.
AAA, who refused to testify during the presentation by the prosecution of its evidence in chief, finally took the witness stand on rebuttal. Through her following testimony,
[20]
 the prosecution sought to further prove that she was raped.

Finding for the prosecution, the trial court convicted accused-appellant by the assailed decision, the dispositive portion
[21]
 of which reads:
 âNow therefore, this court finds you, Roderick Legaspi, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the heinous crime of rape pursuant to Article 335 in relation to RA 7610 and RA 7659 in relation to Article 14, Pars. 3, 6, 14 & 15 of the Revised Penal Code and therefore sentences you to die by lethal injection and to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P150,000.00 as consequential, exemplary and moral damages.
MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL.
SO ORERED.
Tarlac City, Dec. 15, 1998.â
In his Brief, accused-appellant assigns to the trial court the following errors, quoted 
verbatim
:
 
I.
THE TRIAL COURT DENIED TO ACCUSED-APPELLANT HIS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL BY THE BIAS IT HAD SHOWN AGAINST HIM AND IN ITS UNDUE HASTE IN CONVICTING HIM OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED IN THE INFORMATION.
II.
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF QUALIFIED RAPE NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
III.
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING THE DEATH PENALTY ON ACCUSED-APPELLANT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PRESENT INDEPENDENT PROOF OF THE ACTUAL AGE OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT TO PROVE HER AGE.
[22]
Accused-appellant cites the promulgation of the judgment on the day following the testimony of AAA as indicative of bias. For, so accused-appellant submits, it is doubtful if the trial court meticulously considered all the evidence presented.
[23]
Accused-appellantâs submission does not convince. A judge has in his favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of his official duty.
[24]
 Mere suspicion or bare allegation that the judge is biased or partial to a party is not enough; there should be adequate evidence to prove the charge.
[25]
 That the judgment was promulgated on the day following the testimony of AAA as rebuttal witness cannot be considered as adequate evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption, especially given the fact that her testimony was simple â that accused-appellant removed her clothes, boxed her, kissed her, went on top of her, touched her private part and held his penis and put it inside her sex organ although it did not enter the âhole.â
Accused-appellant adds that the predisposition of the trial court to convict him was shown by the fact that it asked and allowed the prosecution to ask the victim leading questions without first showing that there was difficulty in getting direct and intelligible answers from her because of tender age.
[26]
It is, however, often expedient or even necessary in the due and faithful administration of justice for the judge, in the exercise of sound discretion, to question a witness in order that his judgment may rest upon a full and clear understanding of the facts, even if the testimony drawn out tends to support or rebut the position taken by one or the other party.
[27]
In the case at bar, the questions of the trial judge, as shown in the above-quoted testimony of AAA, were evidently clarificatory. Propounded when the responses she gave were vague and imprecise, they cannot be considered proof of pre-judgment or bias.
As for the trial courtâs allowing the prosecution to ask AAA leading questions, no prior proof of difficulty in eliciting intelligible answers from the child witness is required in order to allow leading questions. It is sufficient that the witness is shown to be a child of tender years
[28]
 as in AAAâs case.
On the main issue of whether the prosecution had proven his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, accused-appellant contends that it had not as AAA never categorically stated that her private part was penetrated by his.
[29]
The alleged rape having been committed on July 3, 1997, the applicable law is Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659, the pertinent provision of which, in light of the allegations in the information, reads:
 Article 335. 
When and how rape is committed.
 - Rape is committed by having 
carnal knowledge of a woman
 under any of the following circumstances: 
 
By using force and intimidation;
When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and
When the woman is under twelve years of age
 or is demented. 
 The crime of rape shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.
x x x
The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
x x x
 
 
when the victim is
 a religious or 
a child below seven (7) years old.
 (Emphasis supplied). 
 
x x x
Accused-appellant argues that with AAAâs admission that she had not seen a penis, much less that of accused-appellant,
[30]
 it is 
not certain
 that what was put in her vagina was accused-appellantâs penis. The argument fails. Even if AAA did not see what object was actually placed on her vagina, given (1) her testimony that accused-appellant went on top of her, held what she felt to be his penis and put it in her vagina although it did not enter the âhole;â and (2) Dr. Maniquisâ finding of lacerations and abrasions in AAAâs vagina and her testimony quoted earlier, it is improbable that it was not accused-appellantâs penis that he held and put in her vagina. With the luxury of time afforded him, not to mention the venue of the incident where being seen and heard by anyone was remote, why would accused-appellant introduce anything but his penis to her vagina?
Villanuevaâs testimony that accused-appellant âadmitted that he was raping AAA 
but he was 
not
 
able to insert his penis
â thus assumes importance.
The penis may not have been inserted in AAAâs vagina but it was held, then put in, and therefore it penetrated, the 
labia minora
 of AAAâs vagina. AAAâs following testimony bears reiterating, quoted 
verbatim

There is then no doubt that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA. A determination of the circumstances under which the crime was committed is thus in order to arrive at the proper penalty to be imposed on him.
The information alleges that AAA was 6 years old when the crime was committed. No birth certificate or any other authentic document was presented, however, to show when she was born in order to determine her age at the time. While 
Brigida
 declared that she was born on October 22, 1990 and undertook to submit a copy of her birth certificate, no such certificate was presented.
[32]
In People v. Pruna,
[33]
 this Court set the following guidelines in appreciating age, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance:
 
The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.
n the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents such as baptismal certificate and school records which show the date of birth of the victim would suffice to prove age.
If the certificate of live birth or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or 
     otherwise 
unavailable, the testimony if clear and credible, ofthe victimâs mother or a member of the family either by affinity orconsanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigreesuch as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant toSection 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under thefollowing circumstances
:
 
 
If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;
 
If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to beproved is that she is less than 12 years old
;
 
If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to beproved is that she is less than 18 years old
.
 
 
In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victimâs mother or relatives concerning the victimâs age, the complainantâs testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.
It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall no be taken against him.
The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)
Based on the foregoing guidelines, the unavailability of the birth certificate of AAA notwithstanding, the testimony of her aunt 
Brigida
 suffices to prove that she was below 12 years old at the time of the commission of the offense.
The trial court, in imposing the penalty, appreciated the presence of aggravating circumstances that fall under the following paragraphs of Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code, to wit:
 
x x x
 
 
That the act be committed with insult or in disregard of the respect due to the offended party on account of his rank, age, or sex, or that it be committed in the dwelling of the offended party, if the latter has not given provocation. 
 
x x x
 
 
That the crime be committed in the nighttime, or in an uninhabited place, or by a band, whenever such circumstances may facilitate the commission of the offense.

These circumstances, however, may not be appreciated to modify the penalty for the rape committed â 
reclusion perpetua
 â in light of Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code which provides:
 ART. 63. 
Rules for the application of indivisible penalties.
  - In all cases in which the law prescribes a single indivisible penalty, it shall be applied by the courts 
regardless ofany mitigating or aggravating circumstances
 that may have attended the commission of the deed.
x x x (Underscoring supplied.)
But even assuming that the penalty is not single indivisible, such circumstances still can not be appreciated in the determination of the proper penalty since the Information dated August 18, 1997, failed to allege them as required by the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure which is given retroactive effect.
[34]
The failure to allege the aggravating circumstances notwithstanding, the proven presence thereof is still material in the determination of exemplary damages to be awarded to private complainant under Article 2230 of the Civil Code which provides:
 Art. 2230. In criminal offenses, exemplary damages as a part of the civil liability may be imposed when the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances. Such damages are separate and distinct from fines and shall be paid to the offended party.
As held in 
People v. Catubig
,
[35]
 the retroactive application of procedural rules cannot adversely affect the rights of the private offended party that have become vested prior to the effectivity thereof.
This Court, however, finds that, contrary to the finding of the trial court, not one of above-mentioned aggravating circumstances can be appreciated for the purpose of awarding AAA exemplary damages. It bears recalling that two hours after accused-appellant started drinking liquor at 6:00 p. m. together with his father and the latterâs two 
compadres
, or at 8:00 p. m., he asked AAA to go out. There is no showing that the circumstances of nighttime and uninhabited place were deliberately sought by accused-appellant to ensure the commission of rape. As to the circumstance of age, the same was already considered to qualify it to statutory rape. Neither can craft or fraud be appreciated, there being nothing deceitful with the way accused-appellant asked AAA to go out with him, to wit: âTy,
[36]
 we will go out for a few minutes.â
[37]
 As to the circumstance of abuse of superior strength, the same can be considered inherent in the crime of statutory rape, taking into account the disparity of age and size between accused-appellant and AAA.
A word on the civil liability of accused-appellant.
Instead of specifying the amount for each kind of damage due AAA, the trial court awarded the lump sum amount of P150,000.00 âas consequential, exemplary and moral damages.â The award of âconsequential damagesâ is more precisely termed as civil indemnity.
[38]
The penalty to be imposed on accused-appellant being 
reclusion perpetua
, in conformity with prevailing jurisprudence, the civil indemnity due should be P50,000.00,
[39]
 and moral damages should be P50,000.00.
[40]
WHEREFORE, the judgment on review is hereby 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
. As modified, accused-appellant 
RODERICK LEGASPI
 is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape and is sentenced to suffer 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay private complainant AAA civil indemnity of P50,000.00 and moral damages of P50,000.00.
