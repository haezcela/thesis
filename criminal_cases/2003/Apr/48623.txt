THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ROGER ELIARDA, APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




VITUG, J.:


A conviction or acquittal in a rape case hinges much on the credibility, or lack of it, of the supposed victim.
Roger Eliarda was charged with three counts of rape by complainant AAA, said to have been committed on 04 September 1998, 22 September 1998 and 01 October 1998, in three corresponding Informations that read:
âThat on or about the 4
th
 day of September, 1998, in the City of Laoag, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the private complainant AAA, a 38 year old woman, against her will and consent, inside the accusedâs house/residence at Brgy.

âThat on or about the 1
st
 day of October, 1998, in the City of Laoag, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the private complainant AAA, a 38 year old woman, against her will and consent, inside the complainantâs house/residence at Brgy. 
44 Zamboanga
, Laoag City.â
[1]
When arraigned, Roger Eliarda entered a plea of ânot guiltyâ to the charges. The cases were consolidated and tried jointly.
The prosecution placed at the witness stand the complainant and her aunt 
Remelita delos Santos
. The defense, in its case, presented Roger Eliarda himself and a score of witnesses, namely, Gloria Eliarda, Tecla Cacot, Edna Anac, Enida Corpuz, Hector Corpuz, Cleotilde Corpuz and Matilde Marcelo, who gave corroborative testimony.
AAA, a 38-year old single parent to a 16-year old boy, stayed in Brgy. 
44, Zamboanga
, Laoag City, at the house of her sonâs father, Felino Agustin, who migrated to the United States in September 1981. Roger Eliarda, a neighbor in Brgy. 
44
, lived just across the street. On 04 September 1998, Eliarda summoned AAA to cook for him in his house. At the time, the wife of Eliarda had left for Manila to send off her sister who was leaving for abroad. According to AAA, Eliarda poured her a glass of beer. She took it so as not to embarrass Eliarda. Moments later, she felt dizzy and sat on a wooden chair. Eliarda reached for her and embraced her. AAA resisted his embrace and tried to push him away but he was too strong for her. She ran towards the door. Eliarda caught up with her and took her to a nearby room. He laid her on the bed, pinned her two hands, and kissed her. He pulled up her blouse, removed her top undergarment and kissed her breast. AAA tried to stop Eliarda but he was just too quick for her. After removing her walking shorts, Eliarda took off his own. AAA struggled to break herself free from his grasp and moved her legs to avoid Eliarda. He spread her legs open and tried to penetrate AAA but she moved her buttocks to avoid him. Ultimately, she thrice felt the thrusts of his penis into her vagina. After a while, Eliarda stood up and put on his shorts. He warned AAA not to report the incident to anyone.
On 22 September 1998, AAA was cleaning up the yard when Eliarda approached her and remarked, âdo not mind cleaningâ up the place. She retorted that she would rather clean up her yard âthan be bitten by a snake.â She then turned her back to him and went in a huff inside her house. Eliarda followed and pushed the door open. Gaining entry into the house, he embraced and carried her to the second floor. She unsuccessfully tried to push him away. He laid her down on a wooden bed. He kissed her lips and immediately went on top of her, pulled up her blouse and kissed her breast. He removed her shorts. He raised her legs and licked her private part. Moments later, despite her struggles, he succeeded in inserting his penis into her organ.
On 01 October 1998, AAA was at home up on the second floor of the house when Eliarda came up to her. Eliarda covered her mouth to prevent her from shouting for help. He laid her on the floor. Mounting her, he kissed her lips, her breast and pulled down her shorts. He then inserted his penis into her vagina while the latter kept on struggling by wiggling her hips until ultimately his penis dangled out of her. He stood up and left.
Remelita delos Santos
, an aunt of AAA, testified that her niece confided to her the last sexual assault. She was present when barangay officials came to AAA and encouraged her to settle the case amicably. She said that the Eliarda couple went to AAA to ask for her forgiveness but the latter was unmoved.
In his testimony, Roger Eliarda insisted that he and AAA were lovers and that the sexual encounters were consensual. According to Eliarda, he was smitten by AAAâs charm and manners. His admiration for AAA grew when she would frequent his house to take care of his mother-in-law. He took care of AAA when she was sick and he would oftentimes attend to her. While he tried to be discreet about their affair, his wife, however, ultimately found out and he was constrained to confess to her that AAA was his mistress. He denied having forced the complainant in all three occasions of sexual congress between them.
Tecla Cacot, Edna Anac, Hector Corpuz, Enida Corpuz, and Mrs. Gloria Eliarda, sought to corroborate the claim of Eliarda. The witnesses intimated that Eliarda and AAA maintained an amorous relationship and that AAA never behaved like being a rape victim.
When the trial concluded, the court a quo found Eliarda guilty of the crimes charged, discarding thereby the âsweetheart theoryâ advanced by the defense. The trial court held:
âACCORDINGLY, after assiduously weighing the evidence for the prosecution and the defense, the Court is morally convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the accused Roger Eliarda is GUILTY of the crime of Rape in all the three (3) criminal Informations filed against him.
âHe is hereby sentenced to the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua with all the accessory penalties provided by law in each of the crime charged. Likewise, he is ordered to pay a civil indemnity of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) and moral damages of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) for each of the three (3) crimes committed; and to pay the costs.â
[2]
In this appeal, Roger Eliarda would have this Court overturn his conviction upon the thesis that AAA failed to pass the test of credibility.
The factual findings of the trial court on this issue are held to be, as it is so often said, entitled to the highest degree of respect by an appellate court
[3]
 but when something critical and significant would appear to have been ignored or missed, the essence in an appellate review,
[4]
 such evaluation made by the trial court may have to be re-examined.

âFiscal Asencion

âATTY. LAZO:
 
 
 
 
At any rate, Madam Witness, you say that when he went on top of you, you also shouted especially at that time when you felt that he was then removing his shorts with his two hands?

Yes, sir, I was then pleading to him.
 
 
âQ.
Madam Witness, when your hands were then released why did you not scratch the face or any part of the body of the accused in order to resist the alleged attempt of the accused on your womanhood?
 
 
âA.
I tried to push him, sir.
 
 
âQ.
At any rate, Madam Witness, you also stated in your affidavit in your answer to question No. 9 you were saying that you were closing your thighs when you said â
ip-ipitek ti mabagbaguik
,â you were closing your thighs to hide your vagina, that is what you mean?

On cross-examination, she elaborated:
âQ
 
Madam Witness, when you were inside the house you were pinned against the back of the door by the accused and the next thing that happened is â he carried you to the wooden bed, is that correct?
 
 
âA
Before he did that I pleaded to him not to repeat what he had done to me and he said `Even if somebody sees me I fear no one.â
 
 
âQ
But after that he carried you to the wooden bed?
 
 
âA
He laid me there, sir.
 
 
âQ
Is it not a fact, that when you were carried to the wooden bed you shouted again, Madam Witness, for help?
 
 
âA
Yes, sir, but nobody heard me because the volume of our radio was loud.
 
 
âQ
And you shouted at the top of your voice?
 
 
âA
Yes, sir.
 
 
âQ
Now, Madam Witness, after you were laid down on the wooden bed by the accused Roger Eliarda you were again carried to a room at the second floor of the house where you were then staying, is it not?
 
 
âA
Yes, sir.
 
 
âx x x            x x x            x x x
 
 
 
âQ
 
Now, Madam Witness, when you were being carried from the ground floor to the second floor, naturally, you were struggling, in fact, you were struggling with all your strength just to make sure that what had happened to you on September 4, 1998 will not be repeated on that day?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
One hand of the accused was below your neck and the other was under your thighs, as you demonstrated, right?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
That was the way that you were carried by the accused going up the stairs to the second floor of your house?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir, and my two hands were pinned so it is only my legs that were free and moving.
 
 
 
âQ
 
You were moving your legs because they were free, right?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
Madam Witness, when you were brought to the room upstairs the window of that room was opened but there was a curtain hanging covering the lower half of the open window?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
Of course, in the same manner that you were shouting when you were being carried to the wooden bed from the ground floor to the second floor, you were shouting at [the] top of your voice?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
Even when you were already inside the room you were still shouting at the top of your voice?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
You stated that when you were already at the second floor of the house where you were then staying, the accused after laying you down on the bed immediately went on top of you, is that true?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
When he was on top of you he again kissed your lips and you reacted by moving your head left to right, is that correct?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
After he kissed you he again moved his face down to your breast and he again pulled up your blouse, is that correct?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
Now, Madam Witness, after he was able to pull up your blouse he removed your shorts?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
Despite the fact that you were then holding on to your shorts, the accused was able to remove it?
 
 
 
âA
 
When I lost my strength that was the time when the accused was able to pull down my shorts, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
After he was able to remove your shorts, according to you, he also removed your panty, right?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
Now, you were asked: `After he succeeded in removing your panty, what did he do next?â and the answer you gave was: `He raised my two legs,â is that true?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
Of course, by doing that he let go off his grip on your two hands, grabbed your legs and raised it, right?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
And you were also asked: `After raising your two legs, what happened nextâ and you said: `He kissed my private part,â right?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
He did not only kissed your private part according to you he also licked your private part?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
That statement of yours is based on your answer on question no. 16 which states the question [of] which is: `And what else transpired nextâ and your answer was: `When I lost my strength and he was able to pull down my shorts, he raised my two legs and he kissed my private part and he licked it and I was not able to notice him remove his shorts because all of a sudden he inserted his penis in my private part but he was not able to [insert] his penis deeply in my private part because I struggled so he said: 
`Magoncilla can sa man metâ
 - `as if it is your first time,â was that the question asked of you and that is the answer you gave?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
You were asked - `after he licked your private part, what happened nextâ and the answer you gave was - `the accused went on top of me,â right?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
When he went on top of you, you were asked what did he do and you said he inserted his penis in your private part, right?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âx x x            x x x            x x x
 
 
 
âQ
 
Did you say that he went on top of you and tried to [insert] his penis into your vagina?
 
 
 
âA
 
He first spread my two legs, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
Do you mean to say that before he went on top of you your legs were together?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
Are you sure?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir, because he was the one who spread my legs.
 
 
 
âQ
 
You were asked on direct, Madam, `how long did he lick your private partâ and you said `not so long,â is that true?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
You were asked - `after that, what did he do nextâ and you said `he went on top of me, sir,â is that true?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
So, do we get from you that after he licked your private part immediately he went on top of you?
 
 
 
âA
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
Are you sure of that Madam Witness?
 
 
 
âA
Yes, sir.â

The witness representing the supposed accused went on top of the body of the supposed victim holding the two hands of the supposed victim with her two hands which were placed beside the head of the supposed victim and the two legs of the witness representing the accused were placed in between the two legs of the supposed victim).

[10]
On cross-examination, AAA further declared:
âQ.

[11]
Owing to the character of the crime of rape, the testimony of the victim is the focal area around which the outcome of the charge would naturally revolve. The consistency on material points, or lack of it, can sustain or negate a conviction. Correspondingly, the stringency with which the account of the victim undergoes scrutiny becomes even more pronounced where a conviction could forfeit the life or liberty of an accused. In an acquittal, an accused is set free not necessarily because he did not commit the offense but, more likely than not, because the exacting proof for conviction may not have been met. A person is presumed innocent of a crime unless his guilt has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt. Thus, an acquittal does not always mean that the defense evidence is given full credence but, rather, that the prosecution has failed to overcome the presumption of innocence.
The court, in this instance, has concluded, after having spent much time in deliberating on the case, that the burden of the prosecution has not been satisfied.
AAA claimed to have pushed the appellant away in all of three incidents complained of. While it may be said that tenacious resistance from the victim is not a requirement for the crime of rape
[12]
, the lack of evidence signifying an obstinate resistance to submit to the intercourse, naturally expected from an unwilling victim, could likewise indicate that no rape has occurred.
[13]
 It eludes the Court that AAA could not have posed more than what she did to successfully dissuade appellant who was not even armed during all three instances from having his way.
The âsweetheart theoryâ has often been discarded and has rightly been held to be a weak defense in an indictment for rape. It would be wrong to say, however, that, under all events, that defense should be altogether ignored. Corroborative evidence is ample to suggest the veracity of appellantâs claim.
Tecla Cacot, Edna Anac, Enida Corpuz and Hector Corpuz related in court that even after the supposed rape incidents, they would regularly gather under a 
manzanita
 tree, drink beer and eat besuto. During these occasions, AAA was observed to have shown no signs of having been a rape victim but, on the contrary, was enjoying herself with the rest of the group. Enida testified to the âunusual closenessâ between AAA and Eliarda. Edna said that one time AAA even reserved a seat for appellant and later offered him a drink. Hector Corpuz witnessed the confrontation between the wife of appellant, Mrs. Eliarda, and AAA when the former accused AAA of carrying on with appellant. In October 1998, or a few weeks after the last sexual congress, AAA herself admitted to have gone to appellantâs house to join his family in commemorating the death anniversary of his mother-in-law. Corroborative evidence that tend to support the sweetheart theory could assume importance when there are reasons to entertain some doubts on the accuracy of the stance taken by the prosecution.
[14]
The Court, given all the circumstances, must hold that the prosecution has failed to discharge the onus probandi on the requisite evidentiary quantum for a pronouncement of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The constitutional presumption of innocence in favor of the appellant, not having been sufficiently rebutted, judicial conscience would not rest easy with a conviction.
WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment of the court a quo is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Appellant ROGER ELIARDA is hereby ACQUITTED on reasonable doubt, and his immediate release from confinement, unless there are other valid and lawful grounds to still hold him, is hereby ordered. The Director of the Bureau of Correction is directed to inform this Court of its compliance with this judgment. Costs
