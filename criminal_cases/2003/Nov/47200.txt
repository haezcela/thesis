D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


There is no standard form of behavior of a rape victim, especially when she is of tender years. In this case, the young victim clearly and definitively described her horrifying ordeal in the hands of appellant. In effect, she has said all that is required to prove her ravishment.
The Case
Felix Montes appeals the April 4, 2001 Decision

The Facts 
Version of the Prosecution
In its Brief,
[9]
 the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the prosecution's version of the facts in the following manner:
"On October 17, 1995, about 6 o'clock in the morning, twelve-year[-]old Analyn P. Mendez [hereinafter, private complainant] was in their house in Yellowbell Street, UPS IV, ParaÃ±aque, Metro Manila, cleaning their house. After doing her chore, [private complainant] and her sister, Ronalyn Mendez, went out of their house to fetch water.
"Outside their house, the two (2) sisters met appellant who was their neighbor. Appellant summoned [private complainant] to buy `pandesal'; hence, she did not go with Ronalyn  x x x anymore.
"After buying `pandesal,' [private complainant] borrowed from appellant his bicycle in his vulcanizing shop fronting his house. Using the bicycle, [private complainant] went to the place where they [usually go to] to fetch water to check if it was their turn to get water.
"Afterwards, [private complainant] returned to their house. Upon reaching the front of their house, Ronalyn x x x borrowed the bicycle from her[,] to which [private complainant] acceded. Then, Ronalyn x x x headed towards the place where they [fetch] water. [Private complainant] was left behind waiting for Ronalyn x x x to return.
"While [private complainant] was waiting for Ronalyn x x x in front of their house, appellant called her to wash the dishes inside his house.
"When [private complainant] was washing the dishes, appellant went outside his house. After washing the dishes, [private complainant] wanted to go outside appellant's house. However, she was not able to do so because the door was locked.  [Private complainant] kept on trying to open the door but failed. Just as she was trying to open the door again, she heard appellant behind the door about to get in. Consequently, [private complainant] said: `Buksan mo ito.' Appellant opened the door but he did not let [private complainant] go out.  Instead, he gave [private complainant] a glass of [C]oca-[C]ola and `pandesal.' After finishing the food which appellant gave her, [private complainant] was not allowed by appellant to go out of his house.
"Thereafter, appellant went inside his kitchen.  Before doing so, he told [private complainant] to stay because he was going to give her something. When he returned from the kitchen, appellant was already holding a foot-long knife. [He then] pointed the knife at [private complainant] and warned her not to shout; otherwise, he would kill her. He ordered [private complainant] to transfer the chair near the table inside his room and [private complainant] obeyed. After that, appellant went inside his room and ordered [private complainant] to lie down on his bed. [Private complainant] refused to lie down.  At this juncture, somebody from the outside called appellant. Appellant consequently peeped through the door to look [at] who was calling. When appellant peeped through the door, he was only two (2) arms length away from [private complainant].  [Private complainant] tried to escape by heading towards the kitchen because there was an opening leading outside. However, appellant was able to hold her arm and ordered her to go back to his room.
"Inside the room, appellant undressed [private complainant]. While appellant was undressing her, [private complainant] kept on saying: `Ayaw ko.' Appellant told her that if she would not follow him, he would stab her.  After removing [private complainant's] dress and short pants, appellant ordered her to lie down. Appellant was holding the knife when he ordered [private complainant] to lie down. Appellant then inserted his organ into [private complainant's] organ. [Private complainant] felt pain when appellant inserted his penis inside her vagina.
"While appellant was doing the dastardly acts, somebody from the outside called appellant.  The person who called appellant wanted to have a vulcanizing service. Immediately, appellant dressed up and went outside his house. Before he went out, he locked the door of his room; hence, [private complainant] was not able to get out.
"Subsequently, [private complainant] heard her sister Ronalyn x x x ask appellant if [private complainant] was inside his [appellant's] house. Appellant replied in the negative. [Private complainant] was afraid to shout because she was reminded of the knife which appellant placed on top of the table near appellant's room.
"When appellant returned, he tied [private complainant's] hands and feet with a cord[,] x x x [a] half centimeter in diameter.
"On the night of October 18, 1995, or the following night, appellant again raped [private complainant]. Before he raped her, he untied [private complainant].  After untying her, he undressed her and made her lie down. Immediately thereafter, appellant went on top of her and inserted his penis inside her vagina. [Private complainant] again felt pain. Appellant was likewise armed with a knife at that time.
"In the early morning of October 19, 1995, appellant again raped [private complainant]. She testified that appellant again tied her after the second rape.  Appellant untied her before raping her for the third time. On the third assault, appellant again undressed her.  After undressing her, appellant put her to bed, went on top of her and then inserted his penis inside her vagina. [Private complainant] felt pain all over her body after appellant raped her.
"Thereafter, [private complainant] asked appellant to let her go because her mother would be looking for her. Appellant  replied that he would release her later.  He also told [private complainant] that he would give her the amount of P50.00.
"About 6:30 a.m. of that day, appellant finally allowed [private complainant] to leave using the back door.  Before [private complainant] left appellant's house, appellant gave her P50.00 and told her not to immediately go home. He told her to go to the YP at the Uniwide to buy food and give some to her siblings.
"[Private complainant] proceeded to the Uniwide. She stayed there until 5 o'clock in the afternoon roaming around. She was afraid to go home because she thought that her mother might whip her.
"About 5 o'clock in the afternoon, [private complainant] went home. When she arrived at their house, she saw her parents who told her that appellant would be put to jail because her dress was seen inside appellant's house. [Private complainant] did not tell her parents about the horrifying experience she had undergone because she was scared that her parents might punish her.
"Eventually, [private complainant], together with her mother, went to the Barangay Hall and reported to the barangay officials what appellant did to her.  Thereafter, [private complainant] executed her statement before the police."
[10]
Version of the Defense
Appellant interposes the defenses of denial and alibi.  In his Brief,
[11]
 he presents the following version of the facts:
"Accused, Felix [Montes], who is a driver by occupation, testified that the victim and her family are his neighbors for quite a number of years. The victim's family collects garbage.  x x x [Upon her mother's orders], the victim x x x collect[s] [his] garbage, and by reason thereof, he gives her money from time to time.
"On October 17, 1995, at about 10:30 in the morning, while he was preparing to drive some of the school children waiting in front of his house, two (2) policemen arrived, held his arm, brought him inside his room and searched his whole house.  He asked for the reason [for] his arrest but was not given an answer. When they were about to go out, the victim's mother went inside the comfort room of the house, found the victim's clothes and brought it out. Accused touched the victim's clothes, allegedly retrieved from his bathroom, and realized that [they  were] still damp.
"He was brought to the police station in Bicutan, where he was detained from October 17, 1995 to October 23, 1995 without any charges being filed against him. He only came to know of the rape charge against him, when the barangay officials brought the victim and her mother to the police station on October 21,1995.  The victim and her mother executed their sworn statements. Thereafter, he was transferred to the ParaÃ±aque City Jail.
"Accused denies culpability of the crime, and that the victim told him that the accusation was made only to extort money from him and to reimburse the barangay officials who were helping the family in their living expenses.
"The victim's mother, Evelyn Mendez, was presented to testify on the due execution and authenticity of her signature in the Affidavit of Desistance which was executed on June 3, 1996."
[12]
Ruling of the Trial Court
After evaluating the evidence on record, the court 
a quo
 found that the testimony of the victim on the three counts of rape was clear, convincing, positive and consistent with human nature and the ordinary course of things. Noting her age, it also held that it was improbable that she would have publicly admitted that she had been ravished and her honor tainted by the accused, if the incidents of rape were not true.
Dismissing the denial proffered by the accused, the court stressed that such defense was inherently weak and had always been disfavored by the courts vis-Ã -vis the clear and categorical narrative of the victim.
The RTC likewise ruled that the Affidavit of Desistance
[13]
 allegedly executed by the victim after the institution of the criminal action had neither been submitted in court nor affirmed by her.  Moreover, it pointed out that desistance in seduction, abduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness cannot be a ground for dismissing the action.  Once the case is filed in court, it is no longer the victim's right to decide whether or not to continue it.
Hence, this appeal.
[14]
The Issue
Before us, appellant assigns this single error for our consideration:
"The Court 
a quo 
erred in finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape."
[15]
The Court's Ruling
The appeal has no merit.
Lone Issue: 
Guilt Beyond Reasonable Doubt
Appellant contends that the trial court's complete reliance on the testimony of the alleged victim was misplaced, because her actions after the alleged rape were contrary to the normal behavior of one who was raped three times for three consecutive days. He considers the following behavior unusual: 
 first
, she did not go home immediately after he had supposedly released her; 
second
, after she was missing from home for three days, she concealed her horrible ordeal from her parents, supposedly because she was afraid of being scolded; 
third
, she preferred to relate her harrowing experience to barangay officials who were complete strangers, rather than to her parents.
Appellant also faults the court 
a quo
 for not giving weight to her Affidavit of Desistance which, though she did not affirm, allegedly impaired her credibility. In addition, he stressed that the prosecution failed to present the record of his arrest, which would have proved that he was in jail when the incidents of rape were allegedly committed.
Credibility of Complainant's Testimony
There is no standard form of behavior when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful event,
[16] 
 especially in the heinous crime of rape. It has long been recognized that the human mind works unpredictably when placed under emotional stress. 
[17]
 Rape victims have exhibited such an incalculable range of emotions that it is unrealistic to expect uniform reactions from them.
[18]
 Hence, it is with good reason that the Court has not laid down any rule on how a rape victim should behave immediately after her ravishment.
[19]
Moreover, it is not proper to judge by adult norms of behavior the actions of children who have undergone traumatic experiences.
[20]
  Certainly, a child cannot be expected to act like an adult or do what may be expected of mature people under similar circumstances.
[21]
These legal precepts point out the folly of the contentions of appellant about the behavior of complainant. The fact that she did not immediately go home after being released by him was not unnatural.  Shaken by fear of his threats and the offense to her honor, there is no telling how she should have acted upon her release.  Neither is it farfetched to believe that her days in captivity and his threats on her life left a lingering effect on her young and impressionable mind, prompting her to follow his explicit instructions not to go home immediately.  We quote from the cross-examination as follows:

Neither is the initial reluctance of a rape victim in revealing the assault on her virtue uncommon.
[25] 
 Cases have shown that young girls usually conceal their ordeal because of threats made by their assailants.
[26]
  In this case, the records more than sufficiently established that appellant had threatened the young girl.
Neither was the credibility of complainant impugned by her failure to divulge the crime to her parents immediately.  Her hesitation may be attributable to her age and the threats against her.
[27]
  Indeed, it is not unlikely for a minor to be intimidated into silence by the mildest threat on her life.
[28]
In a litany of cases, this Court has ruled that the testimonies of child- victims of rape are to be given full weight and credence.
[29]
 Reason and experience dictate that a girl of tender years, who barely understands sex and sexuality, is unlikely to impute to any man a crime so serious as rape, if what she claims is not true.
[30]
  Her candid narration of how she was raped bears the earmarks of credibility, especially if no ill will -- as in this case -- motivates her to testify falsely against the accused.
[31]
  It is well-settled that when a woman, more so when she is a minor, says she has been raped, she says in effect all that is required to prove the ravishment.
[32]
 The accused may thus be convicted solely on her testimony -- provided it is credible, natural, convincing and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.
[33]
Here, complainant vividly recited details of the rape incidents. Her narration was straightforward, categorical and unflawed by any material or significant inconsistency.  She did not waver even during extensive cross-examination by the defense counsel. Seen through the eyes of a guileless and hapless girl, the ordeal was narrated as follows:

Prosecutor Garcia:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Already answered, there was an order. Allegedly she was ordered by the accused to bring that chair inside the room.

When the accused peeped at the door, why did you not shout?
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Natatakot nga po ako eh!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
And after that incident, what happened?
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Sinaraduhan niya po `yong pinto.

A 
 
Pinasok niya na po ako doon sa kuwarto.

Q 
 
Aside from saying 'ayaw ko', what did you do?
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Sabi niya `pag hindi ko raw po siya sinunod sasaksakin niya na po ako.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
So, you were the one who undressed yourself?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prosecutor Garcia:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Objection, Your Honor please, that is misleading. As testified by the witness, 'Hinubaran niya po ako.'
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Court:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Misleading, objection is sustained.

Short[s] po.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
Then?
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Pinahiga niya po ako sa kama.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
Then the accused raped you?
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Opo.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
And why did you not shout while the accused was raping you?
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
May hawak siyang kutsilyo eh! pa'no ako makakasigaw.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
How did the accused rape you?
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Pinasok niya po `yong ari niya sa ari ko po.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
You said that the accused forced you to lie down on the bed. The accused was then standing, is that correct?
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
 Opo.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q 
 
Immediately after the accused removed your dress and your short[s], he raped you, is that correct?
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Opo."

The trial court thus found private complainant's testimony to be both credible and convincing. It is a settled doctrine that the competence and the credibility of witnesses are best determined by the trial court,
[36]
 because it has the unique opportunity of observing their deportment on the stand while testifying.
[37]
  Its findings -- absent any arbitrariness or oversight of facts or circumstances of weight and substance -- are final and conclusive upon this Court and will not be disturbed on appeal.
[38]
Appellant's Defenses
As to appellant's denial and alibi, the trial court was correct in brushing these aside for being uncorroborated and unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence. As a rule, these defenses are negative and self-serving and are always received with caution -- not only because they are inherently weak and unreliable, but also because they are easy to fabricate.
[39]
  They cannot prevail over, and are worthless in the face of, positive identification by a credible witness
[40]
 or the positive and categorical statements of the victim.
[41]
As admitted by appellant, the alleged Affidavit of Desistance of the victim was never identified by her, but submitted in court only after the institution of the rape cases. Such being the case, the Affidavit -- even when construed as a pardon in the erstwhile "private crime" of rape
[42]
 -- is not a ground for the dismissal of the criminal cases, since the actions have already been instituted.
[43]
 To justify the dismissal of the Complaints, the pardon should have been made prior to the institution of the criminal actions.
[44]
Finally, weak and unconvincing was the alibi of appellant that he was in jail when the alleged rape incidents were committed. Having proffered this matter, he had the burden to prove it with competent evidence. For him to now place the blame on the prosecution for allegedly failing to produce the record of his arrest is against the fundamental rule that upon those who allege rests the burden of proof.

 Under the Anti- Rape Law of 1997 (RA No. 8493), the crime of rape has been reclassified from a crime against chastity to a crime against persons, and it may now be prosecuted even without the initiative or even consent of the offended party. Since the crime in this case was committed in 1995, RA No. 8353 was inapplicable.
