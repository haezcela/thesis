For automatic review is the May 11, 1999 decision
[1]

,

Criminal Case No. RTC 98-7310
That on or about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of June 1, 1998 in Barangay 
Dalipay
, Municipality of 
Milaor
, Camarines Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with grave abuse of confidence, 
the victim being his daughter
, by means of force and intimidation, with lewd designs, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeed in having sexual intercourse with one 
AAA
, a 
14 year old girl
, against her will and without her consent and of which carnal knowledge resulted in the pregnancy of the latter to her damage and prejudice in such amount as shall be proven in court.
Acts contrary to law.
[3]
 (Emphasis supplied)
The prosecution established the following facts:
The victim, AAA, the seventh of ten children of appellant and his wife 
Dominga Madera
, was born on February 10, 1985.
[4]
At around 8:00 p.m. of May 8, 1998, the eve of the barangay fiesta at 
Dalipay
, 
Milaor
, Camarines Sur, appellant, after drinking liquor with his friends in the porch of his three-bedroom
[5]
 house at said barangay, repaired to his bedroom. He thereupon summoned the then more than 13 years old AAA, who obliged and went to his room upon which "he closed the door but there is a small opening."
[6]
 On appellant's request, AAA massaged him in the course of which he took off her shorts and panty, after which he also took off his shorts and brief, and laid down on top of her, spread her thighs and inserted his penis into her vagina.
[7]
 She felt pain but was too afraid to complain or ask why he was doing that to her because he threatened to kill all of them in the family if she shouted
[8]
 and she feared he would do it as he had often maltreated her and her siblings as well as her mother.
[9]
On June 1, 1998, at around 3:00 p.m., while AAA's mother was in the fields and her brothers and sisters were playing at a chapel some 150 meters away from their house, appellant entered AAA's room as she was about to sleep on a mat placed on the cemented floor.  Again appellant had sexual intercourse with AAA,
[10]
 without her shouting for help because he told her that he would kill all of them if she shouted.
[11]
More than three months after the June 1, 1998 sexual intercourse, or on September 27, 1998, AAA related to her sister 
Josephine
 the two sexual molestations committed on her by appellant.
[12]
 The following day or on September 28, 1998, Dr. Ma. Linda Llaguno, Municipal Health Officer of 
Milaor
, Camarines Sur, examined AAA and found her to be pregnant.
More than seven months after the sexual molestation committed on May 8, 1998, or on December 25
, 
1998, AAA gave birth to a baby girl.
[13]
Appellant, the sole witness for the defense, denied the charges
[14]
 and gave the following version:
On May 8, 1998, he was cooking food for the fiesta to be celebrated on the next day. With him were his wife's relatives who were there for the next day's festivities. His older children 
Joseph
, 
Jobert
, 
Juvy
 and AAA had gone to the dance hall, while his younger children stayed at home. He finished cooking at 10:00 p.m., and at around 10:30 p.m., he went with his brothers-in-law Dante and Roger to the dance hall but he did not see AAA there.
[15]
On June 1, 2002, he and his son 
Jobert
 harrowed the more than 2-hectare field of one Cipriano San Felipe, some 200 meters away from his house.
[16]
 He started working at 8:00 a.m. and stopped at 4:00 p.m., and neither he nor his son went home for lunch as they partook of it at the house of Cipriano's son-in-law.
[17]
 After working in the fields, he pastured his carabao and returned home only at 6:00 p.m.
[18]
He did not know why his wife and AAA, whom he suspected has a boyfriend named Boboy, would charge him with rape, except perhaps because he and his wife were always quarreling.
[19]
The trial court, finding for the prosecution, convicted appellant of two counts of rape by the decision on review, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, this court finds the accused ROBERTO MADERA y AGRAVANTE 
GUILTY
 beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of the crime of 
RAPE
, defined and penalized under Article 355
 
of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act Nos. 7659 and 8353 in Criminal Cases Nos. 98-7309 and 98-7310 and hereby sentences the said accused to suffer the penalty of 
DEATH
 for each of the offense committed. Accused Roberto Madera y Agravante is hereby ordered to pay the victim AAA the amount of 
P50,000.00 for each offense by way of moral damages
 and to serve as a deterrent and warning to fathers who may have bestial desire against their daughter, said accused is also ordered to pay the sum of 
P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.
  For having impregnated his own daughter resulting to giving birth to a child who is facing an unsecured future and for the traumatic experience suffered by the victim, the accused is further ordered to pay 
P100,000.00 by way of consequential damages
 and to pay the costs.
[20]
SO ORDERED. (Underscoring supplied)
In his brief, appellant raises the following assigned errors, quoted 
verbatim:
I
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING UNDUE IMPORTANCE TO THE 
INCREDIBLE, UNRELIABLE AND UNWORTHY
 STANCE OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT ANENT THE ALLEGED SEXUAL ACTS COMPLAINED OF
II
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN 
NOT CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT PROSECUTION WITNESS 
DOMINGA MADERA
 WAS ACTUATED BY ILL WILL IN TESTIFYING AGAINST ACCUSED-APPELLANT
III
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN 
NOT GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE DEFENSE INTERPOSED BY ACCUSED-APPELLANT
IV
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF TWO (2) COUNTS OF RAPE DESPITE THE FACT THAT 
HIS GUILT WAS NOT PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
The settled rule is that when the issue involves the credibility of a witness, the trial court's assessment is entitled to great weight, even finality, unless it is shown that it was tainted with arbitrariness or there was an oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence. The reason is obvious - the trial court has the unique opportunity to observe the witness firsthand and note his or her demeanor and manner of testifying.
[21]
The trial court found AAA a credible witness and appreciated her clear and convincing testimony on how the rapes were committed. Thus, after identifying her father in open court by pointing to him during which she was crying,
[22]
 she, a month and 14 years of age when she testified on March 4, 1999, declared as follows, quoted 
verbatim:

Yes. Ma'am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pros. Escaro: 
May I make of record, your honor, that the witness is crying as she is testifying on that point.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Atty. CariÃ±o:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q : 
 
But at that time, AAA, you can still shout, is it not?
 
 
 
 
 
A : 
 
I could not shout because he threatened me that all of us would be killed if I shout

Q : 
 
Since on May 8, 1998, that was the same procedure, that was the same thing that your father did to you when your father started to remove your short pants and panty, did you not do anything?
 
 
 
 
 
A : 
 
I have not done anything, Ma'am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q : 
 
But you would know, AAA, that your father will do something wrong to you again, is it not?
 
 
 
 
 
A :
 
Yes, I know that, Ma'am.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q : 
 
So you could have shouted or struggled with your father at that time?
 
 
 
 
 
A : 
 
I could not do that, Ma'am, because he would kill all of us.

[26]
 
 
From the foregoing candid, categorical and straightforward sob-punctuated narration by AAA of the incidents, it is not difficult to believe that indeed the young girl who had just metamorphosed into a teenager was twice ravished by her father who was looked upon with fear as "he always hurt [her]" as well as her 9 siblings and their mother by boxing and kicking them.
The argument that appellant could not have raped AAA on May 8, 1998 because her mother and her siblings were not yet asleep as they were watching television in the next room and were aware that she had been summoned to massage him does not persuade. Lust is no respecter of time, place or kinship.
[27]
 Given the sound and the attention the television drew from the viewers, and the location of the door which was ajar, as reflected in AAA's sketch - Exhibit "H"
[28]
 which shows such door to be 
along the same side where the television was mounted,
 the viewers could not have been aware of, seen or sensed what was happening inside the room where the molestation took place.
Had the charge for the May 8, 1998 incident been concocted, AAA could just have tailored her account by, e. g., omitting that portion of her testimony regarding the presence of family members at the time of the incident and about the door being left ajar. Or she could have inputed some details that could render her account more in accordance with common experience, like appellant kissing her on parts of her body before having an intercourse. That she did not, thus making her tale appear improbable, reinforces her credibility. For that something improbable can happen is always possible.
[29]
 As for appellant's alibi with respect to the second case, - that he was on the afternoon of June 1, 1998 with his son 
Jobert
 tilling the farm of a certain Cipriano San Felipe which was located some two hundred meters away from his house,
[30]
 it is inherently weak and unreliable. For given that distance between the place where he was, and the scene of the crime,
[31]
 it was not physically impossible for him to be at the latter. That neither his son nor farm owner San Felipe came forward to corroborate his alibi all the more renders his alibi weak.
While, as reflected in AAA's testimony she offered no physical resistance nor attempted to shout, she explained that she was intimidated and threatened into silence, appellant having readily instilled fear in her when he threatened "that all of us would be killed" if she shouted.
Intimidation must be viewed in light of the victim's perception and judgment at the time of the commission of the crime and not by any hard and fast rule. It suffices that the threat or intimidation produces a reasonable fear in the mind of the victim that if she resists or does not yield to the desires of appellant, the threat would be carried out.
[32]
 AAA's explanation is not difficult to appreciate, given her claim that appellant had been cruel and often maltreated her, her siblings and her mother, which claim was confirmed at the witness stand by her mother 
Dominga Cadores Agravante
[33]
 who added that they could not get back at appellant because "if he had with him a bolo, he unsheathed his bolo."
At any rate, in AAA's sworn statement
[34]
 executed on September 28, 1998 before SPO3 Willie C. Miraflores at the office of the Chief of Police of 
Milaor
 Municipal Police Station and subscribed and sworn to before Camaligan, Camarines Sur Municipal Circuit Trial Court Judge Jose P. Nacional, she declared that appellant "forcibly" had sexual intercourse with her both on May 8, 1998 and June 1, 1998. Thus she declared:
 
 
 
 
Q : 
 
Why are you here in this office and giving this statement?
 
 
 
 
A : 
 
To testify and file a formal complaint against my father Roberto Madera y Doe for Rape.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q : 
 
When and where [did] this incident happe[n]?
 
 
 
 
A : 
 
It transpired on or about 8:00 o'clock in the evening of May 8, 1997 (sic) and on June 1, 1998 inside our house at barangay 
Dalipay
, this municipality.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q : 
 
How did it happen [o]n the night of May 8, 1998?
 
 
 
 
 
A : 
 
That on the said date at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening we were watching TV in the sala with my mother, brothers and sisters while my father was having a drinking spree with his intimates in the terrace (balcon). Afterwards, my father g[o]t inside the house and he told [me] to foll[ow] him inside the room for he has something to tell me. Once inside, he 
forcibly
 let me lay on the bed and pulled down my underwear and have a sexual intercourse with me.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q : 
 
Why did you not shout nor ask an (sic) assistance from your mother and others who were in the sala?
 
 
 
 
 
A : 
 
It is because my father threatens me in a low voice to be killed if I shout (sic).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q : 
 
What happened on June 1, 1998 at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon?
 
 
 
 
 
A : 
 
That on the said time and date, my mother was away from the house and my brothers and sisters were playing in the other place. I am in the house with my father and the latter 
forcibly have another sexual intercourse with me.
 (Emphasis supplied)
 
 
The sworn statement was offered
[35]
 and admitted
[36]
 in evidence during AAA's direct examination during which she affirmed the truth thereof.
[37]
At all events, as between a father and his daughter in an incestuous sexual assault, this Court has upheld the view that the former's 
moral ascendancy and influence over the latter sufficiently substitutes for force and intimidation.
[38]
 
To justify the imposition of the death penalty in a case for qualified rape, the victim's minority and relationship with the offender must be alleged in the complaint or information, as they have been in the informations filed against appellant.
And relationship and minority as qualifying circumstances of rape must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, just as the crime itself.
[39]
The prosecution presented a birth certificate to establish AAA's minority and relationship to appellant.  The name appearing in the certification
[40]
 issued by the Office of the Civil Registrar of 
Milaor
 and in the Certificate of Live Birth
[41]
 is 
AAA
.  The two informations alleged that the victim is 
AAA
.
AAA's mother 
Dominga Madera
 testified, however, that there was a misspelling of AAA's name in the Certificate of Live Birth, a typographical error.
[42]
Except for the misspelling of the letter n which appears as "m" in AAA, all the entries in AAA's Birth Certificate are undisputed. Thus it shows that she was born on February 16, 1985 to Domingo Lormeda Cadores and herein appellant Roberto Agravante Madera, and that the couple got married on December 27, 1967 at Minalabac, Camarines Sur.
Relation and minority having been alleged and proved, the imposition by the trial court of the death penalty in both cases must thus be affirmed.
Conformably with prevailing jurisprudence, the decision on the civil aspect of the case must be modified such that AAA is awarded civil indemnity of P75,000.00 for each count of rape, moral damages of P75,000.00 also for each count, and exemplary damages of P25,000.00, also for each count.
WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Naga, Branch 25, finding appellant Roberto Madera y Agravante guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Qualified Rape and sentencing him to death in both cases is AFFIRMED. The civil aspect of the case is MODIFIED by awarding to private complainant AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil liability, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape.
Three justices of the Court, however, continue to maintain the unconstitutionality of R.A. 7659 insofar as it prescribes the death penalty. Nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the majority to the effect that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty can be lawfully imposed in the cases at bar.
In accordance with Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 25 of R.A. 7659, upon finality of this Decision, let the records of these cases be forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of executive clemency.
