PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RICO B. BAGAUA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


This is an appeal from the decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court of Tuao, Cagayan, Branch 11, 
in Criminal Case No. 646-T, finding accused-appellant guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and sentencing him to suffer the 
penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay the private complainant AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and 
P50,000.00 as moral damages.
  
 The information reads:
  


 That on or about May 31, 1997, in the Municipality of Piat, 
Province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the said accused Rico B. Bagaua with lewd design and by the use 
of force and intimidation did then and there willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously hold the breast, embrace, kiss held the private parts and 
have sexual intercourse with the offended party AAA against
 her will.


 Contrary to law.
[2]
 




 When arraigned on January 13, 1998, accused-appellant entered a 
negative plea. After trial on the merits, the trial court rendered the 
appealed judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads:
  


 WHEREFORE, and in view of all the foregoing, the court finds the
 guilt of the accused Rico B. Bagaua of the crime of rape defined and 
penalized under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code to have been 
duly established beyond reasonable doubt and hereby sentences him to 
suffer the penalty of 
Reclusion Perpetua
. He is further sentenced
 to pay the private complainant AAA the amount of P50,000.00 
as civil indemnity 
ex-delicto
 plus the amount of P50,000.00 as moral 
damages.


 SO ORDERED.
[3]




 The prosecution established the following facts:
 On May 31,
 1997 at around 9:00 in the morning, private complainant and her 5-year 
old son, 
Marcial Solar
, went to their farm about 200 meters away from 
their house at Sta. Barbara, Piat, Cagayan to gather 
camote
 tops. On 
their way to the farm, accused-appellant appeared and grabbed private 
complainant from behind. He turned her around and embraced her. Private 
complainant fought back but accused-appellant was too strong for her. He
 hit her stomach causing her to fall on the ground. He undressed then 
lay on top of her and removed her shorts and panties. He inserted his 
penis into her vagina. She struggled but to no avail. All the while her 
son was on the side shouting. After he satisfied his lust, 
accused-appellant ran away. Private complainant likewise ran towards the
 house of 
barangay
 captain Ramon Soriano and reported the incident. That
 same day, she underwent medical and physical examination.
 Dr. 
Cecille C. Paragua, a resident physician at Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Piat 
District Hospital, reported the following results:
  
  Erythema at 3:00 oâclock position 
  Hymenal Laceration at 3:00, 5:00-8:00 & 11:00 oâclock 
position, old 
  Vaginal Smear (+) sperm.
[4]


 In his defense, accused-appellant admits that he embraced and 
kissed the private complainant but denies having carnal knowledge of 
her. He recalled that on May 31, 1997, at around 9:00 in the morning, he
 saw her and 
Marcial
, her son, walking near the river bank. He 
approached her and tried to embrace and kiss her but she resisted. He 
then noticed that 
Marcial
 was crying, so he stopped and went home. Later
 that day, he was surprised when one of the 
barangay
 councilmen went to 
their house and informed his father that AAA had charged him 
with rape.
 In his Brief, accused-appellant raises the following 
assignment of errors:
  


 I 


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE
 FACT THAT HIS GUILT WAS NOT PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.




 II 
  


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT ON THE 
BASIS OF THE INCONSISTENT AND CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS OF THE WITNESSES 
FOR THE PROSECUTION.
    




 Rape is a serious offense with grave consequences both for the 
appellant and the complainant, hence the review of a judgment of 
conviction for rape must be done with utmost care.
[5]
 In reviewing rape cases, we are guided with 
three settled principles, namely: (a) An accusation for rape can be made
 with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the 
accused, though innocent, to disprove the same; (b) In view of the 
intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually
 involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with 
extreme caution; and (c) The evidence for the prosecution must stand or 
fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the 
weakness of the evidence for the defense.
[6]
 Challenging the evidence of the prosecution, 
accused-appellant claims that although he embraced and kissed the 
private complainant he did not have carnal knowledge of her. He further 
contends that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt for 
failure of the prosecution to prove the element of force or 
intimidation. He argued that the trial court erred in basing its 
judgment on the contradictory and inconsistent testimonies of the 
prosecution witnesses. Moreover, a careful reading of the testimony of 

Marcial
 shows that there was no force employed upon the private 
complainant. Private complainantâs testimony that she was hit on her 
stomach by accused-appellant does not appear in her affidavit. Lastly, 
the trial courtâs finding that he was armed with a bolo is not supported
 by the evidence on record.
 Accused-appellantâs arguments entail a
 re-examination of the credibility of the witnesses. The task of 
determining the truth between the conflicting claims belongs to the 
trial court, which had the unique opportunity to meet the witnesses face
 to face and observe their demeanor on the stand. Hence, great reliance 
is placed by appellate courts on the assessment made by the trial court 
on the credibility of the witnesses.
[7]

 We find no reason to depart from the findings of facts of the trial 
court.
 The trial court found that the private complainantâs 
testimony was clear, sincere, positive and credible,
[8]
 and that she had no reason to falsely charge 
accused-appellant of rape.

She testified as follows:

 I felt the penetration.
[10]








The ordeal of the private complainant in the hands of 
accused-appellant was rendered even more revolting since it was done in 
the presence of her 5-year old son. 
Marcial Solar
 testified as follows:








Q.


Do you remember one time your mother brought you
 along when she went to gather 
camote
 tops?

 Yes, sir. 






 


 






Q.

camote
 
tops? 






A.


 Yes, sir.

Q.

A.


 When we were going out of the cornfield, thatâs the time 
Rico Bagaua suddenly appeared. 






 


 






Q.


Can you still remember what your mother was doing when Rico 
Bagaua suddenly appeared?

Q.


Did Rico Bagaua do anything to your mother?

A.


His buttocks was moving, sir.
[11]








As against the foregoing testimonies, accused-appellant only raised
 the defense of denial. It is well-settled that denial, if 
unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a negative 
self-serving assertion that deserves no weight in law. Between the 
positive assertions of the prosecution witnesses and the negative 
averments of the accused, the former indisputably deserve more credence 
and are entitled to greater evidentiary weight. Thus, the categorical 
statements of the prosecution witnesses must prevail over the bare 
denials of accused-appellant.
[12]


 The alleged inconsistencies cited by accused-appellant between the
 testimonies of private complainant and her son are really minor in 
character and insufficient to cast doubt on the said witnessesâ 
credibility. Worth noting is the fact that 
Marcial Solar
 was five years 
old when the incident happened and seven years old when he testified in 
court. Considering 
Marcial
âs tender age and the trauma he went through 
after witnessing the sexual assault on her mother, he cannot be expected
 to recall every detail of the incident.
[13]
 In any event, we have time and again said that a few 
discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses 
referring to minor details and not actually touching upon the central 
fact of the crime do not impair the credibility of the witnesses. 
Instead of weakening their testimonies, such inconsistencies tend to 
strengthen their credibility because they discount the possibility of 
their being rehearsed.
[14]

 As regards the alleged inconsistencies between private complainantâs 
testimony and her sworn statement, we held in 
People v. Villadares
[15]
 that these inconsistencies do
 not impair the witnessâ credibility as affidavits are taken 
ex parte

 and are often incomplete or inaccurate for lack of or absence of 
searching inquiries by the investigating officer.
 Losing no time,
 private complainant reported the incident to the 
barangay
 captain and 
the police authorities; submitted herself to physical and medical 
examination; and pursued zealously the case against the 
accused-appellant. Settled is the rule that no woman would openly admit 
that she was raped and consequently subject herself to an examination of
 her private parts, undergo the trauma and humiliation of a public 
trial, and embarrass herself with the need to narrate in detail how she 
was raped, if she was not raped at all.
[16]
 Equally settled is the principle that when a woman says 
that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to 
show that rape has been inflicted on her.
[17]
 Accused-appellant also contends that the findings
 of the medical doctor who examined the private complainant do not prove
 that there was rape. To be sure, a medical examination, standing alone,
 is not sufficient to prove nor disprove the fact of rape
[18]
 because it is merely 
corroborative in character and is not an essential element of rape.
[19]
 Contrary to 
accused-appellantâs contention, Dr. Cecille C. Paraguaâs medical 
findings corroborated private complainantâs claim that she was sexually 
violated by accused-appellant. When the testimony of a rape victim is 
consistent with the medical findings, sufficient basis exists to warrant
 a conclusion that essential requisites of carnal knowledge has thereby 
been established.
[20]
 
Finally, we agree with the accused-appellant that the trial courtâs 
finding that he was armed with a bolo was not supported by evidence on 
record. Nevertheless, his conviction of the crime charged still stands 
as the prosecution has sufficiently established his guilt with moral 
certainty.
 Anent the award of damages, the trial court correctly 
awarded the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as 
moral damages. Civil indemnity is mandatory upon the finding of the fact
 of rape; it is distinct from and should not be denominated as moral 
damages which are based on different jural foundations and assessed by 
the court in the exercise of sound discretion.
[21]
 
WHEREFORE
, in view of the 
foregoing, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Tuao, Cagayan, 
Branch 11, in Criminal Case No. 646-T, finding accused-appellant Rico 
Bagaua guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and 
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua 
and to
 pay the private complainant AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as 
civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages, is
