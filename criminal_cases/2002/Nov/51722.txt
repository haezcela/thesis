[3]


Criminal Case No. 95-7582:


That on or about the 12
th
 day of May 1994, in Pasay
City, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named accused defrauded and deceived private Complainant Norma
Abagat in the following manner to wit: that the accused with intent to defraud
and well-knowing that her account with the bank has no sufficient funds,
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously make out and issue to the private
Complainant Far East Bank and Trust Company Check No. 03A058532P postdated June
10, 1994 in the amount of P150,000.00 simultaneous with, for and in
consideration of cash money from private Complainant in the total amount of
P150,000.00 but which check when presented to the drawee bank on maturity date
was promptly dishonored for reason of âDrawn Against Insufficient Fundsâ (DAIF)
and notwithstanding demands on her, accused failed and refused and still fails
and refuses to redeem or make good the said check or its value, to the damage
and prejudice of the private Complainant in the total aforesaid amount of
P150,000.00.


Contrary to Law.
[4]


Inasmuch as the three cases are interrelated, involving the same
parties and similar causes of action, they were consolidated.


On October 18, 1995 appellant was arraigned, and with the
assistance of counsel, pleaded not guilty.  A joint trial on the merits ensued thereafter.


The prosecution presented complaining witnesses, Rodrigo Abagat
and Norma David Abagat.


RODRIGO ABAGAT testified that he is engaged in the business of
supplying dry goods, such as materials for building construction as well as
communication parts, to the Philippine Air Force.  In the morning of May 10, 1994, he narrated that he was at the
Villamor Airbase together with his wife, Norma David Abagat, and appellant Rica
Cuyugan.  He and his wife met with
appellant at the Villamor Golf Club to discuss the matter of appellantâs dire
need for money on account of the supplies she wanted to buy for the Philippine
Armed Forces.
[5]

He said that they gave appellant, on staggered basis, the amount totaling to 
P
855,000.  They agreed to give her the amount provided
that appellant would issue checks to cover the value of the money given her.
[6]


When the checks were presented for payment, they were all
dishonored either on account of DAIF (drawn against insufficient funds) or for
reason of ACCOUNT CLOSED.
[7]

He forthwith informed appellant of the dishonor of the checks by sending her a
demand letter on January 12, 1995.
[8]

Despite repeated demands, appellant failed to make good the checks, which
constrained the Abagat spouses to file in May 1995 a complaint for estafa against
appellant.  It was only then that they
filed the complaint as they gave appellant an opportunity to settle her
obligations to no avail.
[9]


On cross-examination, Rodrigo admitted that appellant is a family
friend and is in fact related by affinity to his wife.  He likewise admitted that he received from
appellant the sum of 
P
100,000 applied against the check drawn in his
favor.
[10]


NORMA DAVID ABAGAT substantially corroborated the testimony of
her husband.  She accompanied her
husband when he met with appellant and witnessed the exchange of money and
checks between them.


On cross-examination Norma admitted that the checks issued by
appellant were mere guarantees for the return of their money.
[11]


The defense presented appellant RICA G. CUYUGAN.  She testified that she is a businesswoman
who furnished the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) with office supplies,
construction materials, and signal and communication spare parts.  She had been engaged in this business since
1977.  She affirmed that her husband is
the cousin of private complainant Norma Abagat.
[12]


Appellant stated that it was Norma Abagat who requested that the
Abagats participate in the big supply project for the Philippine Army.  The Abagat spouses gave her 
P
150,000
which represented the 
P
135,000 principal as partner for that
construction project with the Philippine Army and the remaining 
P
15,000
representing the 10% profit share.
[13]

In return, she issued a postdated check covering the 
P
150,000 as proof
that the Abagat spouses had invested their money with her.
[14]


She claimed that she was the industrial partner as she did all
the legwork in getting the projects.  They then shared in the profits after deducting all the miscellaneous
expenses.


She issued another postdated check worth 
P
360,000 in
exchange for the 
P
270,000 that Norma Abagat gave her, less expenses and
profit share.  She also issued another
check for 
P
36,000 representing interest for four months at 
P
9,000
per month.
[15]

On account of another deal she closed with the Philippine Army, she issued to
Norma another check worth 
P
300,000 as the latterâs share in said deal,
and a check worth 
P
9,000 as interest for the former.
[16]


Appellant made payments to the Abagat spouses by depositing the
total amount of 
P
575,000 in the latterâs bank account with Maybank (formerly
Philippine Republic Bank).
[17]


She further testified on cross-examination that when the checks
bounced, she issued four replacement checks in the sala of the trial judge but
these checks also bounced.
[18]


ADELARDO GUEVARRA, bank account analyst at Maybank Philippines,
Villamor Airbase branch, testified that as part of his duties and functions he
posted and recorded deposit accounts and withdrawals.
[19]

He claimed to be familiar with the Maybank account of Rodrigo Abagat and that
deposits were made in said account but he had no knowledge who deposited these
amounts.
[20]


LT. COL. RAMOS L. AQUINO, Logistics Supply Officer of the
Philippine Army, was the final witness for the defense.  He testified that he knew appellant quite
well and the latter had introduced him to Norma Abagat who owned NDA
Trading.  He also affirmed that
appellant dealt with the Philippine Army in supplying it with materials for
certain projects.
[21]


The trial court found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
estafa committed by means of false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior
to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud, that is by postdating a
check or issuing a check in payment of an obligation when the offender had no
funds in the bank, or his funds deposited therein were not sufficient to cover
the amount of the check.
[22]


Hence this appeal where appellant assigns the lone error that:


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED
APPELLANT RICA G. CUYUGAN GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THREE (3) COUNTS OF
ESTAFA.


The issue is whether the trial court erred in convicting
appellant for three counts of estafa and sentencing her pursuant to Article
315, 2 (d) of the Revised Penal Code as amended by P.D. No. 818.


Appellant contends that the agreement entered into by her and the
Abagat spouses was for a partnership transaction for the supply of materials
for the Armed Forces.  She further
asserts that the Abagat spouses had known her for a long time and had previous
business dealings with her.  It was
actually on account of her good credit standing that they were convinced to
become her partners.  She issued the
subject checks as mere guarantees, according to appellant, hence they were
postdated.


Incidentally, appellant also assails the penalty imposed by the
trial court on the ground that it violates the constitutional provision on
cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment.  Considering that this appeal could be decided on other grounds, however,
we need not now pursue the issue of unconstitutionality of P.D. No. 818, which
amended Article 315, 2 (d) of the Revised Penal Code, as earlier amended by
R.A. No. 4885.


For the appellee, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG)
states that although appellant incurred criminal liability, she should only be
penalized for violation of BP 22 and not for estafa because the prosecution
failed to establish fraud.  According to
the OSG, contrary to appellantâs claim that the sum of 
P
855,000 given to
her by the Abagat spouses represented the latterâs investment in a supposed
partnership, the evidence clearly established that the 
P
855,000 was a
loan extended by the spouses to appellant.  However, the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt fraud
or bad faith on the part of appellant in issuing the postdated checks.


We find the appeal meritorious.


Generally, findings and conclusion of the trial court are binding
upon us in the absence of a clear showing of arbitrariness or palpable error
[23]

or unless it has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that,
if considered, might affect the result of the case.
[24]


We agree with the OSG that the prosecution failed to discharge
its burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the offense of estafa as
defined by the Revised Penal Code in Article 315, 2 (d), was committed by the
appellant.  More particularly, the
prosecution did not prove the existence of fraud to constitute the issuance of
the check as fraud contemplated by the law on estafa.  As we previously held:


To constitute estafa under this provision the act of postdating or
issuing a check in payment of an obligation must be the efficient cause of
defraudation, and as such it should be either prior to, or simultaneous with
the act of fraud.  The offender must be
able to obtain money or property from the offended party because of the issuance
of a check whether postdated or not.  That is, the latter would not have parted with his money or other
property were it not for the issuance of the check.
[25]


In this case, the trial court failed to consider the testimonies
of both the private complainants with respect to the agreement that the checks
issued by appellant shall be mere guarantees for the eventual payment of the
money given to appellant.


As aptly pointed out by the OSG, Norma Abagat admitted on
cross-examination that the checks that appellant issued merely guaranteed the
payment of the loan.
[26]

Rodrigo Abagat likewise admitted as much and even testified on
cross-examination that he intended to impose a monthly interest at the rate of
5% on the amount lent.
[27]

The OSG observed that it was not the issuance of the checks that prompted the
Abagat spouses to part with their money but rather, the liberality to help
appellant who is the wife of Normaâs cousin, as well as the expectation to
collect interest payment for the loan extended to appellant.


The transaction between appellant and the Abagat spouses, in our
view, was one for a loan of money to be used by appellant in her business and
she issued checks to guarantee the payment of the loan.  As such, she has the obligation to make good
the payment of the money borrowed by her.  But such obligation is civil in character and in the absence of fraud,
no criminal liability under the Revised Penal Code arises from the mere
issuance of postdated checks as a guarantee of repayment.  We find appellantâs allegation, that the
Abagat spouses entered into a joint venture agreement with her for the supply
of materials with the AFP, is self-serving.  But we also note that the trial court convicted appellant on a general
allegation that all the elements of estafa under Article 315, 2 (d) of the
Revised Penal Code had been proved by the prosecution without making any
reference to or giving any proof of the actual fraud that appellant allegedly
committed to make her liable for estafa.  It is elementary that where an allegation in the information is an
essential element of the crime, the same must be proved beyond reasonable doubt
to sustain a conviction.  In this case,
the prosecution did not establish specifically and conclusively the fraud
alleged as an element of the offenses charged.


Considering that the informations against appellant involved
violation of Art. 315, 2 (d) of the Revised Penal Code, we take exception to
the OSGâs recommendation
[28]

that appellant should be held liable for violations of BP 22.  Appellant cannot be convicted of a crime for
which she was not properly charged, for that would violate appellantâs
constitutional right to be informed of the accusation against her.
[29]

The purpose of the constitutional guarantee that a person accused of an offense
be informed of the accusation against him is (a) to furnish the accused with
such a description of the charge against him as will enable him to make his
defense; (b) to avail himself of his conviction or acquittal, for protection
against a further prosecution for the same cause; and (c) to inform the court
of the facts alleged, so that it may decide whether they are sufficient in law
to support a conviction, if one should be had.
[30]


The informations filed with the regional trial court were for
three counts of estafa.  Earlier, the
informations for BP 22 covering the same checks filed with the Metropolitan
Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 44, were provisionally dismissed on November
13, 1996.
[31]

These cases were not re-filed nor consolidated with the informations for estafa
before the RTC of Pasay.  Accordingly,
appellant was never apprised of the fact that she may still be held liable for
BP 22 and so never had an opportunity to defend herself against an accusation
for an offense under the special law.  BP 22 cannot be deemed necessarily included in the crime of estafa under
RPC, Article 315, 2 (d).  The offense of
fraud defined under the Revised Penal Code is 
malum in se, 
whereas BP
22, also known as Bouncing Checks Law, is a special law which punishes the
issuance of bouncing checks, a 
malum prohibitum
.  Fraud or estafa under the Revised Penal Code
is a distinct offense from the violation of the Bouncing Checks Law.  They are different offenses, having
different elements.
[32]

In this case, since appellant is accused of violating a particular provision of
the Revised Penal Code on estafa, she may not be convicted for violation of BP
22 without trenching on fundamental fairness.


The trial court found sufficient evidence that appellant already
paid the amount of 
P
425,000 out of her total indebtedness of 
P
855,000.  Apparently, appellant made a belated effort
to make good her obligation.  Be that as
it may, there is a remaining balance of her obligation in the amount of 
P
430,000
as the difference between 
P
855,000 less 
P
425,000.  This amount of 
P
430,000 should be
paid by appellant as a just obligation owing to the spouses Rodrigo and Norma
Abagat.  In addition, interest of 12
percent per annum, to be computed in accordance with Article 1169,
[33]

should also be paid by her.  For where
the debtor incurs in delay, he has to pay interest by way of damages, in
conformity with our ruling in 
Eastern
Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals
.
[34]


WHEREFORE

judgment dated December 20, 2000, of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City,
Branch 117, in Criminal Cases Nos. 95-7580, 95-7581, and 95-7582 finding
