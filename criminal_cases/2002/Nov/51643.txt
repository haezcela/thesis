VIRGIE SERONA, PETITIONER, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


During the period from July 1992 to September 1992, Leonida
Quilatan delivered pieces of jewelry to petitioner Virgie Serona to be sold on
commission basis. By oral agreement of the parties, petitioner shall remit
payment or return the pieces of jewelry if not sold to Quilatan, both within 30
days from receipt of the items.


Upon petitionerâs failure to pay on September 24, 1992, Quilatan
required her to execute an acknowledgment receipt (Exhibit B) indicating their
agreement and the total amount due, to wit:


Ako, si Virginia Serona, nakatira sa Mother Earth Subd., Las Pinas,
ay kumuha ng mga alahas kay Gng. Leonida Quilatan na may kabuohang halaga na
P567,750.00 para ipagbili para ako magkakomisyon at ibibigay ang benta kung
mabibili o ibabalik sa kanya ang mga nasabing alahas kung hindi mabibili sa
loob ng 30 araw.


Las Pinas, September 24, 1992.
[1]


The receipt was signed by petitioner and a witness, Rufina G.
Navarette.


Unknown to Quilatan, petitioner had earlier entrusted the jewelry
to one Marichu Labrador for the latter to sell on commission basis.  Petitioner was not able to collect payment
from Labrador, which caused her to likewise fail to pay her obligation to
Quilatan.


Subsequently, Quilatan, through counsel, sent a formal letter of
demand
[2]

to petitioner for failure to settle her obligation.  Quilatan executed a complaint affidavit
[3]

against petitioner before the Office of the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor.
Thereafter, an information for 
estafa

under Article 315, paragraph 1(b)
[4]
 of
the Revised Penal Code was filed against petitioner, which was raffled to
Branch 255 of the Regional Trial Court of Las Pinas. The information alleged:


That on or about and sometime during the period from July 1992 up
to September 1992, in the Municipality of Las Pinas, Metro Manila, Philippines,
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused received
in trust from the complainant Leonida E. Quilatan various pieces of jewelry in
the total value of P567,750.00 to be sold on commission basis under the express
duty and obligation of remitting the proceeds thereof to the said complainant
if sold or returning the same to the latter if unsold but the said accused once
in possession of said various pieces of jewelry, with unfaithfulness and abuse
of confidence and with intent to defraud, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously misappropriate and convert the same for her own
personal use and benefit and despite oral and written demands, she failed and
refused to account for said jewelry or the proceeds of sale thereof, to the
damage and prejudice of complainant Leonida E. Quilatan in the aforestated
total amount of P567,750.00.


CONTRARY TO LAW.
[5]


Petitioner pleaded not guilty to the charge upon arraignment.
[6]
  Trial on the merits thereafter ensued.


Quilatan testified that petitioner was able to remit P100,000.00
and returned P43,000.00 worth of jewelriy;
[7]
 that
at the start, petitioner was prompt in settling her obligation; however,
subsequently the payments were remitted late;
[8]
 that
petitioner still owed her in the amount of P424,750.00.
[9]


On the other hand, petitioner admitted that she received several
pieces of jewelry from Quilatan and that she indeed failed to pay for the same.
She claimed that she entrusted the pieces of jewelry to Marichu Labrador who
failed to pay for the same, thereby causing her to default in paying Quilatan.
[10]

She presented handwritten receipts (Exhibits 1 & 2)
[11]

evidencing payments made to Quilatan prior to the filing of the criminal case.


Marichu Labrador confirmed that she received pieces of jewelry
from petitioner worth P441,035.00.  She
identified an acknowledgment receipt (Exhibit 3)
[12]

signed by her dated July 5, 1992 and testified that she sold the jewelry to a
person who absconded without paying her.  Labrador also explained that in the past, she too had directly
transacted with Quilatan for the sale of jewelry on commission basis; however,
due to her outstanding account with the latter, she got jewelry from petitioner
instead.
[13]


On November 17, 1994, the trial court rendered a decision finding
petitioner guilty of 
estafa
, the
dispositive portion of which reads:


WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the court finds the
accused Virgie Serona guilty beyond reasonable doubt, and as the amount
misappropriated is P424,750.00 the penalty provided under the first paragraph
of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code has to be imposed which shall be in
the maximum period plus one (1) year for every additional P10,000.00.


Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the said accused is hereby
sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment ranging from FOUR (4) YEARS and
ONE (1) DAY of 
prision correccional

as minimum to TEN (10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of 
prision mayor
 as maximum; to pay the sum of P424,750.00 as cost for
the unreturned jewelries; to suffer the accessory penalties provided by law;
and to pay the costs.


SO ORDERED.
[14]


Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the
judgment of conviction but modified the penalty as follows:


WHEREFORE, the appealed decision finding the accused-appellant
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
estafa
 is hereby AFFIRMED with
the following MODIFICATION:


Considering that the amount involved is P424,750.00, the penalty
should be imposed in its maximum period adding one (1) year for each additional
P10,000.00 albeit the total penalty should not exceed Twenty (20) Years (Art.
315). Hence, accused-appellant is hereby SENTENCED to suffer the penalty of
imprisonment ranging from Four (4) Years and One (1) Day of 
Prision Correccional as
minimum to Twenty (20) Years of Reclusion
Temporal
.


SO ORDERED.
[15]


Upon denial of her motion for reconsideration,
[16]

petitioner filed the instant petition under Rule 45, alleging that:


I


RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT
THERE WAS AN ABUSE OF CONFIDENCE ON THE PART OF PETITIONER IN ENTRUSTING THE
SUBJECT JEWELRIES 
(sic)
 TO HER
SUB-AGENT FOR SALE ON COMMISSION TO PROSPECTIVE BUYERS.


II


RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT
THERE WAS MISAPPROPRIATION OR CONVERSION ON THE PART OF PETITIONER WHEN SHE
FAILED TO RETURN THE SUBJECT JEWELRIES 
(sic)
 TO PRIVATE COMPLAINANT.
[17]


Petitioner argues that the prosecution failed to establish the
elements of 
estafa
 as penalized under
Article 315, par. 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code. In particular, she submits
that she neither abused the confidence reposed upon her by Quilatan nor
converted or misappropriated the subject jewelry; that her giving the pieces of
jewelry to a sub-agent for sale on commission basis did not violate her
undertaking with Quilatan.  Moreover,
petitioner delivered the jewelry to Labrador under the same terms upon which it
was originally entrusted to her.  It was
established that petitioner had not derived any personal benefit from the loss
of the jewelry. Consequently, it cannot be said that she misappropriated or
converted the same.


We find merit in the petition.


The elements of 
estafa
 through
misappropriation or conversion as defined in Article 315, par. 1(b) of the
Revised Penal Code are: (1) that the money, good or other personal property is
received by the offender in trust, or on commission, or for administration, or
under any other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of, or to
return, the same; (2) that there be misappropriation or conversion of such
money or property by the offender or denial on his part of such receipt; (3)
that such misappropriation or conversion or denial is to the prejudice of another;
and (4) that there is a demand made by the offended party on the offender.
[18]

While the first, third and fourth elements are concededly present, we find the
second element of misappropriation or conversion to be lacking in the case at
bar.


Petitioner did not 
ipso
facto
 commit the crime of 
estafa

through conversion or misappropriation by delivering the jewelry to a sub-agent
for sale on commission basis. We are unable to agree with the lower courtsâ
conclusion that this fact alone is sufficient ground for holding that
petitioner disposed of the jewelry âas if it were hers, thereby committing
conversion and a clear breach of trust.â
[19]


It must be pointed out that the law on agency in our jurisdiction
allows the appointment by an agent of a substitute or sub-agent in the absence
of an express agreement to the contrary between the agent and the principal.
[20]

In the case at bar, the appointment of Labrador as petitionerâs sub-agent was
not expressly prohibited by Quilatan, as the acknowledgment receipt, Exhibit B,
does not contain any such limitation. Neither does it appear that petitioner
was verbally forbidden by Quilatan from passing on the jewelry to another
person before the acknowledgment receipt was executed or at any other time.
Thus, it cannot be said that petitionerâs act of entrusting the jewelry to
Labrador is characterized by abuse of confidence because such an act was not
proscribed and is, in fact, legally sanctioned.


The essence of 
estafa

under Article 315, par. 1(b) is the appropriation or conversion of money or
property received to the prejudice of the owner. The words âconvertâ and
âmisappropriatedâ connote an act of using or disposing of anotherâs property as
if it were oneâs own, or of devoting it to a purpose or use different from that
agreed upon. To misappropriate for oneâs own use includes not only conversion
to oneâs personal advantage, but also every attempt to dispose of the property
of another without right.
[21]


In the case at bar, it was established that the inability of
petitioner as agent to comply with her duty to return either the pieces of
jewelry or the proceeds of its sale to her principal Quilatan was due, in turn,
to the failure of Labrador to abide by her agreement with petitioner. Notably,
Labrador testified that she obligated herself to sell the jewelry in behalf of
petitioner also on commission basis or to return the same if not sold. In other
words, the pieces of jewelry were given by petitioner to Labrador to achieve
the very same end for which they were delivered to her in the first place.
Consequently, there is no conversion since the pieces of jewelry were not
devoted to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon.


Similarly, it cannot be said that petitioner misappropriated the
jewelry or delivered them to Labrador âwithout right.â Aside from the fact that
no condition or limitation was imposed on the mode or manner by which
petitioner was to effect the sale, it is also consistent with usual practice
for the seller to necessarily part with the valuables in order to find a buyer
and allow inspection of the items for sale.


In 
People v. Nepomuceno
,
[22]

the accused-appellant was acquitted of 
estafa

on facts similar to the instant case. Accused-appellant therein undertook to
sell two diamond rings in behalf of the complainant on commission basis, with
the obligation to return the same in a few days if not sold. However, by reason
of the fact that the rings were delivered also for sale on commission to
sub-agents who failed to account for the rings or the proceeds of its sale,
accused-appellant likewise failed to make good his obligation to the
complainant thereby giving rise to the charge of 
estafa
. In absolving the accused-appellant of the crime charged, we
held:


Where, as in the present case, the agents to whom personal property
was entrusted for sale, conclusively proves the inability to return the same is
solely due to malfeasance of a sub-agent to whom the first agent had actually
entrusted the property in good faith, and for the same purpose for which it was
received; there being no prohibition to do so and the chattel being delivered
to the sub-agent before the owner demands its return or before such return
becomes due, we hold that the first agent can not be held guilty of 
estafa
 by
either misappropriation or conversion. The abuse of confidence that is
characteristic of this offense is missing under the circumstances.
[23]


Accordingly, petitioner herein must be acquitted. The lower
courtsâ reliance on 
People v. Flores
[24]
 and 
U.S.
v. Panes
[25]
 to justify petitionerâs conviction is
misplaced, considering that the
factual background of the cited cases differ from those which obtain in the
case at bar. In 
Flores
, the accused
received a ring to sell 
under the
condition that she would return it the following day if not sold
 and
without authority to retain the ring or to give it to a sub-agent. The accused
in 
Panes,
 meanwhile, was obliged to
return the jewelry he received 
upon
demand
, but passed on the same to a sub-agent 
even after demand for its return had already been made
. In the foregoing
cases, it was held that there was conversion or misappropriation.


Furthermore, in 
Lim v.
Court of Appeals
,
[26]
 the
Court, citing 
Nepomuceno
 and the case
of 
People v. Trinidad
,
[27]

held that:


In cases of 
estafa
 the profit or gain must be obtained by the
accused 
personally
, through his own acts, 
and his mere negligence in permitting
another to take advantage or benefit from the entrusted chattel cannot
constitute estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1-b, of the Revised Penal Code
;
unless of course the evidence should disclose that the agent acted in
conspiracy or connivance with the one who carried out the actual
misappropriation, then the accused would be answerable for the acts of his
co-conspirators. 
If there is no such evidence, direct or circumstantial, and if
the proof is clear that the accused herself was the innocent victim of her
sub-agentâs faithlessness, her acquittal is in order
.
[28]

(Italics supplied) 


Labrador admitted that she received the jewelry from petitioner
and sold the same to a third person. She further acknowledged that she owed
petitioner P441,035.00, thereby negating any criminal intent on the part of
petitioner.  There is no showing that
petitioner derived personal benefit from or conspired with Labrador to deprive
Quilatan of the jewelry or its value. Consequently, there is no 
estafa
 within contemplation of the law.


Notwithstanding the above, however, petitioner is not entirely
free from any liability towards Quilatan. The rule is that an accused acquitted
of 
estafa
 may nevertheless be held
civilly liable where the facts established by the evidence so warrant. Then
too, an agent who is not prohibited from appointing a sub-agent but does so
without express authority is responsible for the acts of the sub-agent.
[29]

Considering that the civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising
from the offense is deemed instituted with the criminal action,
[30]

petitioner is liable to pay complainant Quilatan the value of the unpaid pieces
of jewelry.


WHEREFORE
, the
petition is 
GRANTED
.  The decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. CR No. 17222 dated April 30,1997 and its resolution dated August 28,
1997 are 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. Petitioner Virgie Serona is 
ACQUITTED
 of the crime charged, but is
held civilly liable in the amount of P424,750.00 as actual damages, plus legal
interest, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.


SO ORDERED.
