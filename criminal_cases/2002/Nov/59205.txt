The indictees, when arraigned, pled ânot guiltyâ to all the charges. The cases were tried jointly.
The Version of the Prosecution -
Marie Flamiano was a waitress at âSabungan Fastfood and Videoke Pub,â located along Samson Road, in Caloocan City. At about one-thirty on the morning of 28 July 1999, she was attending to customers when seven men, she identified to be Diosdado Recepcion, Alfredo Baracas, Joemari delos Reyes, Bernardo Ranara, Dominador Recepcion, Robert Alfonso and Audie Dona, entered the pub while one was tailing behind at the entrance. The men occupied table 12 and ordered beer from waitress Eliza Bautista. A few minutes later, three men from the group transferred to table 10. Just as Marie was approaching table 13 to get the microphone from a customer, one of the men stood up and fired his gun at another customer. Marie identified this gunman to be Alfredo Baracas.
Eliza Bautista, the waitress who served the group, among them Diosdado Recepcion, Robert Alfonso, Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Eduardo Palacpac, Joemari delos Reyes and Dominador Recepcion, saw another man pull out a gun and shot a customer, Rodolfo Ortega, while on his knees. The women later identified the gunman to be Diosdado Recepcion. Rosalia Juanica, a co-waitress who had meanwhile dashed out and hid at the nearby âSt. Joseph Store,â saw Rodolfo Ortega, kneeling with both hands raised in plea, but one of the men, she likewise identified to be Diosdado Recepcion, fired his gun at pointblank range.
Jojo Paraiso was with his co-security guards having a drinking spree when a group of armed men, started shooting. Some of the men shouted, âdapa,â but Jojoâs companion, Benjamin Valdez, unfortunately took a bullet shot before he could get the chance to heed the warning. Jojo identified the person who fired at Valdez to be Robert Alfonso. He hid under the table and could only watch the men gone berserk. The last of the gunmen who left the pub, still firing his gun, was Joemari delos Reyes.
Jhosa Reyes, a waitress at the A & E Kitchenette just across the Sabungan, saw the gunmen and their cohorts scamper away after the shooting incident. She recognized three of the gunmen, Robert Alfonso, Joemari delos Reyes and Eduardo Palacpac, as being âregularâ customers at the A & E Kitchenette. Shortly before the shooting, Alfonso, delos Reyes, Palacpac and another companion were drinking at the kitchenette but soon headed towards the alley near the pub.
Found sprawled on the floor, when the shooting finally stopped, were the lifeless bodies of five men - Benjamin Valdez, Augusto Billodo, Renato Cleofas, Rodolfo Ortega and Ruperto San Juan.
Ruben Labjata, a jeepney driver, was waiting for passengers at Dagohoy Street, Caloocan City, when he heard gunshots. He was about to leave with only a few passengers when, unexpectedly, three men arrived and ordered all the passengers to get off the vehicle. The men menacingly pointed their guns at Labjata and ordered him to drive. Moments later, five more men boarded his jeepney. Three of the men stayed with the driver at the front seat while the other five sat at the rear. The group directed Labjata to drive towards Monumento and then to EDSA. After stopping briefly at Petron Station to refuel, the group proceeded to Quezon City. At a â7-11â convenience store in Tandang Sora, some of the men alighted from the vehicle. More gunshots were fired. Boarding once again the jeepney, the men told Labjata to go north until they finally reached, hours later, Paniqui, Tarlac. At Paniqui, the men debated on the driverâs fate. After hearing one suggest that he should be killed (âtumbaâ), Labjata panicked and begged the group to spare him -âmaawa po kayo, may pamilya po ako.â One of the men allowed him to go home with a warning that he should not report the incident to the police. In open court, he identified the malefactors to be Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Diosdado Recepcion, Bernardo Ranara, Eduardo Palacpac, Dominador Recepcion, Joemari delos Reyes and Robert Alfonso.
Conrado Marquez, a tricycle driver, was waiting for passengers along the highway of Paniqui, Tarlac, when he saw a group of men alight from a dirty jeepney. Four of the men rode in his tricycle, while the other four took two more tricycles. Marquez brought the group to Brgy. Coral, Ramos, Tarlac.
Around lunchtime on 29 July 1999, the Bulacan Police invited Ruben Labjata for questioning. Taken by police authorities to Tarlac, he pointed to the exact place where the armed men got off from his vehicle. Conrado Marquez, likewise invited by the police for interrogation, readily informed the police of the place where he brought the men who hired his tricycle. The police promptly cordoned the area and the group, along with FO1 Felipe dela Cruz, surrendered after several calls by the police. Taken into custody were Felipe dela Cruz, Joemari delos Reyes, Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Eduardo Palacpac, Bernardo Ranara, Robert Alfonso, and Dominador Recepcion. Diosdado Recepcion, then a special agent of the Narcotics Command, was intercepted at the national highway of Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija, on board a tricycle. At the Tarlac Police Station, Labjata identified his passengers, namely, Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Diosdado Recepcion, Bernardo Ranara, Eduardo Palacpac, Dominador Recepcion, Joemari delos Reyes and Robert Alfonso.
Diosdado Recepcion, Felipe dela Cruz, Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Eduardo Palacpac, Bernardo Ranara, Joemari delos Reyes, Dominador Recepcion, and Roberto Alfonso were charged with multiple murder, violation of P.D. No. 1866, and robbery in band before the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Region, Branch 129, Caloocan City. The incident that occurred at the 7-11 convenience store also spawned several separate criminal informations (not involved in the instant cases under review).
During the trial, Diosdado Recepcion died in an escape attempt, while accused Bernardo Ranara escaped and remained at large.
The Version of the Defense
The defense interposed 
alibi.
According to Dominador Recepcion, he was, at the time of the reported shooting incident, fast asleep at Greenwoods Subdivision in Cainta, Rizal, where he was a construction worker. His co-workers were Eduardo Palacpac and Robert Alfonso. On the evening of 27 July 1999, the trio went to Pansi, Paniqui, Tarlac, to help Dominador Recepcionâs nephew, Joemari delos Reyes, find a job. It was after one oâclock in the afternoon when Joemari brought them to the house of his cousin FO1 Felipe dela Cruz.
Joemari delos Reyes testified that, on the afternoon of 28 July 1999, he was at home when his uncle Dominador Recepcion arrived with Robert Alfonso and Eduardo Palacpac. He brought his guests to the house of Felipe dela Cruz where they partook of beer.
Felipe dela Cruz stated that on 28 July 1999, about one oâclock in the afternoon, his father fetched him from a cousinâs house. When he arrived home, he was met by Joemari delos Reyes along with the latterâs companions, namely, Eduardo Palacpac, Robert Alfonso, and Dominador Recepcion. In the evening of the same day, about eight oâclock, he invited his visitors to join him in attending a wake just a few meters away, and they stayed there until dawn. The following morning of 29 July 1999, policemen arrived and cordoned his house. He was arrested together with Joemari delos Reyes, Audie Dona and Alfredo Baracas. During a series of questioning at the Caloocan Police Station, dela Cruz insisted that he was attending a wake at the time the shooting incident occurred in Caloocan City.
Audie Dona said that on 28 July 1999, he and his friend Alfredo Baracas, went to Pansi, Ramos, Tarlac, to visit his cousin Joemari delos Reyes and to get some fresh fish and vegetables. When he did not find Joemari at his house, he and Baracas proceeded to the place of dela Cruz where they were invited to join the group of Felipe dela Cruz, Joemari delos Reyes, Eduardo Palacpac, and Dominador Recepcion in a drinking spree. Dona and Baracas stayed until nine oâclock in the evening when they repaired to the house of Joemari to spend the night. On 29 July 1999, he and Baracas went back to see dela Cruz but found Joemari still sleeping. The two dozed off while waiting for Joemari to wake up until they all found themselves surrounded by the police.
When the trial was over and weighing the evidence before it, the court 
a quo
 found the several accused guilty in Criminal Case No. C-57208 for multiple murder but acquitted them in Criminal Case No. C-57209 for the charge of illegal possession of firearm and Criminal Case No. 57210 for robbery in band because of insufficiency of evidence.  The trial court adjudged thusly:
âWHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court finds the following accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Multiple Murder in Criminal Case No. C-57208, as defined and penalized under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 6 of Rep. Act No. 7659:

2.            Alfredo Baracas
3.            Bernardo Ranara (escaped)
4.            Eduardo Palacpac
5.            Dominador Recepcion
6.            Joemari delos Reyes
7.            Robert Alfonso
âAccordingly, the 7 above-named accused shall each serve the penalty of

[6]
The capital punishment having been imposed on herein appellants for the crime of multiple murder, the case was elevated to this Court for automatic review. In their brief, appellants ascribed to the trial court a number of alleged errors but, by and large, they focused on the issue of credibility of the witnesses and the imposition of the death penalty.
Appellants argue that the witnesses presented by the prosecution have committed several inconsistencies, mainly on the identities of the gunmen, said to be well enough to discredit their testimony. The poor lighting condition of the pub, they claim, could have easily blurred the vision of the witnesses frustrating any clear identification of the assailants. The defense also belabors the finding of conspiracy and, in general, of their conviction by the trial court.
In criminal cases, particularly where the capital punishment is imposed, this Court takes a most painstaking effort to ascertain the guilt or innocence of the convicted accused. Nevertheless, it has long been a standing rule that the findings on the credibility of witnesses by the trial court are hardly disturbed on appeal. The appellate court adheres to such deference in view of the vantage that a trial court enjoys in its reception of testimonial evidence, It is only when there evidently are matters of substance that have been overlooked that an appellate court would feel justified to ignore the evaluation and assessment made by the trial court on such evidence. Looking closely at the records, nothing significant is disclosed to warrant a reversal of the rule. Observe thusly -

[8]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On cross-examination, this witness elaborated:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ 
 
And what could be your basis in pointing to Diosdado Recepcion as well as to accused Alfredo Baracas and the rest, when you did not see who shot whom?
 
 
 
âA 
 
Because I saw them, sir.

âQ
 
 
In other words, when you scampered outside, you did not see with particularity the accused shooting the victim, is that correct?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
While I was running, I saw them, they were shooting the victims, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
You mean to tell me that during the time you were running outside, your head was turning back to where the accused were situated shooting?
 
 
 
âA 
 
Yes, sir. (Witness is pointing as to the direction of the door of the restaurant)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
With that distance you are pointing to, to the corner of this room, you could have not ascertain[ed] Mr. Diosdado Recepcion holding a gun and shooting at somebody, is that correct?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
I saw him, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
In fact in your testimony, you cannot identify whether it was a short gun or a long gun?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Yes, sir, I could not identify the kind of guns they were using.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
Because you became very scared, frightened and nervous that is why you scampered outside?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
And also because of that nervousness and fright that you experienced, you are in doubt whether it was really Diosdado Recepcion whom you saw?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
I saw him sir. (
Siya po
).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ 
 
That incident on July 28, 1999 was the first time that you saw this person whom you pointed as Diosdado Recepcion, is that right?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
So, how can you be very sure that it was him who was holding a gun and shooting at somebody when you said that was the first time that you saw him and your distance was quite far and likewise you cannot determine or ascertain whether he was holding a long gun or short gun?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Because I saw them standing, sir.
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
You mean to tell me that aside from Diosdado Recepcion, all the 7 accused were all standing?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Yes, sir, they were all standing.
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
And you also would like to impress before this Court that all the 7 accused were holding a gun and were all standing and were all shooting at somebody?

I am not sure but all of them stood up and shot somebody.â

On cross-examination, Paraiso continued:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
Mr. Witness, you said that the shooting incident happened at 1:30 in the early morning of July 28, 1999. What time did you start drinking at the Sabungan Restaurant?

The table completely covered me, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
Could you say that you were not shot because you were not seen by the gunman?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Yes, sir. I know that they did not notice me there under the table, sir. Maybe if they noticed me that I was there under the table looking at them, maybe they would shoot me, sir.

So, we can presume that you were not shot because you were not seen by the gunman?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

âA
 
 
No cover, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
You felt that at that time that you present yourself under the table was not detected by the gunman because none of them noticed you under the table?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
I know that I was [not] noticed by them, sir. Because they have noticed me under the table and they know that I was looking at them, they will shoot me, sir.â

Testimony of Ruben Labiata
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ 
 
Mr. Labjata, will you tell this Honorable Court where were you in the early morning of July 28, 1999?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
I was in Dagohoy with my jeepney waiting for passengers, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ 
 
More or less, what time was that when you were with your jeep and waiting for passengers?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Between twelve and one a.m., sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
Do you recall, Mr. Labjata, of any unusual incident that occurred while waiting for passengers inside your jeepney?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
While my jeep was parked there, I heard gunshots, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
What else, if any, happened?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
I was about to leave then and I have already passengers when some people suddenly arrived, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âxxx               xxx               xxx
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
Did you, if you did notice if the 3 men who ordered immediately to let your passengers get off the jeep, if they were armed?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âAtty. Ongteco
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The same objection.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âCourt
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Same ruling, you are practically telling the witness that they were armed.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âFiscal DaÃ±osos
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ 
 
Alright, while the 3 ordered you, did you notice anything, if you did any?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
They were armed with guns, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
What kind of guns, are they long arms or short arms?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Short arms, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âxxx               xxx               xxx
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
Other than the 3 were there other persons who boarded your jeep?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âAtty. Ongteco
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Same objection.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âCourt
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I will allow that.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âAtty. Ongteco
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
But that is the same banana because according to the witness, the 3 persons ordered the other passengers of the jeep to alight.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âCourt
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
That was ordering the passengers to alight. The question now is, were there other persons who boarded your jeep. I will allow that. Answer that.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âWitness
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When they told me to start the jeep, there were some persons who boarded the jeep, sir.

âQ
 
 
Can you also tell the Honorable Court briefly what was the condition of this other group who also boarded?

They were also holding guns, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
More or less, how many of them, the one[s] that boarded again?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
When I start[ed] the engine or already driving the jeep I saw 8, sir.

âQ
 
 
When you were ordered to go, what did you do, if any?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
I drove the jeep and then we made a turn near the Monumento Circle and proceeded to Edsa, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
While you were proceeding to Edsa, did you notice anything unusual again?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Yes, sir, I noticed something unusual because while they were conversing to each other, I heard somebody said that âhindi ako ang bumaril.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âxxx               xxx               xxx
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ 
 
From Petron Gas Station after you have gassed up, where did you go, if you went somewhere else?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
We proceeded to the highway and then when we wereâ already far from Petron, we made a left turn, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
In what direction was this left [turn] going towards?â
 
 
 
âA
 
 
I am not familiar with that route, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
By the way, who among the group ordered you to what direction you [were] going to?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
The one on my left side, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
At that point of time, did the group tell you where you [were] going?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
I do not know where to go but they ordered me and I followed them.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
Now, as a jeepney driver from Bulacan, can you tell the Honorable Court to what direction or route you were going?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
After making a left turn, we passed by a 711 store, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âxxx               xxx               xxx
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
While you were driving your jeep from Caloocan City to Tarlac, was there a time whether one of the group told you what to do?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Yes, sir. They poked a gun at me and told me to follow them whatever they wanted me to do, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âxxx               xxx               xxx
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
While you were so scared because you were ordered and you realized that you reached Paniqui, was there at any moment while driving your jeep that you [felt] that you might be killed by this armed men?

Did you ever feel that you might be killed? I will allow it.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âWitness
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because when we arrived [at] Tarlac, I heard one of them said âtumba.â

What did you do after hearing âtumba?â Witness may answer.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âWitness
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I told them, âSir, maawa naman po kayo.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âFiscal DaÃ±osos
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
To whom did you address your words?
 
 
 
âA 
 
I just said, âMaawa naman po kayo, huwag ninyo po akong itumba because, I have a family.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
After you told the group of the accused that, âSir, huwag naman ninyo akong itumba,â what else transpired?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
One of them said, âin behalf of your family, bubuhayin ka namin for the sake of your family. (Alang-alang sa pamilya mo).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
What else, if any, after one of them told you that for the sake of your family, we will not kill you.
 
 
 
âA
 
 
They told me that after reaching Tarlac, I will return back and without turning my head and do not report to the police or else they will shoot me.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
So, after you received those orders, what did you do, if any?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
When they alighted from the jeep, I did not look at them. Once they alighted, I proceeded or went back to Bulacan, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ 
 
You said that after hearing their orders and reaching Paniqui, Tarlac, they went down. They alighted. Did all of them alight at the same time?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
They alighted one after the other, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ 
 
After they have alighted, what else if any transpired?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
I left at a place where they alighted and then I went back to Bulacan, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âxxx               xxx               xxx

After they were arrested from their hideout, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
Where exactly did you meet them at Paniqui, Tarlac?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
At the Municipal Hall of Paniqui, Tarlac, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
 
More or less, what time was that already?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
About past eight in the morning, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ 
 
You said that at around past eight, you saw the group again who commandeered your jeep. How did you know that they were the same persons who commandeered your jeep that early morning of July 28, 1999?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Because I was able to recognize the faces of the others, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
âQ
 
Mr. Witness, if you can see the faces of this group of persons who commandeered your jeep and who threatened to kill you and who ordered you to stop at Paniqui, Tarlac, and which you saw again the following day in the morning at Paniqui, Tarlac, would you be able to recognize their faces again if you will see these people?
 
 
 
âA
 
 
Yes, sir.

The eyewitnesses categorically identified the malefactors. The alleged discrepancies in the testimony of the witnesses could easily be explained by the fact that they saw the incident from different angles of the shooting. The impact of events, as well as the unconscious working of the mind, it is said, could readily warp the human perception in varying ways and degrees. Empiric data is yet to be found in order to accurately measure the value of testimony of a witness other than its conformity to human behavior and the common experience of mankind.
[14]
The defense of 
alibi 
proffered by appellants is much too weak against the positive identification made by the eyewitnesses. It is not enough for an alibi to prosper to prove that the person raising it has been somewhere else when the crime is committed; it must likewise be demonstrated that it would have been physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.
[15]
 Where there is the least chance to be present at the 
locus criminis, alibi
 will not hold much water.
[16]
 The bare evidence given by appellants to vouch their individual claims and establish alibi is far from being iron-clad against the possibility of their having been at the crime scene.
Article 248
[17]
 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659, makes a person guilty of murder if the killing is attended by, among other circumstances (but not here appurtenant), treachery or evident premeditation. An essence of treachery is not only the swiftness and the surprise in the attack upon an unsuspecting victim but also the attendance of two concurring conditions, i.e., that the malefactor must have employed means, method or manner of execution that would insure his safety from the retaliatory act of the victim, and such means, method or form of execution are consciously and deliberately adopted by the malefactor. The qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation, on the other hand, requires that the execution of the criminal act be preceded by cool thought and reflection upon a resolution to carry out the criminal intent during the space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.
[18]
 Evident premeditation needs proof of the time when the intent to commit the crime is engendered in the mind of the accused, the motive which gives rise to it, and the means which are beforehand selected to carry out that intent. All such facts and antecedents which make notorious the pre-existing design to accomplish the criminal purpose must be proven to the satisfaction of the court.
[19]
A scrutiny of the facts in evidence would indicate a scanty showing of the requirements to qualify the senseless killing of the five victims, either by treachery or by evident premeditation, to murder. While the attack upon the victims could be described as being unexpected, somehow voiding any risk to the perpetrators thereof, there, is, however, insufficient evidence to indicate that the means adopted by the appellants have consciously been adopted. Mere suddenness of the attack is not enough to show treachery; it should also be shown that the mode of attack has knowingly been intended to accomplish the wicked intent.
[20]
 Neither would evident premeditation qualify the offense to murder in the absence of clear substantiation that the appellants have definitely resolved to commit the offense and have reflected on the means to bring about the execution following an appreciable length of time.
The trial court, however, correctly appreciated conspiracy. The presence of conspiracy could be revealed by the acts done before, during and after the commission of the crime that made evident a joint purpose, concerted action and concurrence of sentiments.
[21]
 The several acts of appellants during and after the shooting rampage disclosed a unison of objectives. Not one tried to stop the other in the perpetration of the crime. All were clearly in it together, performing specific acts with such closeness and coordination as would unmistakably show a common scheme. The attendance of treachery would thus render it unnecessary for the prosecution to show who among the conspirators actually hit and killed their victims, each of them being equally liable with the other in the perpetration of the crime.
Without proof of any circumstance that would qualify it, the killing could not amount to murder. Appellants should thus be held liable only for homicide for the death of each of the victims. It was alleged in the accusatory information and shown in evidence that the crimes were indeed perpetrated with the use of unlicensed firearms. Pursuant to Republic Act 8294
[22]
 (amending Presidential Decree No. 1866), which was already in effect when the killing spree occurred, if âhomicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance.â
The trial court has convicted FOl Felipe dela Cruz as an accessory. This Court, however, finds no evidence to convict him as such accessory. Under Article 19 of the Revised Penal Code, the actual knowledge of the commission of the crime is an important element to being an encubridor, and the records are bereft of sound proof that dela Cruz has had knowledge of any or all of the nefarious deeds earlier committed by his guests.
The arrest of appellants has been made in âhot pursuit,â an exception from the rule that warrantless arrests are illegal. In any event, appellants can no longer assail the illegality of their arrest since such a claim has not been brought up before or during the arraignment. The failure to timely move for the quashal of the Information on this basis operates as a waiver of the right to question the supposed irregularity of the arrest.
[23]
The crime of homicide is punishable under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code by reclusion temporal with a duration of 12 years and 1 day to 20 years. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the appellants may be held to suffer imprisonment, as minimum, of anywhere within the full range of prision mayor of from 6 years and 1 day to 12 years and, as maximum, to anywhere within the range of reclusion temporal in its maximum period, considering the attendance of the aggravating circumstance of âuse of an unlicensed firearm,â of from 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 20 years.
The damages awarded by the trial court accord with prevailing jurisprudence except for the grant of P100,000.00 moral damages to the heirs of each of the victims which amount should be reduced to P50,000.00.
WHEREFORE
, the assailed judgment of the court 
a quo
 convicting appellants is 
AFFIRMED 
subject to the following 
MODIFICATIONS,
 to wit:
Appellants Dominador Recepcion, Audie Dona, Alfredo Baracas, Eduardo Palacpac, Bernardo Ranara, Joemari delos Reyes and Robert Alfonso are all hereby found guilty of homicide, on five counts, and each of them shall suffer five imprisonment terms, each for the death of their five victims, of the indeterminate penalty of 9 years and 1 day of prision mayor, as minimum, to 16 years and 1 day of reclusion temporal in its maximum period, as maximum, and shall pay, jointly and severally, the sums adjudged by the trial court except that the P100,000.00 moral damages to each victim is reduced, correspondingly, to P50,000.00.
Appellant Felipe dela Cruz is ACQUITTED for insufficiency of evidence.
