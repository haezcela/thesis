BEN B. RICO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.

QUISUMBING, J.:


For review on 
certiorari
 is
the decision
[1]
 dated June 15, 1998 of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. CR No. 19764, affirming the judgment
[2]
 of the Regional Trial Court of Laoag City which
found the petitioner guilty of five counts of violation of Batas Pambansa Blg.
22 (the Bouncing Checks Law), and the resolution
[3]
 dated January 7, 1999 denying petitionerâs motion
for reconsideration.


Petitioner Ben Rico was a â
pakyaw
â
contractor who used to purchase construction materials on credit from private
complainant Ever Lucky Commercial (ELC), represented by Victor Chan,
Manager.  Petitioner made payments
either in cash or by postdated checks.  On several occasions, he issued checks to ELC, which were dishonored by
the bank upon presentment for payment for âinsufficiency of fundsâ or âclosed
accountâ, as follows:

Consequently, petitioner was charged under several informations
docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 5796, 5797, 5798, 5799 and 5800 for violation
of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22.  The
information in Criminal Case No. 5796 reads:


That on or about the 27th day of October, 1990, in the City of
Laoag, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously
draw and issue Check No. 04142 in the amount of Eighty One Thousand Eight
Hundred Pesos (
P
81,800.00), dated November 5, 1990, drawn against the
Philippine Commercial and International Bank, Laoag City Branch, in favor of
the Ever Lucky Commercial, as payee, in payment of construction materials which
he purchased on credit from the said Ever Lucky Commercial, located at Brgy.
No. 12, Gen. Segundo Ave., Laoag City, of which Mr. Victor Chan is the Gen.
Manager, knowing fully well that he had no sufficient funds deposited with the
drawee bank to cover the payment thereof, as in fact it was dishonored when
presented for payment to the drawee bank on November 13, 1990, on the ground
that it was drawn against insufficient funds, and the accused, despite due
notice to him of the dishonor of said check had not paid the amount thereof nor
had he made arrangements for its payment in full by the drawee bank within five
(5) banking days from receipt of the notice of dishonor, to the damage and
prejudice of the Ever Lucky Commercial in the amount of 
P
81,800.00,

The five informations were consolidated by the lower court.  Upon arraignment, petitioner pleaded not
guilty to all the charges, and trial on the merits ensued.


The prosecution established that petitioner, who used to purchase
construction materials on credit from ELC, issued the above-cited checks as
payment for the materials and that they were dishonored upon presentment for
payment to the bank either for âinsufficient fundsâ or âaccount closedâ.  After the checks were dishonored, ELC
demanded payments from petitioner, who failed to make good his undertaking to
replace the checks.  No formal written
demand letter or notice of dishonor, however, was sent to the petitioner.  It was also established by the prosecution
that ELC, through its manager, issued several receipts covering several
payments in various amounts made by petitioner as replacement of some
dishonored but returned checks as well as for payment of materials purchased.  No official receipts covering the materials
purchased, however, were presented in court as evidence.
[5]


In his defense, petitioner did not deny that he issued the
subject checks and that they were dishonored upon presentment for payment with
the drawee bank.  He claimed, however,
that he already paid the amounts covered by the checks, totalling 
P
284,340.50,
including interest.  In support thereof,
he submitted as evidence the following official receipts issued by ELC

According to petitioner, the difference between the total amount
as reflected in the receipts and the total amount covered by the subject checks
represented interest.

He also admitted that he did not retrieve the dishonored checks as they were
not yet fully paid.
[8]


On March 13, 1996, the trial court rendered its judgment as follows:


(1) In Criminal Case No. 5796,
the accused is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the violation of
BP Bilang 22.  He is sentenced to suffer
the straight penalty of ONE (1) YEAR imprisonment and to indemnify the offended
party in the amount of 
P
81,800.00;


(2) In Criminal Case No. 5797,
the accused is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the violation of
BP Bilang 22.  He is sentenced to suffer
the straight penalty of SIX (6) MONTHS imprisonment and to indemnify the
offended party in the amount of 
P
25,000.00;


(3) In Criminal Case No. 5798,
the accused is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the violation of
BP Bilang 22.  He is sentenced to suffer
the straight penalty of THREE (3) MONTHS imprisonment and to indemnify the
offended party in the amount of 
P
4,834.00;


(4) In Criminal Case No. 5799,
the accused is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the violation of
BP Bilang 22.  He is sentenced to suffer
the straight penalty of ONE (1) YEAR Imprisonment and to indemnify the offended
party in the amount of 
P
54,250.00; and


(5) In Criminal Case No. 5800,
the accused is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the violation of
BP Bilang 22.  He is sentenced to suffer
the straight penalty of SIX (6) MONTHS imprisonment and to indemnify the
offended party in the amount of 
P
12,550.00.


Costs against the accused.


SO ORDERED.
[9]


In convicting petitioner, the trial court noted that petitioner
had admitted the issuance and dishonor of the subject checks, and he could not
escape criminal liability as it found his defense of payment off-tangent.
[10]

It ruled that the alleged payments do not apply to the subject checks but for
the other materials purchased, and granting they were applicable, they could
only affect his civil liability.
[11]

Further, the trial court concluded that a mathematical computation of the
payments made by the petitioner 
vis-a-vis

the subject checks did not give credence to the stance of petitioner.  The trial court found it illogical for
petitioner to have paid more than the amounts covered by the subject checks
without a single alleged payment matching any of the amounts written in the
subject checks, and with petitioner paying more than his outstanding
liabilities at some point.
[12]


Aggrieved, petitioner filed an appeal before the Court of
Appeals, which affirmed the trial courtâs decision.  The Court of Appeals found petitionerâs defense of payment
untenable and not proven by clear and convincing evidence.  It further stated that even if there were
payment, petitioner failed to prove that it was made within five days from
receipt of notice of dishonor.
[13]

In relation thereto, it ruled that the testimonial evidence of private
complainant declaring that immediate demands to pay were made on petitioner is
in themselves notices of dishonor.
[14]

Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration was denied in a resolution dated
January 7, 1999.


Hence, this petition raising issues based on the alleged errors
of the appellate court.


MAIN ISSUE:


THE
APPELLATE COURT COMMITTED A GRAVE MISTAKE IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURTâS
FINDING THAT THE PETITIONER IN THE FIVE (5) CRIMINAL CASES IS GUILTY BEYOND
REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE VIOLATION OF BP BILANG 22 AND SENTENCING HIM TO SUFFER
THE PENALTY IMPOSED THEREIN.

THE

OWN INNOCENCE INSTEAD OF LAYING THE BURDEN UPON THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THE
GUILT OF PETITIONER BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.

THE

OVERTHROW THE

PETITIONER ARE IN THEMSELVES NOTICES OF DISHONOR.


III


THE
APPELLATE COURT ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURTâS FINDING THAT THE PAYMENTS
MADE BY THE PETITIONER TO THE EVER LUCKY COMMERCIAL (ELC) AS EVIDENCED BY
OFFICIAL RECEIPT ISSUED BY ELC REFER TO OTHER TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE
PETITIONER AND ELC AND NOT TO THE DISHONORED CHECKS.


IV


THE APPELLATE COURT ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE
TRIAL COURTâS ANALYSIS DEBUNKING PETITIONERâS DEFENSE OF PAYMENTS.
[15]


In our view, the principal issue for our resolution is whether or
not petitionerâs guilt has been established beyond reasonable doubt.


Petitioner contends that he should be acquitted of all charges
because he already paid his obligations to Ever Lucky Commercial.  He likewise avers that the prosecution
failed to establish all the elements of the crime, particularly that he had
knowledge of the insufficiency of his funds in the bank at the time he issued
the checks.  This failure, according to
petitioner, can be traced to the prosecutionâs inability to prove that notices
of dishonor were sent to him.


The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), for appellee, argues
that the payments made by petitioner refer to different transactions and not to
those covered by the checks subject matter of this case.  The OSG also avers that the verbal demands
made by private complainant are more than enough to prove that petitioner had
knowledge of the insufficiency of his funds in the bank at the time he issued
the checks.


At the outset, we must stress
that as a general rule, the factual findings of the trial court, when affirmed
by the Court of Appeals, are accorded respect and finality, unless tainted with
arbitrariness or palpable error,
[16]
 or when the trial court failed to appreciate
certain facts and circumstances which, if taken into account, would materially
affect the result of the case.
[17]
  We find
that the exceptions rather than the general rule apply in this case.  We also find the petition meritorious.


The law enumerates the
elements of violation of B.P. 22, namely (1) the making, drawing and issuance
of any check to apply for account or for value; (2) the knowledge of the maker,
drawer, or issuer that at the time of issue he does not have sufficient funds
in or credit with the drawee bank for the payment of the check in full upon its
presentment; and (3) the subsequent dishonor of the check by the drawee bank
for insufficiency of funds or credit or dishonor for the same reason had not
the drawer, without any valid cause, ordered the bank to stop payment.
[18]


The first and third elements of the offense are present and
proved in these consolidated cases.  But
we find that the second element was not sufficiently established.


Knowledge of insufficiency of
funds or credit in the drawee bank for the payment of a check upon its
presentment is an essential element of the offense.
[19]
 In several cases,
[20]
 we have ruled that to hold a person liable under
B.P. 22, it is not enough to establish that a check was dishonored upon
presentment.  It must be shown further
that the person who issued the check knew at the time of issue that he does not
have sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank for the payment of such
check in full upon its presentment.  Because this element involves a state of mind which is difficult to
establish, Section 2 of the law creates a 
prima
facie
 presumption of such knowledge.


SEC. 2.  
Evidence
of knowledge of insufficient funds
. â The making, drawing and issuance of a
check payment of which is refused by the drawee because of insufficient funds
or credit with such bank, when presented within ninety (90) days from the date
of the check, shall be 
prima facie evidence
 of knowledge of
such insufficiency of funds or credit 
unless such maker or drawer pays the holder
thereof the amount due thereon, or makes arrangements for payment in full by
the drawee of such check within five (5) banking days after 
receiving notice

that such check has not been paid by the drawee
.â  (Italics and underscoring supplied)


In 
King vs. People
,
[21]
 we held:


... The 
prima facie
 presumption arises when a check is issued.  But the law also provides that the
presumption does not arise when the issuer pays the amount of the check or
makes arrangement for its payment within five banking days after 
receiving
 notice that such check has not
been paid by the drawee.


Thus, the presumption that
the issuer had knowledge of the insufficiency of funds is brought into
existence 
only after it is proved that
the issuer had received a notice of dishonor
 and that, within five days
from receipt thereof, he failed to pay the amount of the check or to make
arrangement for its payment.
[22]


Here, both the Court of Appeals and the trial court relied solely on the
testimony of prosecution witness Danilo Cac to the effect that private
complainant immediately demanded payment of the value of the checks after they
were dishonored.  Aside from this
self-serving testimony, no other evidence was presented to prove the giving and
receiving of such notice.  The nature
and content of said demands were not clarified.  Even the date when and the manner by which these alleged demands
were made upon and received by petitioner were not specified.  Worse, the records do not show that formal
and written demand letters or notices of dishonor were ever sent to petitioner.


Where the presumption of
knowledge of insufficiency of funds does not arise due to the absence of notice
of dishonor of the check, the accused should not be held liable for the offense
defined under the first paragraph of Section 1 of B.P. 22.
[23]


As held in the case of 
Lao vs. Court of Appeals
[24]
 a notice of dishonor personally sent to and
received by the accused is necessary before one can be held liable under B.P.
22.  In that case, we stated thus:


Because no notice of dishonor
was actually sent to and received by the petitioner, the 
prima facie

presumption that she knew about the insufficiency of funds cannot apply.  Section 2 of BP Blg. 22 clearly provides
that this presumption arises not from the mere fact of drawing, making, and
issuing a bum check; there must also be a showing that, within five banking
days from receipt of the notice of dishonor, such maker or drawer failed to pay
the holder of the check the amount due thereon or to make arrangement for its
payment in full by the drawee of such check.


It has been observed that the
State, under this statute, actually offers the violator âa compromise by
allowing him to perform some act which operates to preempt the criminal action,
and if he opts to perform it the action is abated.â  xxx  
The absence of a notice of dishonor
necessarily deprives an accused an opportunity to preclude a criminal
prosecution.  Accordingly, procedural due
process clearly enjoins that a notice of dishonor be actually served on
petitioner
.  Petitioner has a right
to demand - and the basic postulates of fairness require - that the notice of
dishonor be actually sent to and received by her to afford her the opportunity
to avert prosecution under BP Blg. 22.  (Italics supplied.)


In other words, if such notice of non-payment by the drawee bank
is not sent to the maker or drawer of the bum check, or if there is no proof as
to when such notice was received by the drawer, then the presumption of
knowledge as provided in Section 2 of B.P. 22 cannot arise, since there would
simply be 
no way of reckoning the crucial
five-day period
.
[25]


As stated earlier, the prosecution not only failed to prove the
receipt by petitioner of any notice of dishonor, the records are also bereft of
any indication that written formal demand letters or notice of dishonor were
actually sent to petitioner.  In recent
cases, we had the occasion to emphasize that not only must there be a written
notice of dishonor or demand letters actually received by the drawer of a
dishonored check, but there must also be 
proof
of receipt
 thereof that is properly authenticated, and not mere registered
receipt and/or return receipt.


Thus, as held in 
Domagsang vs.
Court of Appeals
,
[26]

while Section 2 of B.P. 22 indeed does not state that the notice of dishonor be
in writing, this must be taken in conjunction with Section 3 of the law, 
i.e.
, âthat where there are no
sufficient funds in or credit with such drawee bank, such fact 
shall always be explicitly stated in the
notice of dishonor or refusal
â.  A
mere oral notice or demand to pay would appear to be insufficient for
conviction under the law.  In our view,
both the spirit and the letter of the Bouncing Checks Law require for the act
to be punished thereunder not only that the accused issued a check that is
dishonored, but also that the accused has 
actually
been notified in writing
 of the fact of dishonor.  The consistent rule is that penal statutes must be construed
strictly against the State and liberally in favor of the accused.  In 
Victor
Ting vs. Court of Appeals
,
[27]

we stated that when service of a notice is sought to be made by mail, it should
appear that conditions exist on which the validity of such service depends.  Otherwise, the evidence is insufficient to
establish the fact of service.  Receipts
for registered letters and return receipts do not by themselves prove receipt;
they must be properly authenticated to serve as proof of receipt of the
letters.


In fine, the failure of the prosecution to prove the existence
and receipt by petitioner of the requisite written notice of dishonor and that
he was given at least five banking days within which to settle his account
constitutes sufficient ground for his acquittal.


However, while petitioner is acquitted for violation of B.P. 22,
he should be ordered to pay the face value of the five dishonored checks plus
legal interest in accordance with our ruling in 
Domagsang vs. Court of Appeals
.
[28]
  There, the prosecution failed to
sufficiently establish a case to warrant conviction, but clearly proved
petitionerâs failure to pay a just debt owing to the private complainant.  Thus, petitioner was ordered to pay the face
value of the check with 12 percent legal interest per annum, reckoned from the
filing of the information until the finality of the decision.  It is well settled that an acquittal based
on reasonable doubt does not preclude the award of civil damages.  The judgment of acquittal extinguishes the
liability of the accused for damages only when it includes a declaration that
the facts from which the civil liability might arise did not exist.  Thus, the civil liability is not
extinguished by acquittal where the acquittal is based on lack of proof beyond
reasonable doubt, since only preponderance of evidence is required in civil
cases.  There appears to be no sound
reason to require that a separate civil action be still filed considering that
the facts to be proved in the civil case have already been established in the
criminal proceedings where the accused was acquitted.  To require a separate civil action would mean needless clogging
of court dockets and unnecessary duplication of litigation with all its
attendant loss of time, effort, and money on the part of all concerned.
[29]


Finally, we agree that petitionerâs alleged prior payment is
untenable.  As found by the trial court
and by the Court of Appeals, it is unnatural and illogical for petitioner to
have paid more than his outstanding obligations.  It is also unlikely that he would pay substantial amounts of
interest when nothing had been agreed upon on this matter.  It is quite striking how he could have
generously paid more than what was due from him when he could hardly pay private
complainant in cash, and had to issue post-dated checks.  Moreover, he could have asked for the return
of the checks as a matter of sound business practice and procedure if indeed he

contradicts petitionerâs allegation of payment.
