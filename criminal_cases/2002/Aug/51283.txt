PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. LEONARDO DUMANLANG, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




KAPUNAN,
J.:


 
On January 30, 1997, the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 28, found the accused Leonardo Dumanlang guilty of two (2) counts of rape and imposed upon him the supreme penalty of death on each count. These cases are now before us for automatic review. 
 
 These criminal cases stemmed from two (2) Informations filed against the accused. Except as to the dates of the commission of the crime,
[1]
 the Informations commonly alleged as follows: 
 
 
That on or about May 1994, in San Marcelino Street, Ermita, Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused LEONARDO DUMANLANG Y ENRIQUEZ actuated by lust and by means of force and intimidation, wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously did then and there lie and succeeded in having carnal knowledge with EDNA MACASSADU Y BRUNO inside room 204 of Dâ Travellerâs Pension House against her will and consent and to her damage and prejudice.
[2]
 
 
 
On August 2, 1994, the accused, duly assisted by his counsel, entered a plea of not guilty in each of the two cases. Thereafter, joint trial proceeded. 
 The facts are as follows: 
 
Edna Macassadu came to Manila from Sto. NiÃ±o, Cagayan to look for a job. On May 11, 1994, she went to the Diamond Employment Agency located in Agoncillo St., Malate, Manila.
[3]
 Josephine Biturin, manager of the said employment agency, sent her to Dâ Travellerâs Pension House in San Marcelino St., Malate, Manila to work as a counter girl.
[4]
 When Edna arrived at the pension house, she saw the accused Leonardo Dumanlang. The latter asked her name and gave her a bio-data form for her to fill up. After filling up her application form, Edna was told to bring her bag upstairs. She followed and after placing her clothes in the room assigned to her, she was made to eat as it was already twelve thirty in the afternoon.
[5]
 
 
After lunch, a certain Glorina told her to go downstairs. Edna was handed a copy of the rules and regulations.
[6]
 Thereafter, Leonardo directed Edna to go to his office upstairs. Edna was led to Room 204 where she was made to sit on a chair near a bed.
[7]
 Leonardo then went out of the room and Edna read the rules and regulations given to her. Moments later, Leonardo came back, closed and locked the door. He told Edna that âhe didnât want to be answered with âho, po or opo.â Edna was so frightened because Leonardo was smiling and laughing while sitting in front of her. She asked him why he locked the door, but Leonardo just said âOops, you said po, come here and kiss me.â Alarmed, Edna stood up to get out of the room but Leonardo prevented her from doing so.
[8]
 Leonardo forced her to kiss him. He then pushed her to the bed and laid on top of her. She tried to resist but the accused was too strong for her. She shouted for help but Leonardo pulled a gun from his waist and pointed it at Edna who was trembling in fear.
[9]
 Leonardo forcibly unbuttoned Ednaâs blouse and kissed her on her lips and from the cheeks down. He pulled her brassiere and sucked her breast. He then pulled her pants and underwear. Edna pleaded for pity but Leonardo only laughed at her.
[10]
 He unzipped his pants and brought out his penis. Then using his feet, he pushed Ednaâs thighs apart. After succeeding in spreading Ednaâs legs, Leonardo inserted his penis into her vagina.
[11]
 Edna felt pain but she could not do anything but cry. After satisfying his lust, Leonardo fixed himself and told Edna to stand up. When she refused, he pulled her up, made her sit on the chair and told her to put on her clothes and get back to her room.
[12]
 Edna went to her room, wept and stayed there until six in the evening when Glorina told her to go downstairs. Leonardo then instructed Edna to watch the counter of the pension house. She stayed at the counter from six in the evening until two in the morning. Leonardo also stayed there until twelve midnight.
[13]
 
 
Edna woke up at around six oâclock the following morning, May 12, 1994. She had some coffee and, as instructed, cleaned the counter.
[14]
 At around eight oâclock, she saw the accused at the stairways. Leonardo asked her to make coffee for him in Room 206.
[15]
 Out of fear, she obeyed and went to Room 206 to make coffee. Leonardo followed her inside and closed the door. As she was mixing the coffee in a glass, the accused embraced her. She fought back and slapped him. Leonardo slapped her back, got the gun from under the mattress of the bed and pointed it at her. He undressed her, raised her skirt, removed her underwear, and for the second time, succeeded in having carnal knowledge with her.
[16]
 
 
Edna stayed at the pension house until May 16, 1994, when Leonardo and Josephine Biturin, who she later learned was his common-law wife, transferred her to another employer, Lorena Raymond.
[17]
 Edna lost no time in revealing to Lorena her ordeal with the accused. Lorena and her uncle Ding Ocampo brought Edna to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and her statements were taken.
[18]
 She was also medically examined. Thereafter, Edna led some NBI agents to the pension house.
[19]
 
 
When Edna testified in court, she was already staying with San Marcelino Barangay Chairman Alice Reyes Santos. She sought the barangay chairmanâs help because she has no other relatives in Manila. After she filed her complaint against the accused, Edna was given employment at the Manila City Hall. However, she did not last long in her work because some people who presented themselves as policemen pressured her into withdrawing the case against the accused.
[20]
 She recalled that Atty. Bert Domingo,
[21]
 then a councilor in the City of Manila, likewise offered her money and asked her to sign an Affidavit of Desistance.
[22]
 
 
Elex Crelencia, an NBI senior agent, was the team leader of the NBI operatives that proceeded to the pension house on May 23, 1994.
[23]
 His team included, among others, agents Tiempo, Paul Gino Rivera, Eric Isodoro and Nestor de Guzman.
[24]
 When they reached the place, they were able to enter the pension house without any resistance from anybody. They found the accused inside Room 206 and Edna readily identified him as the one who raped her.
[25]
 Leonardo asked the NBI agents if they have any warrant of arrest issued against him. They told him that there was a complaint for rape against him and they were just inviting him to the NBI office for questioning.
[26]
 At the NBI office, they apprised him of his constitutional rights before they conducted their investigation.
[27]
 However, Leonardo did not execute any statement.
[28]
 The NBI then referred the case to the Department of Justice.
[29]
 
 
Dr. Anabelle Solliman, a medico-legal officer of the NBI, recalled that on May 23, 1994, at four oâclock in the afternoon, she conducted a medical examination on Edna.
[30]
 She found that Edna had laceration in her private organ at eight oâclock position. Such laceration was normally caused by sexual intercourse.
[31]
 Prior thereto, the subject was a virgin.
[32]
 She added that the laceration would heal in about three to four weeks.
[33]
 
 
Dr. Aina Retizos, a resident physician at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH),
[34]
 testified that on August 10, 1994, she conducted an examination on Edna who was complaining of vaginal discharge.
[35]
 She found out that the patient was suffering from a pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection of the female genital tract that includes the uterus and both fallopian tubes.
[36]
 She testified that such vaginal discharge is unusual for a patient who had not sexual contact nor had foreign object inserted in her private organ.
[37]
 She added that the pelvic inflammatory disease was probably caused by the sexual assault.
[38]
 
 
Atty. Libertad Ramos-Rasa, Branch Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 28, testified that on August 8, 1994, at the behest of defense counsel Atty. Domingo, an ocular inspection was made at Dâ Travellerâs Pension House.
[39]
 They found two (2) gun belts containing nineteen (19) live ammunitions under the mattress of a bed in Room 206.
[40]
 The trial judge ordered the confiscation of such ammunitions without any objection from Atty. Domingo.
[41]
 
 
The accused merely denied the accusations against him. He testified that he owns Dâ Travellerâs Pension House located in 650 San Marcelino St., Ermita, Manila, a four-storey building with mezzanine. It is run like a hotel and is managed by him whenever he is in the Philippines, or by his sister-in-law or by his common-law wife, Josephine Biturin.
[42]
 The accused is a permanent resident of Chicago, Illinois, and he has some businesses there. The accused testified that the pension house was run like a hotel, and lodgers were required to fill up their registration form where their names, company names and addresses were stated.
[43]
 Room 204 was occupied by different lodgers at the time of the alleged rape.
[44]
 
 
On May 23, 1994, Leonardo was sleeping in Room 206 when five (5) to seven (7) NBI agents woke him up. A gun was pointed at him and he was informed that a complaint for rape was filed against him.
[45]
 He was invited to the NBI office but he refused, so they beat him up. However, he never submitted himself to a medical examination because he was detained.
[46]
 He was brought to the NBI office at about six-thirty in the evening dressed only in briefs.
[47]
 He was never allowed to communicate with his family until May 25, 1994.
[48]
 He also denied owning a gun.
[49]
 
 
Josephine Biturin testified that she and the accused have been living together since 1992. They have two children. She manages the Diamond Employment Agency owned by Leonardo. She likewise testified that Leonardo owns Dâ Travellerâs Pension House in San Marcelino St., Ermita, Manila.
[50]
 
 
Josephine met Edna when the latter applied as a househelper in the Diamond Employment Agency on May 9, 1994. She gave her a bio-data form to fill-up and interviewed her. She then told Edna that if sheâs interested to work, she could take her belongings and proceed to Dâ Travellerâs Pension House in San Marcelino Street.
[51]
 
 
Edna started to work at the pension house on May 9, 1994. When Josephine went to the pension house on May 9 and 10, she observed nothing unusual with Edna.
[52]
 On May 16, 1994, she transferred Edna to another employer, Lorena Raymond in Sucat, ParaÃ±aque.
[53]
 
 
Josephine recalled that on May 23, 1994, Leonardo was picked-up by some men from the pension house.
[54]
 She searched for him in all police stations in Manila but failed to see him.
[55]
 The following morning, May 24, 1994, she found Leonardo at the NBI detention cell. Leonardo told her to look for a lawyer.
[56]
 When she came back in the afternoon, Leonardo informed her that the NBI agents wanted to settle the case for P300,000.00.
[57]
 The accused instructed her to call up his brother and sister in Chicago, USA to raise money.
[58]
 At twelve midnight, some NBI agents, one of whom was Armand Ardanas, went to the pension house, accompanied by one Renato Recto. Upon instructions from Leonardo, she gave money to Armand Ardanas and Renato Recto. Likewise, thirty-five thousand pesos (P35,000.00) was given to Edith Tanuco.
[59]
 
 
Josephine also testified that per the receipts on their records, Room 204 was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. de Rivera on May 9, 1994. On May 10, 1994, the room was occupied by Mr. Bengador. On May 11, 1994, it was occupied by Mr. Alex Azucena. On May 12, 1994, Room 204 was occupied by Mr. Teodoro Carreon.
[60]
 Josephine further testified that Room 206 was being repaired on May 12, 1994.
[61]
 
 
Merlyn Jupiter,
[62]
 testifying for the defense, declared before the court that she was residing at Dâ Travellerâs Pension House in San Marcelino St., Ermita, Manila. She worked as a babysitter of the child of accused. She said that she never met Edna at the pension house. She recalled that at about nine oâclock in the evening of May 24, 1994, she was at the Diamond Employment Agency in Agoncillo St., Malate, Manila. Edith Tanuco arrived and told Merlyn to go with her as they would move to another place of employment. Merlyn saw a red L-300 van parked at the back of the Diamond Employment Agency. Thinking that the passenger inside the van was their new employer, she went with Edith and they boarded the van. Inside the van were three males and one female. She asked Edith who were those men and the latter replied that they were secret agents. She later learned that the female passenger was Edna. They were brought to the NBI office where Edith told her that they were filing charges for rape against Leonardo their employer. Edith added that they would get big money out of it. Edith coached Merlyn what to say. One Mauro Garcia of the NBI prepared the statements that she signed.
[63]
 Merlyn later retracted her statements before the NBI and filed an affidavit of desistance withdrawing the rape case against the accused.
[64]
 
 
Elpidio Cabutan, Jr., Records Officer II at PGH, presented to the court the records of the birth of the child of Merlyn Jupiter, which showed that she gave birth to a baby boy on May 30, 1994, belying the allegation that she was raped by the accused on May 23, 1994.
[65]
 The testimony of Cabutan was presented to bolster the accusedâs defense that the rape charges were planned and part of an extortion scheme. 
 
Unimpressed with the accusedâs attempt to exculpate himself, the trial court rendered its decision, dated January 30, 1997, finding Leonardo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape for two counts. The dispositive portion of the decision read: 
 
WHEREFORE, finding the accused, Leonardo Dumanlang y Enriquez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in Criminal Case No. 94-137790 with the use of a gun, a deadly weapon, and with only one aggravating circumstance of the use of craft to facilitate the commission of the crime, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the ultimate penalty of death and to pay to the offended party, Edna B. Macassadu, moral damages in the sum of P50,000.00. 
 Likewise finding the said accused Leonardo Dumanlang Enriquez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in Criminal Case No. 94-137791 with the use of a gun, a deadly weapon, and with only one aggravating circumstance of craft to aid him in the commission of the felony, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty of death and to also pay the offended party moral damages in the sum of P50,000.00.

Thereafter, the records of the cases were elevated to this Court for automatic review. 
 Accused-appellant raises the following assignment of errors: 
 
 
I 
 
THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING AND CONCLUDING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT USED A GUN IN RAVISHING THEHONOR OF COMPLAINANT EDNA MACASSADU y BRUNO ON TWO OCCASIONS OF AN (SIC) ALLEGED RAPES COMMITTED ALLEGEDLY AT ROOM 204 OF ACCUSED APPELLANTâS Dâ TRAVELLERâS PENSION HOUSE ON MAY 11 AND 12, 1994. 
 
II 
 
THE TRIAL COURT ACTED IN EXCESS OF ITS JURISDICTION AND WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED A DEGREE OF ZEAL, BIAS AND PARTIALITY IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE ALLEGED RAPE CASES AGAINST ACCUSED-APPELLANT, MORE PARTICULARLY IN THE USE OF GUN IN THE CONSUMMATION OF THE ALLEGED RAPE CASES OF THE ALLEGED COMPLAINANT EDNA MACASSADU y BRUNO. 
 
III 
 
THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED WITH DUE RESPECT IN NOT SCRUTINIZING WITH CAUTION AND UTMOST CARE COMPLAINANTâS TESTIMONY WHICH IS RIDDLED WITH MATERIAL CONTRADICTION AND INCONSISTENCIES, INHERENTLY IMPROBABLE AND NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE COMMON OBSERVATION AND EXPERIENCE OF MANKIND. 
 
IV 
 
THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED WITH DUE RESPECT IN TOTALLY DISREGARDING THE TESTIMONIAL AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF THE DEFENSE TO WARRANT THE ACQUITTAL OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT. 
 
V 
 
THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN TOTALLY DISREGARDING THE TESTIMONIAL AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF THE OFFENSE. 
 
VI 
 
THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY AND SERIOUSLY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT FOR THE TWO (2) INFORMATIONS HE STAND CHARGED IN COURT, AND IN THE IMPOSITION OF TWO (2) SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH, AND 
 
VII 
 
THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING AND HOLDING AN ALLEGED OFFER OF COMPROMISE AN ACCUSED-APPELLANT IMPLIED ADMISSION OF HIS GUILT.
[67]
 
 
 
We sustain accused-appellantâs conviction. 
 
Much of accused-appellantâs contentions stressed on inconsistencies in Ednaâs statements, particularly, on the dates she was supposedly raped by accused-appellant. According to accused-appellant, Edna said in her previous statements, as well as in the information she provided to the physician who medically examined her, that she was raped by the accused on May 9 and 10, 1994, contrary to her testimony that she was ravished by the appellant on May 11 and 12, 1994. 
 
This contention is without merit. Edna sufficiently explained during trial that when she gave the statements that she was raped on May 9 and 10, 1994, she was tensed and confused.
[68]
 Errorless recollection of a harrowing experience cannot be expected of a witness, especially when she is recounting details of an experience so humiliating and so painful as rape.
[69]
 Further, Edna testified that she remembered asking the NBI to correct the dates when she was giving her statements but apparently, no such change was made.
[70]
 It is well-settled that between the contents of a sworn statement and testimony in open court, the latter generally prevails since ex-parte affidavits are often incomplete and inaccurate because by their nature, they are ordinarily prepared by a person other than the affiant.
[71]
 The Court would like to stress that the exact date of the commission of the rape is not an essential element of the crime.
[72]
 What is material is that the commission of the rape by accused-appellant against complainant is sufficiently proven.
[73]
 
 
In the case before us, we find the alleged inconsistencies relied upon by accused-appellant in his bid for acquittal immaterial and irrelevant. Far from eroding her credibility, Ednaâs lapses are badges of truthfulness and candor and showed that her testimony was neither rehearsed nor contrived.
[74]
 The supposed contradictions in Ednaâs statements cannot foreclose the fact that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of her. The Court also noted that while recalling her ordeal, Edna broke down and cried, indicating that she was telling the truth.
[75]
 Thus, she testified:

(Stenographer reading back the last question) 
 
Atty. delos Santos 
 
When the gun was being pointed at you, were there other things that happened?â

Accused-appellant presented to the trial court several receipts tending to show that from May 9 to 12, 1994, Room 204 was occupied by different guests, thus making it impossible for the crime to have been committed. Josephine Biturin likewise testified that the second rape could not have taken place because Room 206 was under repair at that time. 
 
We cannot accept accused-appellantâs contention. The receipts adduced by the defense do not carry much worth for being self-serving. Being the owner of the pension house, accused-appellant could have easily fabricated such receipts. The failure of the defense to present any of the alleged occupants of Room 204 casts doubt on the veracity of those documents. Fitting is the trial courtâs observations and findings on this issue: 
 
 
The accused claims that he could not have raped the complainant on May 11, 1994, in Room 204 of his pension house because on the said date, the said room was occupied by a lodger or guest as shown by the guest registration (Exh. â19â) and the receipt of payment of the guest for the use of the room (Exh. â20â). These two documents are clearly not public documents (Section 19, Rule 132, Revised Rules on Evidence) and as private documents their due execution and authenticity should have been proven to make them admissible (section 20, Ibid.). No evidence to that effect has been adduced or even offered and, therefore, they cannot be admitted in evidence. The cashier, Julie Biturin (TSN, November 23, 1995, p. 12) should have been presented as the best witness. 
 
The accused tried to show that the rooms of his pension house from May 1 to 24, 1994, were occupied by guests by presenting guest registrations and receipts of payment (Exhs. â19â to â21â with submarkings up to Exh. â21-QQ-1â and Exhs. â22â to â24â). Only Exhs. â19â and â20â are relevant and material as they involved Room 204 on May 11, 1994. The other guest registrations and receipts are not only inadmissible private documents but are utterly material. Whether or not the other rooms were occupied or not on May 11, 1994 or on other dates is absolutely irrelevant. The defense counsel evidently presented them as an attempt to show âentries in the course of businessâ under Section 43, Rule 130, Revised Rules on Evidence, as an exception to the requirement of personal knowledge. But the basis for admissions of these guest registrations and receipts had not been laid as required by the rule. The persons who executed them or made the entries and issued the receipt were not shown to be deceased or unable to testify. 
 
 
Moreover, Exh. â19â, the guest registration on May 11, 1994, is, as actually submitted to this Court, not the guest registration (being merely a xerox copy), but a reproduction of Exh. â20â, the receipt of payment, covering the supposed face of the guest registration. Clearly, it was intended to mislead and conceal the true facts stated on the face of Exh. â19â. The resort to this chicanery only confirms the testimony of the common-law wife, Josephine Biturin, that there is no time of âcheck inâ in the said guest registration or that the check in and check out was at 4:00 P.M. (TSN, November 23, 1995, p. 8) after the rape was committed at about 2:00 oâclock P.M. On cross examination, Josephine Biturin testified that the time of the check out of the guest in Room 204 on May 12, 1994, is not indicated and that she did not know when he had checked in (TSN, November 23, 1995, p. 26). 
 
The accused himself said that he could not remember the name of the guest (TSN, May 30, 1996, p.4); that when his common-law wife, (TSN, August 16, 1995, pp. 45-46) or on May 25, 1994 (according to the accused, TSN, April 12, 1996, p. 44), he remembered that Room 204 was occupied and told his common-law wife so (Ibid., p. 41) that he came to know that Room 204 was occupied on May 11, 1994, by a guest that same night when he checked the receipts when the cash was turned over to him (Ibid., p. 43), but he did not include this remembered fact in his counter-affidavit in the preliminary investigation of the cases before the Department of Justice, which could have strongly shown his innocence of the charges and would have caused his immediate release from detention, because he was âconfused and tensedâ (Ibid., p. 44), a most flimsy and unbelievable reason. The accused was clearly evasive in his answers. The evidence then of the accused is not only inadmissible but has no probative worth. They betray a desperation on his part to grasp at straws to escape criminal liability.
[79]
 
 
Anent the testimony that Room 206 was then being repaired, accused-appellant himself testified that he remembered asking someone to teach Edna to brew coffee at Room 206. Accused-appellant added that while the Room 206 was under renovation at that time, it could be occupied and he was in fact sleeping there.
[80]
 
 
As regards the presence of other people in the pension house, the Court has ruled time and again that rape is no respecter of time or place as it can be committed in places ordinarily considered as unlikely.
[81]
 It is not indispensable for rape to be committed in an isolated place as rapists bear no respect for place and time when they carry out their evil deed.
[82]
 
 
In addition to the foregoing, the testimonial evidence is corroborated by the physicianâs findings of penetration. There is sufficient foundation to conclude the existence of the essential requisite of carnal knowledge. Lacerations, whether healed or fresh, are the best physical evidence of forcible defloration.
[83]
 Indeed, a medical examination is not even an indispensable requirement in prosecutions for rape provided that the testimony of the victim is credible.
[84]
 
 
Appellantâs insinuation that Edna and her two companions filed a complaint for rape against him for the sole purpose of extorting money from him deserves scant consideration. The fact that the other complainants desisted from pursuing the case against accused-appellant after the supposed pay-off does not mean that Edna was not molested by accused-appellant. The alleged money given to an NBI agent and to Edith Tanuco in consideration for the withdrawal of the rape case against accused-appellant would not in anyway affect Ednaâs positive testimony that she was raped. If this were really true, what the accused should have done was to file criminal and administrative actions against the NBI agents who allegedly extorted money from him. It is not farfetched that the other two complainants did not pursue their cases, not because they succeeded in extorting money from accused-appellant, but because accused-appellant paid them to silence them. Edna testified that there was also an attempt to persuade her in withdrawing the case by offering money to her, only she did not give in to the pressure. There could be no other reason for her determination other than to seek justice for her plight. 
 
It appears from the records that for his defense, accused-appellant merely denied he raped the victim. However, his denial could not prevail over the positive testimony of the victim who identified accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crimes. It is axiomatic that denial is an intrinsically weak defense which must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility.
[85]
 A denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a self-serving negative evidence which cannot prevail over a positive declaration.
[86]
 Here, accused-appellant was unable to overcome the strong evidence presented by the prosecution. 
 
Nevertheless, accused-appellant was correct in saying that the trial court erred in imposing upon him the penalty of death. 
 
During the trial of the case, the defense strongly objected to the testimony of Edna which tends to prove that the commission of rape was with the use of deadly weapon. Despite the fact that it was not alleged in the information, the trial court nevertheless admitted and appreciated such qualifying circumstance and used it as its basis in the determination of the penalty imposed. 
 
The use of a weapon serves to increase the penalty and thus, said fact should be alleged in the information because of the accusedâs right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.
[87]
 The testimony as to the use of the gun cannot be considered to qualify the offense but only as a generic qualifying circumstance. Considering, however, that Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code provides that a single indivisible penalty must be applied regardless of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances which may have attended the commission of the crime,
[88]
 the use of a deadly weapon, even if proven, cannot modify the imposable penalty in the case at bar. Hence, the imposable penalty in this case should be 
reclusion perpetua
. 
 
Finally, the Court notes that while the trial court awarded moral damages in favor of the victim, it failed to award civil indemnity. Civil indemnity is separate and distinct from moral damages and is imposed upon the accused without need of proof other than the fact of the commission of the offense.
[89]
 Hence, in addition to moral damages of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos for each count of rape, accused-appellant must be likewise be sentenced to pay an additional amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos for each count of rape as civil indemnity in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.
[90]
 
 
WHEREFORE,
 the Court AFFIRMS with MODIFICATION the appealed decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 28, Manila, in Criminal Cases Nos. 94-137790 and 94-137791. Accused-appellant Leonardo Dumanlang y Enriquez is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of rape and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
Reclusion Perpetua
 on each count, with all the accessory penalties of the law, and to pay the victim Edna Macassadu y Bruno the amount of One Hundred Thousand (P100,000.00) Pesos as civil indemnity and One Hundred Thousand (P100,000.00) Pesos as moral damages. Costs against accused-appellant.
