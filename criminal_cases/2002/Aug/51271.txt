LUTGARDA CRUZ, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS, PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE HEIRS OF ESTANISLAWA C. REYES, REPRESENTED BY MIGUEL C. REYES, RESPONDENTS.

D E C I S I O N




CARPIO, J.:




This is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of 
the Rules of 
Court to reverse the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated March 31, 
1995
[1]
 and its 
Resolution dated December 1, 
1995.
[2]
 The Court
 of Appeals dismissed 
for being insufficient in substance the Petition for Certiorari and 
Mandamus, 
which sought to nullify two orders of the Regional Trial Court of 
Manila, Branch 
53, dated April 18, 1994 and May 6, 1994. 


The Antecedent Facts 


The City Prosecutor of Manila charged petitioner with the crime
 of âEstafa 
thru Falsification of Public Documentâ before the Manila Regional Trial 
Court.
[3]
 
Petitioner executed before a 
Notary Public in the City of Manila an Affidavit of Self-Adjudication of
 a 
parcel of land stating that she was the sole surviving heir of the 
registered 
owner when in fact she knew there were other surviving heirs. Since the 
offended 
party did not reserve the right to file a separate civil action arising 
from the 
criminal offense, the civil action was deemed instituted in the criminal
 case. 



After trial on the merits, the trial court rendered its 
decision dated 
January 17, 1994 acquitting petitioner on the ground of reasonable 
doubt. In the 
same decision, the trial court rendered judgment on the civil aspect of 
the 
case, ordering the return to the surviving heirs of the parcel of land 
located 
in Bulacan.
[4]


On January 28, 1994, 
petitioner received a copy of the decision. 


On February 10, 1994, petitioner filed by registered mail a 
motion for 
reconsideration dated February 7, 1994, assailing the trial courtâs 
ruling on 
the civil aspect of the criminal case. Petitioner furnished the City 
Prosecutor 
a copy of the motion by registered mail. 


On April 18, 1994, the trial court denied petitionerâs motion 
for 
reconsideration stating: 




âActing on the Motion for Reconsideration dated February 7, 
1994, filed by 
the accused through counsel and considering that there is nothing to 
show that 
the Office of the City Prosecutor was actually furnished or served with a
 copy 
of the said Motion for Reconsideration within the reglementary period of
 fifteen 
(15) days from receipt by the accused on January 28, 1994 of a copy of 
the 
Courtâs decision dated January 17, 1994, so that the same is already 
final and 
executory, let the Motion for Reconsideration be Denied for lack of 
merit.â
[5]




Petitioner moved for a reconsideration of the trial courtâs 
order of April 
18, 1994. The trial court denied the same in an order dated May 6, 1994,
 to wit: 





âUnder the Interim Rules, no party shall be allowed a second 
motion for 
reconsideration of a final order or judgment (Sec. 4). The motion of 
accused 
dated 22 April 1994 is a violation of this rule. 


WHEREFORE, said motion is DENIED.â
[6]




Left with no recourse, petitioner filed a petition for 
certiorari and 
mandamus with the Court of Appeals to nullify the two assailed orders of
 the 
trial court. Petitioner also asked the Court of Appeals to compel the 
trial 
court to resolve her motion for reconsideration of the decision dated 
February 
7, 1994. 
The Ruling of the Court of Appeals 


On March 31, 1995, the Court of Appeals denied due course to 
the petition and 
dismissed the case for being insufficient in substance. 
The 
Court of Appeals 
sustained the trial courtâs order of April 18, 1994 denying petitionerâs
 motion 
for reconsideration. The Court of Appeals declared in part: 




âSection 10, Rule 13, Rules of Court, provides as follows: 



âSEC. 10. 
Proof of Service
. â Proof of 
personal service shall 
consist of a written admission of the party served, or the affidavit of 
the 
party serving, containing a full statement of the date, place and manner
 of 
service. If the service is by ordinary mail, proof thereof shall consist
 of an 
affidavit of the person mailing of facts showing compliance with Section
 5 of 
this rule. If service is made by registered mail, proof shall be made by
 such 
affidavit and the registry receipt issued by the mailing office. The 
registry 
return card shall be filed immediately upon receipt thereof by the 
sender, or in 
lieu thereof the letter unclaimed together with the certified or sworn 
copy of 
the notice given by the postmaster to the addressee.â 



Patent from the language of the said section is that in case 
service is made 
by registered mail, proof of service shall be made by (a) affidavit of 
the 
person mailing and (b) the registry receipt issued by the mailing 
office. Both 
must concur. In the case at bench, there was no such affidavit or 
registry 
receipt when the motion was considered. Thus, respondent Judge cannot be
 said to 
have acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of 
jurisdiction, in 
ruling in the manner he did.â
[7]
 


The Court of Appeals also affirmed the trial courtâs order of 
May 6, 1994 
denying the subsequent motion for reconsideration, as follows: 





âxxx, while there is merit in petitionerâs submission that the 
motion for 
reconsideration dated April 22, 1994 was not a second motion for 
reconsideration 
of a final order or judgment, as contemplated in the Interim Rules 
because the 
motion sought to impugn the order dated 18 April 1994 not on the basis 
of the 
issues raised in the motion for reconsideration dated 07 February 1994 
but on 
the erroneous legal conclusion of the order dated May 6, 1994,
[8]
 this is already 
academic. The decision 
dated January 7, 1994 had long become final when the second motion for 
reconsideration was filed on 03 May 1994. Hence, the pairing Judge who 
issued 
the order on 06 May 1994 had no more legal competence to promulgate the 
same.â
[9]




Finally, the Court of Appeals upheld the assailed decision of 
the trial court 
on the civil aspect of the case, to wit: 




âx x x, the institution of a criminal action carries with it 
the civil action 
for the recovery of the civil liability arising from the offense 
charged. There 
was neither reservation nor waiver of the right to file the civil action
 
separately nor has one been instituted to the criminal action. Hence, 
the civil 
action for the civil liability has been impliedly instituted with the 
filing of 
the criminal case before respondent Judge. This is the law on the 
matter. The 
proposition submitted by petitioner that the court presided by 
respondent Judge 
had no jurisdiction over the property because it is located in Bulacan -
 outside 
the territorial jurisdiction of said court -does not hold water. Being a
 civil 
liability arising from the offense charged, the governing law is the 
Rules of 
Criminal Procedure, not the civil procedure rules which pertain to civil
 action 
arising from the initiatory pleading that gives rise to the 
suit.â
[10]




In the dispositive portion of its assailed decision, the Court 
of Appeals 
declared: 




âWHEREFORE, the instant petition not being sufficient in 
substance is hereby 
DENIED DUE COURSE and the case DISMISSED.â
[11]
 


In a resolution dated December 1, 1995, the Court of Appeals 
denied 
petitionerâs motion for reconsideration.
[12]
 


Hence, this petition. 


The Issues 


In her Memorandum, petitioner raises the following issues: 



âWHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT FINDING 
THAT THE PROSECUTION WAS 
DULY FURNISHED WITH COPY OF THE PETITIONERâS MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
WITH 
RESPECT TO THE DECISION ON THE CIVIL ASPECT OF CRIMINAL CASE NO. 
87-54773 (SIC) 
OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF MANILA, BRANCH 53.â 





âWHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING THAT
 THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT 
OF MANILA HAD JURISDICTION TO RENDER JUDGMENT ON THE CIVIL ASPECT OF 
CRIMINAL 
CASE NO. 87-57743 FOR FALSIFICATION OF PUBLIC DOCUMENT, INVOLVING A 
PROPERTY 
LOCATED IN BULACAN.â 





âWHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT FINDING 
THAT THE PETITIONER WAS 
DENIED DUE PROCESS WHEN THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF MANILA, BRANCH 53, 
RENDERED 
DECISION ON THE CIVIL ASPECT OF CRIMINAL CASE NO. 87-57743.â
[13]




The Ruling of the Court 

We grant the petition. 


When the accused is acquitted on reasonable doubt but is 
adjudged civilly 
liable, his motion for reconsideration of the civil aspect must be 
served not 
only on the prosecution, also on the offended party if the latter is not
 
represented by a private counsel. Moreover, if the trial court has 
jurisdiction 
over the subject matter and over the accused, and the crime was 
committed within 
its territorial jurisdiction, it necessarily exercises jurisdiction over
 all 
matters that the law requires the court to resolve. This includes the 
power to 
order the restitution to the offended party of real property located in 
another 
province. 


Absence of Proof of Service 


The first issue is whether petitionerâs motion for 
reconsideration dated 
February 7, 1994 complied with the mandatory requirements of Section 6, 
Rule 15 
on proof of service. Petitioner submits that the Court of Appeals erred 
in 
sustaining the trial courtâs finding that the City Prosecutor was not 
duly and 
timely furnished with petitionerâs motion for reconsideration of 
February 7, 
1994. 


Petitioner asserts that both copies of the motion for 
reconsideration were 
sent to the trial court and the City Prosecutor by registered mail on 
February 
10, 1994. Petitioner relies on jurisprudence that the date of mailing is
 the 
date of filing, arguing that the date of mailing of both motions was on 
February 
10, 1994. Petitioner maintains that the motion was properly filed within
 the 
15-day period, citing the registry return card which shows actual 
receipt on 
February 22, 1994 by the City Prosecutor of a copy of the motion. 



The Court of Appeals, noting that petitioner received a copy of
 the decision 
on January 28, 1994, stated that petitioner had until February 12, 1994 
to 
appeal the decision or file a motion for reconsideration. The Court of 
Appeals 
ruled that petitioner, by filing a motion for reconsideration without 
any proof 
of service, merely filed a scrap of paper and not a motion for 
reconsideration. 
Hence, the reglementary period of petitioner to appeal continued to run 
and 
lapsed after the 15-day period, making the trial courtâs decision final 
and 
executory. 


We agree with the Court of Appeals that petitioner patently 
failed to comply 
with the mandatory requirements on proof of service insofar as the 
public 
prosecutor is concerned. The Court has stressed time and again that 
non-compliance with Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Rule 15 is a fatal defect. 
The 
well-settled rule is that a motion which fails to comply with Sections 
4, 5, and 
6 of Rule 15 is a useless piece of paper. If filed, such motion is not 
entitled 
to judicial cognizance and does not stop the running of the reglementary
 period 
for filing the requisite pleading.
[14]




Section 6 of Rule 15 reads: 




âSEC. 6. - 
Proof of service to be filed
 with 
motions.
 â No motion shall be acted upon by 
the court, 

without proof of 
service
 of the notice thereof.â
[15]
 (Emphasis supplied) 



From the language of the rule, proof of service is mandatory. 
Without such 
proof of service to the adverse party, a motion is nothing but an empty 
formality deserving no judicial cognizance. 


Section 13 of Rule 13 further requires that: 




âSEC. 13. 
Proof of 
Service
. â x x x. If service is 
made by registered mail, proof shall be made by 
such
 affidavit and 
the registry receipt
 issued by the mailing 
office. The registry 
return card shall be filed immediately upon its receipt by the sender, 
or in 
lieu thereof the unclaimed letter together with the certified or sworn 
copy of 
the notice given by the postmaster to the addressee.â
[16]
 (Emphasis supplied) 



If service is by registered mail, proof of service consists of 
the 

affidavit of the person 
mailing
 and the 

registry receipt
, both
 of which must be appended to 
the motion. Absent one or the other, or worse both, there is no proof of
 
service. 


In the instant case, an examination of the record shows that 
petitioner 
received a copy of the trial courtâs decision of January 17, 1994 on 
January 28, 
1994. Within the reglementary period to appeal, petitioner filed on 
February 10, 
1994, by registered mail, a motion for reconsideration. However, 
petitioner 
failed to attach both the affidavit and the registry receipt to the 
motion for 
reconsideration as required by the Rules. 


The defect of the motion is apparent on its face. Petitionerâs 
motion for 
reconsideration was a mere scrap of paper as it did not contain the 
required 
proof of service. 


However, petitioner is contesting that part of the decision of 
the trial 
court finding him civilly liable even as he is acquitted from the 
criminal 
charge on reasonable doubt. This raises the issue of whether the public 
prosecutor is the only proper party to be served with petitionerâs 
motion for 
reconsideration. The present Rules do not require the accused to serve a
 copy of 
his motion for reconsideration on the offended party who may not be 
represented 
by a private counsel. The Rules require service only on the public 
prosecutor if 
the offended party is not represented by a private counsel. 


A judgment of acquittal is immediately final and executory and 
the 
prosecution cannot appeal the acquittal because of the constitutional 
prohibition against double jeopardy. However, either the offended party 
or the 
accused may appeal the civil aspect of the judgment despite the 
acquittal of the 
accused. The public prosecutor has generally no interest in appealing 
the civil 
aspect of a decision acquitting the accused. 


The acquittal ends the work of the public prosecutor and the 
case is 
terminated as far as he is concerned. 


The real parties in interest in the civil aspect of a decision 
are the 
offended party and the accused. Thus, any appeal or motion for 
reconsideration 
of the civil aspect of a decision in a criminal case must be served on 
the other 
real party in interest. If the offended party appeals or moves for 
reconsideration, the accused is necessarily served a copy of the 
pleading 
through his counsel. 


If the accused appeals or moves for reconsideration, a lacuna 
arises if the 
offended party is not represented by a private counsel. In such a 
situation, 
under the present Rules only the public prosecutor is served the notice 
of 
appeal or a copy of the motion for reconsideration. To fill in this 
lacuna in 
the present Rules, we require that henceforth if the accused appeals or 
moves 
for reconsideration, he should serve a copy of his pleading on the 
offended 
party himself if the latter is not represented by a private counsel. 
This is in 
addition to service on the public prosecutor who is the counsel of 
record of the 
State. 


In the instant case, the Court notes that petitioner did not 
serve a copy of 
her motion for reconsideration on the offended party who was not 
represented by 
a private counsel in the trial court. In the interest of justice, and 
considering that the present Rules are silent on the matter, it is only 
fair to 
give petitioner a period of five days from receipt of this decision 
within which 
to serve a copy of her motion for reconsideration on the offended party.
 


Trial courtâs jurisdiction over the civil aspect. 



Petitioner maintains that the Court of Appeals erred in finding
 that the 
trial court had jurisdiction to render judgment on the civil aspect of 
the 
criminal case. Petitioner asserts that the Manila trial court had no 
jurisdiction over the parcel of land in Bulacan which is outside the 
trial 
courtâs territorial jurisdiction. 


In upholding the trial courtâs jurisdiction, the Court of 
Appeals held: 




âBeing a civil liability arising from the offense charged, the 
governing law 
is the Rules of Criminal Procedure, not the civil procedure rules which 
pertain 
to civil action arising from the initiatory pleading that gives rise to 
the 
suit.â
[17]




We agree with the ruling of the Court of Appeals. 


Petitioner asserts that the location of the subject property 
outside the 
courtâs territorial jurisdiction deprived the trial court of 
jurisdiction over 
the civil aspect of the criminal case. This argument is contrary to the 
law and 
the rules. 


There are three important requisites which must be present 
before a court can 
acquire criminal jurisdiction. First, the court must have jurisdiction 
over the 
subject matter. Second, the court must have jurisdiction over the 
territory 
where the offense was committed. Third, the court must have jurisdiction
 over 
the person of the accused.
[18]
 In the 
instant case, the trial court had jurisdiction over the subject matter 
as the 
law has conferred on the court the power to hear and decide cases 
involving 
estafa through falsification of a public document. The trial court also 
had 
jurisdiction over the offense charged since the crime was committed 
within its 
territorial jurisdiction. The trial court also acquired jurisdiction 
over the 
person of accused-petitioner because she voluntarily submitted to the 
courtâs 
authority. 


Where the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and 
over the person 
of the accused, and the crime was committed within its territorial 
jurisdiction, 
the court necessarily exercises jurisdiction over all issues that the 
law 
requires the court to resolve. One of the issues in a criminal case is 
the civil 
liability of the accused arising from the crime. Article 100 of the 
Revised 
Penal Code provides that â[E]very person criminally liable for a felony 
is also 
civilly liable.â Article 104 of the same Code states that âcivil 
liability x x x 
includes restitution.â 


The action for recovery of civil liability is deemed instituted
 in the 
criminal action unless reserved by the offended party.
[19]
 In the instant case, 
the offended party 
did not reserve the civil action and the civil action was deemed 
instituted in 
the criminal action. Although the trial court acquitted petitioner of 
the crime 
charged, the acquittal, grounded on reasonable doubt, did not extinguish
 the 
civil liability.
[20]
 Thus, the Manila 
trial court had jurisdiction to decide the civil aspect of the instant 
case - 
ordering restitution even if the parcel of land is located in Bulacan. 



Consequently, while we find no reversible error in the decision
 of the Court 
of Appeals as to proof of service and the trial courtâs jurisdiction on 
the 
civil aspect, we remand this case for further proceedings in the 
interest of 
justice. 


WHEREFORE,
 petitioner is given 
five (5) days from receipt of 
this decision within which to serve a copy of her motion for 
reconsideration on 
the offended party. Let this case be remanded to the trial court for 
further 
proceedings.

 Docketed as Criminal 
Case No. 87-57743 in 
Branch 53 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila. 
[4]
 The trial court 
declared that petitioner 
held the parcel of land merely as trustee of the true surviving heirs of
 the 
registered owner. The trial court ordered petitioner not to encumber or 
dispose 
of the said property at the risk of incurring criminal liability. 
Finally, the 
trial court ordered the cancellation of the title in the name of 
petitioner and 
the issuance of a new title in the name of the heirs, upon reimbursement
 to 
petitioner of the P2,500.00 she paid to redeem the property.

 The
 last paragraph of Section 2, 
Rule 111 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure provides as follows: 
âThe 
extinction of the penal action does not carry with it extinction of the 
civil 
action. However, the civil action based on delict may be deemed 
extinguished if 
there is a finding in a final judgment in the criminal action that the 
act or 
omission from which the civil liability may arise did not exist.â This 
is 
substantially the same rule as in the 1985 Rules of Criminal 
Procedure.
