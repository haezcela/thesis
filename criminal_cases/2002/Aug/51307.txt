QUISUMBING, J.:




Petitioners assail the decision
[2]

  of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR. No. 14627, dated March 26, 
1997, which affirmed with modification the consolidated judgment dated 
January 29, 1994 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Kalibo, Aklan, 
Branch 4, in Criminal Cases Nos. 3322-23. The appellate court upgraded 
the conviction of petitioners Bernardo Taran, Victor de Juan, and 
Benedict Ureta in Criminal Case No. 3322 from homicide to murder and 
sustained the conviction of petitioner Benedict Ureta in Criminal Case 
No. 3323 for frustrated homicide. Before us, petitioners pray for 
acquittal.  


The antecedents of this petition are as follows: 


On March 25, 1991, two separate informations for murder and 
frustrated homicide were filed with the RTC of Kalibo, Aklan against 
herein petitioners. In Criminal Case No. 3322, Ureta, de Juan, and Taran
 were charged with murder allegedly committed as follows: 




That on or about the 30th day of November, 1990, in the 
evening, 
in Barangay Bugasongan, Municipality of Lezo, Province of Aklan, 
Republic of the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with deadly weapons 
consisting of a rifle and knives, conspiring, confederating and mutually
 helping one another, with evident premeditation, treachery, abuse of 
superior strenght (sic) and with intent to kill, did then and there 
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, stab and shoot one
 JOSE ROCEL FULGENCIO, thereby inflicting upon the latter physical 
injuries,â¦    


x x x 


as per Post Mortem Examination Report signed by Dr. 
Reynaldo P. 
Sucgang, Jr., Medical Specialist 1 of the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon 
Memorial Hospital, Kalibo, Aklan, hereto attached and made an integral 
part hereof, which physical injuries caused the death of said JOSE ROCEL
 FULGENCIO. 




CONTRARY TO LAW.
[3]
 


In Criminal Case No. 3323, the charge sheet for frustrated 
homicide filed against Ureta reads: 




That on or about the 30th day of November, 1990 in the 
evening, 
in Barangay Bugasongan, Municipality of Lezo, Province of Aklan, 
Republic of the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, while armed with a rifle, with
 intent to kill, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously
 attack, assault and shoot one SOCRATES FULGENCIO, thereby inflicting 
upon the latter physical injury, to wit: 


âGunshot wound, lateral aspect, proximal 3rd left thigh.â  



as per Medico Legal Report on Physical Injuries issued by 
Dr. 
Stevens N. Fuentes, M.D., Medical Officer III of the Dr. Rafael S. 
Tumbokon Memorial Hospital, Kalibo, Aklan, hereto attached and made an 
integral part hereof, the accused having thus performed all the acts of 
execution which would have produced the crime of Homicide as a 
consequence, but nevertheless, did not produce it by reason of causes 
independent of the will of the accused, that is, the timely and able 
medical assistance rendered to said SOCRATES FULGENCIO, which prevented 
his death. 




CONTRARY TO LAW.
[4]
 


When arraigned, petitioners pleaded not guilty. Since the two
 cases arose out of the same incident, they were tried jointly. 



The prosecution presented Socrates Fulgencio, Dr. Reynaldo 
Sucgang,
 and Dr. Stevens Fuentes as its witnesses. Socrates Fulgencio, who 
survived the homicidal attack, was the sole eyewitness to the crimes. 
The two doctors, employed at the Dr. Rafael Tumbokon Memorial Hospital 
in Kalibo, Aklan, had conducted the autopsy on the deceased, Jose Rocel 
Fulgencio, and had medically examined the surviving brother, Socrates 
Fulgencio. 


SOCRATES FULGENCIO declared that at about 7:00 P.M. of 
November 30,
 1990, he and his brother Jose Rocel Fulgencio, hereafter simply Rocel, 
were on their way home from the house of their aunt, Erna dela Cruz, in 
Bugasongan, Lezo, Aklan. When they passed the residence of Councilman 
Renato Leonardo, six men came out of said house. Of this group, Socrates
 recognized Isidro de Juan, Ely Leonardo, Nilo Cezar, and Armando Cezar.
 They surrounded Rocel, while Socrates merely stood aside. Moments 
later, petitioners Bernardo Taran and Victor de Juan arrived on board a 
motorcycle and joined the six men. Taran had a gun in his right hand, 
while de Juan had a knife tucked in his waistband. Moments later, 
Benedict Ureta and Rudolfo Taran also arrived. Ureta and Rocel had a 
brief altercation. Bernardo Taran then struck Rocelâs face with a gun, 
while de Juan stabbed Rocelâs stomach, and Ureta shot Rocel with a long 
firearm. A certain Rodel Sorio also struck Rocel with a bolo but 
Socrates did not see where Rocel was hit. Despite his wounds, Rocel was 
able to run for about five meters from his assailants before collapsing.
 Socrates helped Rocel to stand up but Ureta allegedly shot him 
(Socrates) in the thigh. Socrates fell and rolled away. When he looked 
back to where his brother was, Socrates saw three unidentified persons 
striking Rocel with their bolos. Socrates fled home. He asked for help 
from his sister Judy Grace and brother Cyril to bring Rocel to a 
hospital. Rocel died from the injuries he sustained. 


DR. REYNALDO SUCGANG testified that he conducted the 
post-mortem 
examination on Rocel Fulgencioâs cadaver. He found multiple stab wounds 
in the victimâs right chest and a gunshot injury. His findings were as 
follows: 




EXTERNAL FINDINGS: = Multiple stabbed (sic) wounds, right 
chest, Right upper Quadrant, left axillary area


 Hacking wound back & left Thigh 


GSW right thigh, thru & thru 


INTERNAL FINDINGS: = Penetrating wound at mid-liver 
(depth-4 
inch) with cut/severed arteries penetrating the right diaphragm with 
massive blood loss & blood clots. 


CAUSE OF DEATH: = Massive Blood Loss 


Stabbed wounds (02 points)
[5]
 




Dr. Sucgang further testified that the victim in Criminal 
Case No. 
3322, Rocel Fulgencio, also sustained a âcontusion hematoma right 
forearmâ and âcontusion hematoma right handâ among his injuries.
[6]
 


DR. STEVENS FUENTES testified in Criminal Case No. 3323 that 
he 
examined the injuries of Socrates Fulgencio. He found that Socrates 
sustained a gunshot wound on the âproximal third lateral aspect of the 
left thigh.â
[7]




The defense version of the incident was summed up by the 
Court of Appeals as follows: 




At around 8:00 oâclock, accused-appellant Benedict Ureta 
was at 
the house of Nelson CastaÃ±o in Bugasongan, Lezo, Aklan, when he heard a 
shot. He went outside and saw Rocel Fulgencio holding a gun. He accosted
 Rocel but the latter pointed the gun at him so he grabbed the gun and 
they grappled for possession. Accused-appellant Bernardo Taran arrived 
and held Rocel by the shoulders, pulled him backward and then jumped to 
the canal alongside the road. Benedict Ureta was able to get the gun 
from Rocel but the latter pulled out another gun and pointed it to the 
former. Benedict Ureta fired and retreated about 25 to 30 meters away. 
Rocel fell down but fired his gun at random five (5) times. At this 
juncture, Socrates Fulgencio was seen crawling towards Rocel. Socrates 
got the gun from Rocel, fired it once then ran away. Three unidentified 
persons then came and boloed (sic) Rocel who was lying on the road and 
then ran away towards Numancia. 


Shortly thereafter, accused-appellant Victor de Juan and 
Dioclesio Sabino arrived on a motorcycle coming from Numancia. They 
stopped when they saw a man lying on the road. They went near and 
recognized the man to be Rocel Fulgencio. There were several people 
there, among them were Leoncito Legaspi and Ely Leonardo. A tricycle 
arrived and Rocel was loaded on it. After the tricycle had left, Victor 
de Juan and Dioclesio Sabino went home.
[8]
 




The trial court convicted petitioners of homicide in Criminal
 Case 
No. 3322 and petitioner Ureta of frustrated homicide in Criminal Case 
No. 3323 but ruled out conspiracy among the petitioners. The decretal 
portion of its consolidated judgment reads: 




WHEREFORE, finding the accused BERNARDO TARAN in CRIMINAL 
CASE 
NO. 3322 GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as an accomplice to the crime of
 Homicide without aggravating or mitigating circumstances, he is hereby 
sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of TWO (2) 
YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of prision correccional as 
minimum to EIGHT (8) years and ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor as maximum 
and to indemnify the heirs of the victim Rocel Fulgencio the sum of 
FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) jointly with his other co-accused. 



Accused VICTOR DE JUAN is found GUILTY in the same case 
beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of Homicide without mitigating 
circumstance and he is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate 
penalty of imprisonment of EIGHT (8) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision 
mayor as minimum to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS and ONE (1) 
DAY of reclusion temporal and to indemnify the heirs of the victim Rocel
 Fulgencio the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) jointly with his
 other co-accused. 


Accused BENEDICT URETA is found GUILTY beyond reasonable 
doubt as
 an accomplice to the crime of Homicide in CRIMINAL CASE No. 3322 and is
 hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of TWO (2) YEARS, 
FOUR (4) MONTHS, and ONE (1) DAY of prision correccional as minimum to 
EIGHT (8) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor as maximum and to 
indemnify the heirs of the victim Rocel Fulgencio the sum of FIFTY 
THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) jointly with his co-accused. 


In CRIMINAL CASE NO. 3323, the accused BENEDICT URETA is 
found 
GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Homicide and 
is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment 
of TWO (2) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of prision 
correccional as minimum to EIGHT (8) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision 
mayor as maximum and to indemnity (sic) the victim Socrates Fulgencio 
the sum of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS (P20,000.00) as moral and compensatory 
damages. 


SO ORDERED.
[9]
 




Petitioners appealed their conviction to the Court of Appeals
 
contending that the trial court erred in condemning them solely on the 
basis of the uncorroborated testimony of the prosecutionâs eyewitness. 



On March 26, 1997, the Court of Appeals promulgated its 
decision, the dispositive portion of which reads: 




WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed decision with 
respect to Criminal case No. 3322 is hereby MODIFIED as to the nature of
 the offense committed and the degree of participation of each of the 
malefactors. As MODIFIED, We find accused-appellants Benedict Ureta, 
Victor de Juan and Bernardo Taran guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the 
crime of murder and are each sentenced to suffer an indeterminate 
penalty ranging from seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of 
Reclusion Temporal as minimum to 
Reclusion Perpetua

 as maximum. With respect to Criminal Case No. 3323, We affirm the 
findings of the court a quo. 


SO ORDERED.
[10]
 




In ruling that the killing of Rocel is murder, rather than 
homicide, the appellate court found that Rocelâs killing was attended by
 abuse of superior strength. Rocel was unarmed when attacked by 
petitioners, who not only acted in concert but were armed with dangerous
 weapons as well. The appellate court also found petitioners equally 
guilty as conspirators. 


Petitioners moved for reconsideration, but the appellate 
court denied their motion in its resolution of August 25, 1998.
[11]
 


Hence this petition, anchored on the following grounds: 



I 


THE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION AGAINST THE PETITIONERS WERE (sic)
 
RENDERED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AS PROSECUTION FAILED TO PRESENT
 SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO REBUT THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IN FAVOR OF 
THE ACCUSED-PETITIONERS, BASED AS IT IS ON THE INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY OF A
 POLLUTED LONE EYEWITNESS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ACCUSED PRESENTED A 
PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE PROVING THEIR LAWFUL DEFENSES, CONSISTING OF 
UNREBBUTED (sic) CONTRARY TESTIMONIES NOT ONLY OF THE PETITIONERS 
THEMSELVES BUT ALSO SEVERAL INDEPENDENT AND DISINTEREDTED (sic) 
EYE-WITNESSES. 


II 


THE COURT OF APPEALS AND THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED ERROR AS 
WELL AS
 GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION 
IN NOT AQUITTING (sic) PETITIONERS WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSOLIDATED 
CRIMINAL CASES.
[12]
 


As hereafter discussed, we find the instant petition without 
merit. 


Pertinent for our resolution of this petition is the issue of
 the 
sufficiency of the prosecution evidence, consisting mainly of the 
uncorroborated testimony of a single eyewitness, to convict petitioners 
beyond reasonable doubt. This matter hinges, in turn, on the question of
 the credibility of the eyewitness, Socrates Fulgencio. 


Petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals erred in 
affirming 
their conviction based on the suspect testimony of the sole prosecution 
eyewitness. Petitioners point out that no less than nine disinterested 
eyewitnesses of unquestioned candor, fairness, intelligence and 
truthfulness, had contradicted Socratesâ testimony. 


The Office of the Solicitor General, as counsel for the 
State, 
counters that there is no reason whatsoever to doubt the testimony of 
Socrates Fulgencio. Socrates steadfastly testified on the actual 
commission of the crime and positively identified its perpetrators. No 
ill motive could be imputed to him to falsely testify against 
petitioners. Nor would the fact that Rocel was his brother impel him to 
perjure and falsely implicate petitioners, for it is unnatural for a 
relative who is interested in seeking justice to accuse persons other 
than the real culprits. Further, Socrates could not possibly be mistaken
 as to petitionersâ identities for he knew them since childhood. Lastly,
 the denials by petitioners cannot prevail over the positive 
identification by the prosecution eyewitness. 


Petitionersâ contentions for their acquittal are far from 
persuasive. Note that the trial court found Socrates to be a credible 
witness, deserving of full faith and credence. Note likewise that the 
appellate court did not disturb the trial courtâs appreciation of 
Socratesâ credibility. It is doctrinal that the trial courtâs assessment
 of the credibility of a witness when affirmed by the Court of Appeals 
is entitled to great weight and respect.
[13]

 Petitioners fail to show any persuasive reason for us to depart from 
this doctrine, other than insisting that several witnesses for the 
defense contradicted Socratesâ version of the incident. However, 
credibility must be weighed not by the number of witnesses but by the 
quality of their testimonies. 


The inconsistencies referred to by petitioners in a 
last-ditch 
effort to demolish Socratesâ credibility concern only minor and 
collateral matters. They do not relate to the essential elements of the 
crime. For instance, it hardly matters where or from whom petitioner 
Ureta got hold of a gun. It is likewise immaterial whether petitioner de
 Juanâs shirt was tucked in or not. Petitioners harp on matters 
irrelevant to the elements of the crime. The alleged minor 
inconsistencies pointed out by petitioners are not grounds for 
acquittal.
[14]
 
Moreover, 
inconsistencies in the testimony of a prosecution witness with respect 
to minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance of 
his declarations or the veracity of his testimony, but rather, they 
enhance his credibility for they erase any suspicion that the testimony 
was contrived or rehearsed.
[15]
 


The records show that Socrates Fulgencioâs identification of 
petitioners as among the perpetrators of the crime is positive, 
categorical, and consistent. Socrates could not have been mistaken in 
his identification, as the OSG stresses, because he knew petitioners 
since childhood. Petitioners fail to show any ill motive for Socrates to
 falsely accuse them of the crime or to pervert the truth. Where there 
is no evidence to show any dubious or improper motive why a prosecution 
witness should bear false witness against the accused or falsely 
implicate him in a heinous crime, the testimony is worthy of full faith 
and credit.
[16]




As against the positive identification by Socrates Fulgencio 
of 
petitioners Taran and de Juan as among the assailants of Rocel, all that
 Taran and de Juan could offer is the defense of alibi and denial. Alibi
 is one of the weakest defenses, not only because it is inherently weak 
and unreliable, but more so because it can easily be fabricated and 
concocted. For alibi to prosper, one must not only prove that he was 
somewhere else when the crime was committed but must also show that it 
was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the 
crime.
[17]
 Their 
concocted 
alibi must fail. As to their defense of denial, it cannot prevail over 
the positive testimony of the prosecutionâs eyewitness. Between the 
self-serving denials of petitioners and their positive identification by
 eyewitness Socrates Fulgencio, the latter deserves greater 
credence.
[18]




The records show that petitioner Ureta claimed self-defense. 
When 
an accused invokes self-defense, the onus probandi is shifted to him to 
prove by clear and convincing evidence the elements of his 
defense.
[19]

 Three requisites must concur for a plea of self-defense to prosper: (1)
 unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to 
prevent or repel it; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part 
of the person defending himself.
[20]

 For unlawful aggression to be appreciated, there must be an actual, 
sudden, unexpected attack or imminent danger thereof, not merely a 
threatening or intimidating attitude.
[21]
 


We find none of the foregoing elements of self-defense 
present in 
this case. First, the trial court found that there was no unlawful 
aggression on the part of Rocel against Ureta, when the latter shot the 
former, following their brief altercation.
[22]

 Otherwise put, there was no actual or threatened attack against Ureta 
that the latter had to repel. Second, recall that Rocel was unarmed. 
Even assuming arguendo that Rocel had threatened to attack Ureta, the 
use of a gun by the latter to repel such an attack would not be 
reasonable. We must also point out that it is contrary to human 
experience and reason for an unarmed man to attack another who is armed 
with a gun, particularly where the latter had several armed companions. 
Third, the trial court found that there was no sufficient provocation on
 the part of Rocel before Ureta shot him.
[23]
 On this score, the appellate court sustained
 the findings of the trial court when it ruled out Uretaâs theory of 
self-defense.
[24]




We note that the autopsy report showed that Rocel did not die
 from 
the gunshot wound inflicted on him, but from multiple stab wounds. 
However, we also note that the Court of Appeals found that conspiracy 
among the petitioners was amply established. As shown in the testimony 
of Socrates Fulgencio, the petitioners acted in concert. Ureta shot 
Rocel, Taran pistol-whipped him, de Juan stabbed him, while several 
other unidentified persons struck him with bolos. All the foregoing acts
 showed a common purpose, interest, and design, thereby establishing a 
conspiracy among them. In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all, 
hence, it is not necessary that all the participants deliver the fatal 
blow.
[25]
 With 
conspiracy duly
 established, all the petitioners are guilty of murder for the death of 
Rocel Fulgencio. No error was committed by the appellate court in this 
regard. 


However, there is an error concerning the penalty imposed. 
Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, murder is punished by 

reclusion perpetua
 to death. Both are indivisible 
penalties. But there being no aggravating circumstance, the penalty 
imposable in this case is 
reclusion perpetua
.
 Moreover, aside from civil indemnity of P50,000, the heirs of the 
victim are entitled to the award of moral damages in the amount also of 
P50,000, pursuant to current jurisprudence, without need of further 
proof other than the fact of the victimâs death. 


As to the offense of frustrated homicide in Criminal Case No.
 3323,
 wherein petitioner Benedict Ureta alone is charged for gunshot injuries
 inflicted on complaining witness Socrates Fulgencio, we find 
petitionerâs defense of denial untenable. As found by Dr. Stevens 
Fuentes, the wound inflicted on Socrates was serious. Left unattended, 
the injury could have caused the death of the victim. It is quite ironic
 that petitioners would make it appear that Socrates was the attacker, 
allegedly using his fallen brotherâs weapon. Yet, as summed up by the 
CA, their defense clearly showed it was Ureta who was able to get 
Rocelâs gun. Moreover, if Socrates had attacked or shot at any one of 
the petitioners, why is it that none of them suffered any injury? The 
truth is only the brothers Rocel and Socrates were found with gunshot 
wounds, according to the medico-legal reports. We conclude that 
petitioner Uretaâs defense to the charge of frustrated homicide is a 
mere concoction, deserving no serious consideration. 


Settled is the rule that the testimony of a single witness, 
when 
credible and trustworthy, is sufficient to sustain a conviction, even in
 a charge of murder
[26]
 and 
surely also in a charge of frustrated homicide. As earlier stated, we 
find the testimony of Socrates Fulgencio for the prosecution 
straightforward, convincing and entitled to full faith and credit. The 
conviction of petitioner Benedict Ureta in Criminal Case No. 3323 was 
properly sustained by the appellate court. 


WHEREFORE,
 the petition is 
DENIED. The assailed 
decision dated March 26, 1997 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR. No.
 14627, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Petitioners BENEDICT URETA, 
VICTOR DE JUAN, AND BERNARDO TARAN are declared GUILTY of murder in 
Criminal Case No. 3322, and each is hereby sentenced to suffer the 
PENALTY of 
reclusion perpetua
. They are also 
ordered to pay 
jointly and severally the sum of P50,000 to the heirs of the victim, 
Jose Rocel Fulgencio, as civil indemnity and another sum of P50,000 as 
moral damages. Petitioner BENEDICT URETA is found GUILTY of frustrated 
homicide in Criminal Case No. 3323, and hereby sentenced to the 
indeterminate penalty of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day 
of prision correccional as minimum to eight (8) years and one (1) day of
 prision mayor as maximum. The order for him to pay the complaining 
witness, Socrates Fulgencio, the sum of P20,000 as compensatory damages 
for the latterâs injuries is upheld. No pronouncement as to costs.
