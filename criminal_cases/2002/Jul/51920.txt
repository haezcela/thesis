PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. HERMANO ANTIPOLO, BERNIE CABASAG, (AT LARGE), RICHARD ANTIPOLO, (AT

HERMANO ANTIPOLO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

PUNO, J.:


The
accused-appellant, HERMANO ANTIPOLO, and his co-accused Bernie Cabasag, Richard
Antipolo and Edjul Antipolo were charged with Murder before the Regional Trial
Court of Barili, Cebu, Branch 60.
[1]
 
The crime was allegedly committed as follows:
[2]


âThat on or about the 5
th

day of June, 1998, at 12:30 dawn, more or less, at Barangay Doldol,
Municipality of Dumanjug, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring,
confederating and mutually helping one another, with intent to kill, with 
treachery

and 
evident premeditation
, and 
taking advantage of superior strength
,
did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and
shoot thrice one Aniceto Bantoy 
with the use of a firearm of unknown caliber
,
hitting the latter on the different parts of his body which caused his death.


CONTRARY TO LAW.â


When arraigned,
Hermano Antipolo pled ânot guilty.â
[3]
 The others have remained at
large.  The trial of the
accused-appellant ensued.


The prosecution
evidence came chiefly from the accounts of Renante LaÃ±ojan and his mother,
Gregoria LaÃ±ojan, brother-in-law and mother-in-law, respectively, of the
victim, Aniceto Bantoy.


It appears that
in the evening of June 4, 1998, Aniceto Bantoy, Gregoria LaÃ±ojan, and Renante
LaÃ±ojan, attended the novena to commemorate the fiesta of 
barangay

Doldol, Dumanjug, Cebu. After the novena, they trekked toward the house of
Gregoria LaÃ±ojan.  On their way, they
stopped at the 
barangay
 hall to rest.  It was already 12:30 a.m. of June 5, 1998.


At that time,
five (5) men were drinking liquor at a store, about six (6) or seven (7) meters
away from the 
barangay
 hall.  The
group was composed of the accused-appellant, his co-accused and John Doe.  Gregoria and Renante LaÃ±ojan personally knew
the accused-appellant and his co-accused.
[4]
 Someone from the group asked the
victim and Renante to drink with them.  The victim and Renante approached them and declined the offer.  Thereafter, Jacinto
[5]
 Cabasag arrived and hugged the
victim.  He also told the victim not to
go home because they would drink Tanduay Rhum.  The victim, who was just visiting his in-laws for the fiesta, freed
himself from the hold of Jacinto Cabasag as he was a stranger to him.  The accused-appellant and his companions
then walked toward a road leading downhill, about four (4) or five (5) meters
away from the store.


The victim and
his in-laws headed for home, passing through the same route taken by the
accused-appellant.  For some reason, the
accused-appellantâs group stopped walking.  When the victim came closer to them, the accused-appellant suddenly drew
his firearm and shot him.  Renante, who
was behind the victim, saw that the first shot hit the left portion of the
latterâs chest.  The victim slumped on
the ground but was still fired upon by the accused-appellant.  The first bullet hit his thigh, the second
missed its target.  During the assault,
the companions of the accused-appellant hurled stones at the victim and
Renante.  Thereafter, they fled.
[6]


Gregoria LaÃ±ojan
managed to run to their house in Doldol, more or less, 700 meters away from the
crime scene.  She immediately reported
to her daughter, Flora Bantoy, the tragic fate of the latterâs husband.  They rushed back to the crime scene.  With the help of some relatives, Flora was
able to bring the victim to Barili District Hospital, but to no avail.  He was pronounced dead on arrival.  He was 25 years old.
[7]


Municipal Health
Officer Octavio Ortiz conducted an autopsy on the body of the victim.  His postmortem report
[8]
 showed the following findings:


âFINDINGS:


A.
  
Gunshot
wound No. 1 â 
Entrance is located at the left chest wall
, 1 cm. long, 1
cm. wide, 4 cms. from the midline, 8 cms. from the nipple, 17 cms. below the
clavicle, 17 cms. from the lateral border.  
Powder burns seen at the edge of the wound. 
 
Stomach and liver were perforated
â¦.  No exit wound is noted.


B.  Gunshot wound No. 2 â located at the inquinal area, 1 cm. long, 1
cm wide, 7 cms. from the midline, 7 cms. below the inquinal bone, 10 cms. from
the lateral border.  
Powder burns
seen at the edge of the wound.  Thigh
muscles were perforated.
  No exit
wound was noted.


CAUSE OF DEATH


1. Irreversible circulatory
collapse due to massive hemorrhage due to gunshot wound hitting the stomach and
liver.â


The defense was
a mere denial.


The
accused-appellant testified that on June 4, 1996, he went to 
barangay

Doldol to play billiards with his nephews, namely, accused Richard Antipolo,
Bernie Cabasag and Edjul Antipolo.  They
started playing at about 6:30 p.m.  After the game, they went to a store near the 
barangay
 hall and
had a drinking spree.  There were other
people in the vicinity, some were drinking liquor while others were just buying
some stuff from the store.


At past
midnight, there was an altercation among a group of drinkers in the
vicinity.  Jacinto Cabasag arrived and
pacified the victim by embracing the latter.  All of a sudden, there were three (3) bursts of gunfire.  The accused-appellant and his companions
took cover and ran.  He went straight to
his motherâs house in 
barangay
 Pancil.  The following day, he heard the news that somebody was killed in the
shooting incident.


A few days
later, the accused-appellant went to Mandaue to work.  He learned that he was an accused in the killing of the victim
when he was arrested on September 21, 1998.  On cross-examination, he declared that before the gunshots, he saw the
victim shaking the hands of the other group of people who were engaged in the
drinking spree.


Defense witness
Renato Escoreal, a resident of 
barangay
 Maigang, testified that he
engaged in a drinking spree with his 
barkada
 at 12:30 a.m. of June 5,
1996 near the area where the group of the accused-appellant was also
drinking.  The victim allegedly went
wild due to drunkenness and so Jacinto Cabasag restrained him.  After the victim freed himself from Jacinto
Cabasagâs hold, gunshots rang out.  The
accused-appellantâs group scampered. Escoreal said he did not see who shot the
victim.


After the trial,
the Regional Trial Court of Barili, Cebu, found the accused-appellant guilty of
the crime charged.  It held:
[9]


âThe defense of denial is just the
same as alibi.  It is a weak defense
that can easily be overturned by positive identification.  In the case at bench, the accused was
positively identified by the eyewitnesses of the prosecution who testified in a
candid, straightforward and spontaneous manner.


There is no showing that the
witnesses for the prosecution were motivated by revenge or ill-feeling.  No reason for them to testify against the
accused; they were just telling the truth.


JUDGMENT is therefore rendered
declaring the accused, Hermano Antipolo, GUILTY of the crime of Murder and he
is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to pay the
heirs of the deceased the sum of P50,000.00 as indemnity.


SO ORDERED.â


Hence the
appeal.  The accused-appellant assigns
these errors:


âI.


THE TRIAL
COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF MURDER
NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABSENCE OF COMPETENT AND SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT
THE SAME.


II.


THE TRIAL
COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER
AND IMPOSING THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF THE
QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY AND/OR EVIDENT PREMEDITATION TO QUALIFY
THE CRIME TO MURDER.â


The appeal lacks
merit.


The
accused-appellantâs defense was a bare denial.  Allegedly, he was at the crime scene, having a drinking spree with his
co-accused while the victim was with another group.  The victim went wild due to drunkenness and was then being
pacified by Jacinto Cabasag. Thereafter, gunshots rang out.  They dispersed.  The next day, he learned that somebody got killed in the
incident.


We are unconvinced
by the accused-appellantâs story.  His
denial of complicity in the crime cannot prevail over the positive testimony of
the prosecution witnesses.

Gregoria LaÃ±ojan
corroborated the essential points of the testimony of Renante LaÃ±ojan.
[12]


The testimonies
of Renante and Gregoria LaÃ±ojan deserve full faith and credit for there is no
showing that they were improperly motivated to testify falsely against the
accused-appellant.  Even the
accused-appellant declared he could not think of any reason why the prosecution
witnesses pointed to him as the assailant.
[13]


Renante and
Gregoria LaÃ±ojan are related to the victim.  Considering their close relationship, their natural instinct would be to
help bring the real culprit to justice.  To blame an innocent man for the killing of the victim would serve them
no purpose.


The information
charged that treachery and evident premeditation attended the killing.


Evident
premeditation requires proof of the following: (1) the time when the accused
decided to commit the crime; (2) an overt act manifestly indicating that he has
clung to his determination; and (3) sufficient lapse of time between the
decision and the execution to allow the accused to reflect upon the
consequences of his act.
[14]
 The records show that the
prosecution did not adduce any evidence to prove these elements.  What was established was that the victim and
his in-laws were just passing by at the place where the accused-appellantâs
group was drinking. They had a chance encounter.  There is no evidence adduced on when and how the
accused-appellant had planned the killing of the victim.  Nor is there proof offered to show how much
time had elapsed before the plan was executed.  Absent all these, evident premeditation cannot be appreciated against
the accused-appellant.
[15]


However,
treachery was sufficiently proven in the case at bar.  Treachery or 
alevosia
 exists when the offender commits any
of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods or forms in the
execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution,
without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might
make.
[16]


In the case at
bar, the attack against the victim was treacherous not only due to the
suddenness of its execution, but also due to the deliberateness of the mode
chosen.  The records show that the
victim had no inkling of the impending attack.  He was just walking along the road leading downhill when the
accused-appellant shot him.  The victim
had no opportunity to anticipate the imminence of his attack, nor was he in a
position to defend himself or repel the aggression because he was unarmed.  Moreover, he was shot on the chest, at close
range, as evidenced by the powder burns found around the victimâs gunshot
wounds.
[17]
 To ensure the success of his
criminal design, the accused-appellant fired at the victim twice although the
latter was already wounded and was helplessly sprawled on the ground.  Undoubtedly, the accused-appellant deliberately
and consciously adopted the means to ensure his criminal purpose without any
risk to himself.  The suddenness of the
attack without the slightest provocation from the victim who was unarmed and
had nary any opportunity to repel the aggression qualifies the crime with 
alevosia
.
[18]


Clearly, the
accused-appellant is liable for the crime of murder as the killing was done
with treachery.  The penalty for the
said crime under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, is 
reclusion
perpetua
 to death.  In the absence
of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the lesser penalty of 
reclusion
perpetua
 should be applied.
[19]


We now come to
the civil liability of the accused-appellant.  The trial court correctly awarded the sum of fifty thousand pesos (
P
50,000.00)
as civil indemnity to the heirs of the victim.  In addition, however, the accused-appellant should pay them the amount
of 
P
50,000.00 as moral damages for their sufferings which resulted from
the violent death of the victim.
[20]


IN VIEW
WHEREOF
, the
decision appealed from, finding the accused-appellant, HERMANO ANTIPOLO, guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of Murder in Criminal Case No. CEB-BRL-288, and
sentencing him to suffer 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay the legal heirs
of the victim, ANICETO BANTOY, the amount of 
P
50,000.00 as civil
indemnity, is AFFIRMED.  In addition,
the accused-appellant is ordered to pay the amount of 
P
50,000.00 as
moral damages.  Costs against the
accused-appellant.


SO ORDERED.
