THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS.
RENE ALMANZOR Y ROXAS, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




KAPUNAN, J.:


This is an automatic review of the Decision, dated March 15,
1996, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 66 of Makati City in Criminal Case
No. 94-3602 finding accused-appellant Rene Almanzor y Roxas guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of Forcible Abduction with Rape and sentencing
him to suffer the supreme penalty of death.


On the basis of the sworn complaint of Sally Roxas, the
Information charged accused-appellant with forcible abduction with rape
committed as follows:  


That on or about the 11
th
 day of March 1994, in the Municipality of Makati, Metro Manila,
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, with lewd designs, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously abduct, take and carry away the herein complainant
while walking along Makati Avenue, Ayala Center, Makati, Metro Manila near
Landmark Department Store on her way to Jollibee, Greenbelt Branch, where she
works as a service crew, by means of force, violence and intimidation, to wit:  by introducing himself as a Marikina police,
poking a handgun on the left side of the complainantâs body, and then pulling
her and forcing her to board inside the front passenger seat of the accusedâ
car and threatening to shoot her and brought her to a secluded area within
Makati, where said accused at gunpoint and intimidation, ordered herein
complainant to undress by taking off her T-shirt, pants and panty, and by means
of force, violence and intimidation, succeeded in having sexual intercourse
with her against her will.


Contrary to law.
[1]


At his arraignment, accused-appellant, with the assistance of
counsel, pleaded not guilty.


The prosecutionâs evidence, based mainly on the testimony of the
complainant, Sally Roxas, established the following:


On March 11, 1994, at 5:45 in the morning, Sally Roxas, then
seventeen (17) years old, was on her way to work in Jollibee Greenbelt in
Makati City.  She was new in her job as
she was hired only four days before.  She was walking along Makati Avenue in front of the Ayala Museum when a
car suddenly stopped beside her.  The
car was headed towards Pasay Road.  The
man who drove the car told Sally not to be afraid.  He introduced himself as a Marikina policeman showing her an
identification card.  At his query,
Sally gave him her name.  He initially
did not believe her but she showed him her Jollibee nameplate.
[2]


The man then told Sally to ride his car so he could take her to
her workplace.  Sally at first refused
since Jollibee Greenbelt was already close by.  However, the man poked a gun at her.  Fearing for her life, Sally obliged and boarded his car.  The man immediately drove on.  They passed by Jollibee Greenbelt and Sally
told the man that she would get off there but he just told her to shut up.
[3]


The man just kept on driving.  Sally did not shout for help because she was afraid as the man was
carrying a gun.  While the car was
moving, the driver ordered Sally to undress.  She refused and begged him to bring her to work.  The man told her not to be hardheaded and
poked his gun at her.  Sally could not
do anything but obey him.  She took off
her t-shirt and bra.  He then ordered
her to remove her pants and panty as well.
[4]


Thereafter, the man stopped the car.  Sally could not recall the exact place because at the time, she
had been in Makati for only a week.  She
described the place as sparsely populated and with buildings that are not so
tall.  The man removed his pants and
underwear.  He then reclined Sallyâs
seat and lay on top of her.  He spread
her legs and inserted his penis into her sexual organ.  Sally begged for his mercy but he continued
to poke his gun at her.  He said that it
would just take a short while.
[5]


After he was finished, the man moved back to the driver
seat.  Sally threatened to file a
complaint against him.  The man again
poked his gun at her saying, â
babalikan kita
.â  He instructed her to put on her clothes while he dressed up
also.  According to Sally, he was
wearing black pants and red polo shirt.  The man drove his car.  Just a
few minutes later, he slowed down the car and ordered Sally to get off.  Since he did not bother to stop the car,
Sally almost fell from the car.  Sally
tried to grab the identification card that he showed her but the man was able
to recover it.
[6]


Sally proceeded to her place of work because her cousin, Carlos
Abellanosa, also worked there.  It was
already 6:20 in the morning.  She was
sobbing as she told her cousin that she wanted to go home.  Abellanosa asked what was wrong but Sally
did not want to confide in him immediately because there were a lot of
people.  Upon the advice of her cousin,
Sally donned her uniform and did her work.  She found it difficult, however, to concentrate.
[7]


During their break time, Sally recounted to Carlos what happened
to her.  After telling their manager about
Sallyâs ordeal, she asked permission to go home.  The manager instructed Sally to have herself examined by a
doctor.  Sally and Abellanosa went to
the San Lorenzo Medical Clinic but the doctor there told them that he could not
examine Sally as they did not have the proper equipment.  He referred her to the Ospital ng Makati.
[8]


Sally went home and narrated to her two aunts what she had been
through.  Her two aunts accompanied her
to the Ospital ng Manila but they were told that the hospital did not have the
necessary equipment to conduct the physical examination on Sally.  They were instead given a referral slip to
the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).  Since it was already late in the afternoon, Sally decided to go to the
Makati Police Station and report the incident.  After she gave her account of what happened, Sally was given a referral
slip to the Camp Crame Crime Laboratory.
[9]


The following day, or on March 12, 1994, submitted herself to a
physical examination at the Camp Crame.  She was examined by Dr. Jesusa Vergara.  She was advised to give a physical description of the suspect so his
cartographic sketch could be made.  The
Philippine National Police (PNP) cartographer furnished Sally with a copy of
the sketch.
[10]

On March 22, 1994, she was fetched by a policeman who informed her that the
authorities had arrested a man who looked similar to the one in the
cartographic sketch.  They proceeded to
the police station and there she was made to identify the suspect from among
the line up of around five (5) men.  Sally identified accused-appellant as the one who raped her.  Thereafter, she executed the affidavit and
filed the complaint against him.
[11]


When he testified, Abellanosa confirmed that when Sally reported
to work on March 11, 1994, she was crying and that during their break, she
confided to him that she was raped that morning by an unidentified man.  


Dr. Vergara, the medico-legal officer who examined Sally, made
the following findings in her report:


GENITAL


There is abundant growth of pubic hair.   Labia majora are full, convex and gaping with the abraded labia
minora presenting in between.  On
separating the same disclosed an abraded posterior fourchette and an elastic,
fleshy-type and a congested hymen, with deep healed laceration at 7 oâclock.   External vaginal orifice offers moderate
resistance to the introduction of the examining index finger and the
virgin-sized vaginal speculum.  Vaginal
canal is narrow with prominent rugosites.  Cervix is normal in size, color and consistency.  xxx
[12]


When she took the witness stand, Dr. Vergara explained that the
âdeep healed laceration at 7 oâclockâ found in Sallyâs 
labia majora

meant that she already had a previous sexual intercourse.  Further, the  âabrasion on the 
labia majora
,â âthe abrasion on the
posterior fourchette and congestion on the hymenâ indicated that there was a
forcible entry of a hard blunt object into Sallyâs sexual organ within
twenty-four (24) hours prior to the date of examination.
[13]


For his part, accused-appellant interposed denial and alibi.  He testified that he was a managing
consultant at the John Clemens Consultancy.  He lived with his mother in Leon Guinto, Malate, Manila.  On March 11, 1994, he woke up at 6:30 in the
morning and had breakfast.  He took a shower
and then got dressed.  He left the house
at 7:15 in the morning to go to the Hyatt Regency Hotel where he was attending
a two-day seminar being conducted by their company.  The seminar started the day before, March 10, 1994, and he was a
trainor thereat.
[14]


Outside their house and before he got inside the car (a red
Nissan Sentra 1988 model issued to him by his employer), accused-appellant met
their neighbor, Mrs. Alice Guiamoy and her son Vincent.  He greeted them. Going to the Hyatt,
accused-appellant took Taft Avenue, turned right at the Manila Sanitarium and
proceeded to Buendia.  He turned left
when he reached Roxas Boulevard and drove straight to the hotel.  He arrived there before 8:00 in the morning.
The seminar ended at 6:30 in the evening of the same day.
[15]


In the morning of March 22, 1994, on his way to the UPCB to
attend a seminar there, accused-appellant stopped by the gasoline station in
Zobel Roxas Street in Makati.  He
instructed the attendant to fill the tank. Two men in civilian clothes approached
him and asked if his name was Rene Almanzor.  Accused-appellant responded in the affirmative.  He was then told that he had to go to the
police station because there was a complaint against him.  Accused-appellant initially refused but a
policeman suddenly boarded his car so accused-appellant had to obey him.
[16]


He was ordered to drive to the Makati Police Station.  Accused-appellant pleaded to be allowed to
go to his office but the policeman said that they had to go straight to the
police station.   He was informed that
there was a complaint against him.  Later in the evening, Sally arrived at the police station.  Accused-appellant, together with five (5)
other men, was then made to stand in a line up.  Sally singled out accused-appellant as the man who raped her.
[17]


On cross-examination, accused-appellant admitted that aside from
Sally, at least two (2) other women had filed similar criminal complaints
against him.  Maritess Magsino filed a
complaint for acts of lasciviousness against accused-appellant before the
Regional Trial Court, Branch 136 of Makati City.  Suzette de Montano, on the other hand, likewise filed a
complaint for rape against accused-appellant and which case was pending before
the trial court in Manila.  Like Sally,
these women pointed to accused-appellant as their assailant.
[18]


Alice Guiamoy, accused-appellantâs neighbor, testified that at
6:30 in the morning of March 11, 1994, she was outside her house cleaning.  While she was doing her chore, she saw
accused-appellant step outside their house.  He greeted Guiamoy and asked her â
kumusta po kayo
?â  Accused-appellant went back inside their
house.  A few minutes later, Guiamoy saw
accused-appellant ride his car to go to work.
[19]

Another neighbor, Ma. Veronica Villamil, similarly testified that she heard the
engine of accused-appellantâs car being revved-up at around 6:30 in the morning
of March 11, 1994.  She later saw
accused-appellant driving out of their compound at around 7:00 in the morning
of the same day.
[20]


After the prosecution and defense presented their respective
evidence, the trial court rendered judgment finding accused-appellant guilty of
forcible abduction with rape and imposing upon him the supreme penalty of
death.  The dispositive portion of the
trial courtâs decision reads:


IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered finding Rene
Almanzor y Roxas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of forcible
abduction with rape and the Court hereby sentences Rene Almanzor y Roxas to
suffer, taking into consideration the absence of a mitigating or aggravating
circumstances and Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Article
335 of the same code, as amended, the penalty of Death and to pay Sally Roxas
the sum of 
P
50,000.00 as liquidated damages, 
P
50,000.00 as moral
damages and 
P
50,000.00 as exemplary damages.


SO ORDERED.
[21]


Through his 
counsel de oficio
, accused-appellant
subsequently filed his appeal brief alleging as follows:

V


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE
DEFENSE OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT AS A MERE ALIBI.


VI


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE
COMPLEX CRIME OF FORCIBLE ABDUCTION WITH RAPE WAS COMMITTED IN THIS CASE.
[22]


In determining the guilt of the accused in rape cases, the Court
is guided by the following considerations: (a) that an accusation of rape can
be made with facility; it is difficult to prove, but more difficult for the
person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (b) that in view of the intrinsic
nature of the crime which usually involves two persons, the testimony of the
complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) that the evidence
for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed
to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence of the defense.
[23]

The credibility of the complainant is, therefore, of vital importance, for in
view of the peculiar nature of rape, conviction or acquittal of the accused
depends almost entirely upon the word of the private complainant.
[24]


Accused-appellant primarily assails the testimony of Sally, the
complainant in this case.  At the
outset, he (accused-appellant) impugns Sallyâs positive identification of him
as her assailant.  Specifically,
accused-appellant assails the police line-up where he was identified by the
complainant claiming that police line-ups are inherently unreliable as they are
âpeculiarly riddled with innumerable dangers and variable factors.â
[25]

Moreover, the identification of accused-appellant during the police line-up is
allegedly inadmissible in evidence being a fruit of an illegal arrest and
violative of accused-appellantâs constitutional right to counsel.
[26]


Accused-appellant likewise points to alleged inconsistencies and
improbabilities in the prosecutionâs evidence.  The alleged inconsistencies are:


1.
  
In her sworn statement,
complainant narrated that she was forced to enter the car of accused-appellant
after the latter alighted from his car and pushed her inside.  In her direct testimony, however,
complainant averred that accused-appellant never alighted from the car during
the abduction;
[27]


2.
  
In her sworn statement,
complainant alleged that she was raped in a parking space located at the Ayala
Complex in Makati.  When she took the
witness stand, complainant could no longer recall where the alleged rape took
place.
[28]


Accused-appellant opines that the manner by which he allegedly
abducted and raped complainant is incredulous.  It is allegedly impossible to believe that, as recounted by complainant,
accused-appellant was able to commit all the acts that he allegedly did, 
e.g.
,
he conversed with complainant, showed her his Marikina police I.D., poked a gun
at her, forced her to ride the car, continued driving, ordered her to undress,
parked his car, removed his pants and brief, reclined the passenger seat, lay
on top of complainant and raped her, in a matter of less than twenty (20)
minutes.
[29]


It is allegedly hard to imagine that the rape could take place
inside a car where it would be difficult to consummate the sexual act given the
cramped space.  Likewise, Makati City,
where the abduction and rape supposedly took place, is such a heavily populated
area that complainant could not have been sexually abused there without being
noticed by many people.
[30]

Accused-appellant harps on the fact that complainant did not tell her cousin
about her ordeal immediately after it happened.  Such conduct allegedly runs counter to the natural reaction of an
outraged maiden despoiled of her honor.
[31]

Finally, there is allegedly no evidence on record to show that complainant put
up any resistance to accused-appellant, shouted for help or even tried to flee
the car.


The foregoing arguments proffered by accused-appellant fail to
persuade.


Accused-appellantâs allegation with respect to the conduct of the
police line-up is futile.  That he was
without counsel at the time of the police line-up does not render the same irregular
or invalid.  The guarantees of Section
12(1), Article III of the 1987 Constitution, or the so-called Miranda rights,
may be invoked only by a person while he is under custodial investigation.  Custodial investigation starts when the
police investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but
has begun to focus on a particular suspect taken into custody by the police who
starts the interrogation and propounds questions to the person to elicit
incriminating statements.  A police line-up
is not part of the custodial investigation; hence, the right to counsel cannot
yet be invoked at this stage.
[32]


It appears from the record that accused-appellant was not under
custodial investigation when he was brought to the Makati police station.   The police did not, as yet, interrogate him
or elicit incriminating statements from him.  He was brought to the police station to be presented, along with other
men, to Sally and to be identified by her.  The presence of counsel at that stage was not therefore necessary.


Moreover, it has been held that âin resolving the admissibility
of and relying on out-of-court identification of suspects, courts have adopted
the totality of circumstances test where they consider the following factors, 
viz
:  (1) the witnessâ opportunity to view
the  criminal at the time of the
crime;  (2) the witnessâ degree of
attention at that time; (3) the accuracy of any prior description given by the
witness; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the identification,
and (5) the suggestiveness of the identification procedure.â
[33]


Clearly, in this case Sally had the opportunity to take a good
look at accused-appellant when the crime was committed.  He approached her and introduced himself to
her as a policeman.    He coerced her into riding his car.  He brought her to a vacant lot and there
raped her while inside the car.  Under
the circumstances, Sally was unlikely to have forgotten his face.  Further, she could not have mistaken him
for another man.


It must be stressed that in convicting him for the crime charged,
the trial court did not rely solely on Sallyâs identification of
accused-appellant as her assailant during the police line-up.  Rather, the trial court found Sallyâs
testimony in court worthy of credence.  Sallyâs testimony, including her identification of accused-appellant,
was positive, straightforward and categorical:

ATTY. PEREZ:


Then, after asking your I.D. card from you,
what did you do?

) that I ride his car for him to bring me to Jollibee in
order to prove that I was not lying.


ATTY. PEREZ:


What else did he do after that?


WITNESS:


He poked a gun at me because I was then
near the door of his car and I could not do anything but to ride his car.


COURT:


You testified earlier that when the accused
stopped his car beside you, you were on the right side of the car.  Now, you testified later on that he pulled
out his gun.  You mean to say he
remained seated on the left side of his car?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


COURT:


Is it not that during that time, there were
already some people going to their work?


WITNESS:


No people were around at that time, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Just for the record, Your Honor.  I just want to make it of record that the
witness is crying while testifying.


COURT:


Proceed.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Now, Sally, after getting inside the car of
the accused, what happened?


WITNESS:


He drove his car.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After driving his car, what happened?


WITNESS:


We passed by the Jollibee Greenbelt and I
told him that Iâll alight there.


ATTY. PEREZ:


What was his response, if any?


WITNESS:


He told me not to be noisy and that I stop
talking and just to follow his orders if I still wanted to live.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After telling you that, what did you do, if
any?


WITNESS:


I could do nothing since he was poking his
gun at me and he kept on driving his car and I didnât know the place anymore.


ATTY. PEREZ:


During the time that you were inside the
car of the accused, did you shout for help?


WITNESS:


No, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Why did you not shout for help?


WITNESS:


I was afraid because he was carrying a gun.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Will you be able to describe the car that
was then being driven by the accused, Sally?


WITNESS:


I cannot remember what kind of car was
that.


ATTY. PEREZ:


How about the car window of the car?


WITNESS:


It was tinted, sir.


COURT:


How about the color, do you still remember?


WITNESS:


No, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


When the accused told you to shut up and
poked his gun at you, what did you do after that?


WITNESS:


I kept quiet and then he ordered me to
undress.


COURT:


Where was the car at that time?


WITNESS:


I donât know what street was that.


COURT:


Do you think it was still in Makati?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


COURT:


How long had he been driving the car when
he told you to undress?


WITNESS:


15 minutes, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


So, after telling you to undress, did you
follow what he told you?


WITNESS:


No, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


What did you do, if any, after that?


WITNESS:


I begged him to bring me in my place of
work because I will be late for my work.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After telling him that, what did you do, if
any?


WITNESS:


He told me not to be hard headed and poked
his gun at me and there was nothing that I could do but to undress.


COURT:


You mean to tell that you undressed inside
the car?


A.
    
Yes, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


When he told you to undress, what you were
then wearing at the time?


WITNESS:


I was wearing T-shirt and pants.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After telling you to undress, what
happened?


WITNESS:


I undressed because he poked a gun at me.


COURT:


What part of your dress did you take off?


WITNESS:


My T-shirt, sir.


COURT:


About your pants?


WITNESS:


I didnât want to put off my pants at first,
sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After taking off your T-shirt, what
happened?


WITNESS:


He asked me to remove my bra.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Did you remove your bra when he told you to
remove your bra?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After removing your bra, what happened
next?


WITNESS:


He ordered me to remove my pants.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Did you remove your pants?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir because he was poking a gun at me.


COURT:


When he asked you to undress, first with
your T-shirt, then with your bra then with your pants, was the car moving, was
he driving or the car was parked?


WITNESS:


The car was moving, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After removing your pants, Sally, what else
did you do?


WITNESS:


He told me to remove my panty, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Did you remove your panty?


WITNESS:


Yes, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After removing your panty, what happened,
Sally?


WITNESS:


He stopped the car.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Would you be able to recall what place or
part in Makati did he stop the car?


WITNESS:


No, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Why canât you remember the exact place
where he stopped the car?


WITNESS:


Because I have never been in those streets,
sir, because I have been in Makati for one week only.


ATTY. PEREZ:


By the way, Sally, please tell the Court
exactly where were you seated during the time that you were inside the car of
the accused?


WITNESS:


Beside the driverâs seat.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After the accused stopped his car, what
happened?


WITNESS:


He took off his pants together with his
brief.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After the accused took off his pants and
brief, what happened?


WITNESS:


He hold [sic] something in the seat so that
the seat will slide down.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After the accused held something in the
passengerâs seat, what else did he do, if any?


WITNESS:


He lied on top of me.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Before lying on top of you, Sally, you said
that the accused held something on the passengerâs seat to make it slide
downwards a little, what else did he do on the passengerâs seat, if any, aside
from that?


WITNESS:


He held the back portion of the passengerâs
seat so that it will recline a little.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After reclining the passengerâs seat a
little, what else did he do?


WITNESS:


He lied on top of me, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After lying on top of you, what did the
accused do?


WITNESS:


He spread my two legs.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After the accused spread your two legs,
Sally, what did he do?


WITNESS:


He inserted his penis inside mine, sir.


COURT:


While he was doing this on top of you, what
did you do?


WITNESS:


I was asking for his mercy.


COURT:


What was his reply?


WITNESS:


He was poking his gun at me and told me
that it will just take a short while.


ATTY. PEREZ:


Would you be able to recall, Sally, how
long more or less was the accused lying on top of you?


WITNESS:


5 minutes, sir.


ATTY. PEREZ:


After the accused inserted his penis inside
yours while poking his gun at you, what else happened?


WITNESS:


I was asking for his mercy, sir.


COURT:


After that what happened?


WITNESS:


He kept on pointing his gun at me.


COURT:


Then, what happened?


WITNESS:


After he was through (â
pagkatapos niyang labasan
â), he returned to his seat.


COURT:


About you, what did you do?


WITNESS:


I was crying, sir.  I told him that I will file a complaint.


COURT:


What was his reply?


WITNESS:


He poke his gun at me and told me â
babalikan kita
.â

Thus, the in-court identification made by Sally was more than
sufficient to establish the identity of accused-appellant.  Granting 
arguendo
 that there were
irregularities in the conduct of the police line-up, as claimed by
accused-appellant, the same did not foreclose the admissibility of the 
independent
in-court identification
.
[35]

Sally had absolutely no improper motive to implicate accused-appellant.  In fact, she had not met accused-appellant
until that fateful day of March 11, 1994 and did not even know his name until
he was apprehended.  The absence of
ulterior motive in implicating the accused further bolsters the credibility of
the complainant.
[36]


The inconsistencies pointed out by accused-appellant are, to the
mind of the Court, inconsequential.  The
perceived inconsistencies between Sallyâs sworn statement and testimony on the
matter of whether accused-appellant alighted from his car when he accosted
Sally along Makati Avenue and where exactly in Makati  the rape took place do not detract from her credibility as a
witness.  Neither inconsistencies on
trivial matters nor innocent lapses affect the credibility of a witness.  On the contrary, they may be considered
badges of veracity or manifestations of truthfulness on material points in the
testimony.  Put in another way, minor
inconsistencies even tend to strengthen rather than weaken the credibility of a
witness because they erase any suspicion of rehearsed testimony.
[37]


That there were discrepancies between Sallyâs affidavit and her
testimony is not at all unusual.  The
infirmity of affidavits as a species of evidence is a common occurrence in
judicial experience.  Affidavits are
generally not prepared by the affiants themselves but by other persons who used
their own language in writing the statements.  Being 
ex-parte
, they are almost always incomplete and often
inaccurate, but these factors do not denigrate the credibility of
witnesses.  As such, affidavits are
generally considered to be inferior to testimony given in court.
[38]


Contrary to accused-appellantâs contention, the Court does not
find it improbable that the rape was committed inside a car just parked in a
lot in Makati City, a heavily populated area.  The presence of people nearby does not always deter rapists from
committing their odious act.
[39]
 As
the Court had aptly observed in previous rape cases - 


x  x  x  The evil in man has no conscience.  The beast in him bears no respect for time and place, driving him to
commit rape anywhere â even in places where people congregate such as parks,
along the road side, within school premises, and inside a house where there are
other occupants.  Rape does not necessarily
have to be committed in an isolated place and in fact be committed in places
which to many would appear to be unlikely and high-risk venues for sexual
advances.
[40]


Moreover, that accused-appellant chose to perpetrate his lustful
act inside the car is not quite unbelievable.  Sexual intercourse in the cramped space of a car while perhaps
uncomfortable is not improbable.
[41]
 Time
and again the Court has ruled that lust is no respecter of time and place.
[42]


Accused-appellant faults the complainant for allegedly failing to
offer any resistance.  One of the
essential elements of forcible abduction with rape, 
i.e.
, the acts must
be against the will of the complainant, was thus allegedly not proven. This
contention is untenable.  Accused-appellantâs use of the gun provided sufficient intimidation to cow
Sally into submitting to his lewd deeds.  The Court has laid down the rule as follows:


The test is whether the threat or intimidation produces a
reasonable fear in the mind of the victim that if she resists or does not yield
to the desires of the accused, the threat would be carried out.  Where resistance would be futile, offering
none at all does not amount to consent to the sexual assault.  It is not necessary that the victim should
have resisted unto death or sustained physical injuries in the hands of the
rapist.  It is enough if the
intercourse takes place against her will or if she yields because of genuine
apprehension of harm to her if she did not do so.  Indeed, the law does not impose upon a rape victim the burden of
proving resistance.
[43]


In this case, accused-appellant kept on poking his gun at Sally
from the time when he ordered her to board his car up to the time when he
molested her.  Sally testified that she
could not cry for help because she was afraid as accused-appellant was carrying
a gun.  Her failure to offer a tenacious
resistance cannot thus be construed as consent but was borne out of genuine
fear for her life.


All told, accused-appellant miserably failed to destroy the
credibility of the complainant.  In view
of Sallyâs positive identification of accused-appellant as her assailant, his
alibi must fail. Alibi is one of the weakest defenses.
[44]

For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must establish not only that
he was somewhere else when the crime was committed but also that it was
physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the
time it was committed.
[45]

Accused-appellant claimed that he was in his house in Malate, Manila at the
time of the commission of the rape.  Said place is just a few minutes away from Makati City, the 
locus
criminis
.  The distance between
these two places did not render it impossible for accused-appellant to be at
the scene of the crime.  Accordingly,
his alibi must necessarily fail.


The crime committed, however, is not the complex crime of
forcible abduction with rape.  Forcible
abduction is absorbed in the crime of rape if the real objective of the accused
is to rape the victim.
[46]
 Th
facts on record clearly show that accused-appellantâs intent was to have carnal
knowledge with the complainant.  Hence,
the crime committed is simple rape.


The rape was committed with the use of a deadly weapon, a gun,
for which Republic Act No. 7659 prescribes the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua

to death.  There being neither
aggravating nor mitigating circumstance shown, accused-appellant should only be
sentenced to 
reclusion perpetua
, not death.


WHEREFORE
, the Decision, dated March 15, 1996, of the
Regional Trial Court, Branch 66 of Makati City in Criminal Case No. 94-3602 is
hereby MODIFIED.  Accused-appellant Rene
Almanzor y Roxas is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape,
as defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.  The penalty imposed on him is REDUCED to 
reclusion
perpetua
.  The damages awarded by
the trial court are hereby AFFIRMED.


SO ORDERED.
