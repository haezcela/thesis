PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. CANDIDO SOLOMON Y MARQUEZ, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




KAPUNAN, J.:




For automatic review is the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Zamboanga 
City, Branch 16,
[1]
 finding appellant 
Candido Solomon y Marquez guilty of five (5) counts of rape and imposing upon 
him five (5) death penalties. 


Except as to the date of commission of the crime, the five (5) complaints 
filed in these cases are similarly worded. The complaint filed in Criminal Case 
No. 14114 reads: 




That on or about June 16, 1995, in the City of Zamboanga, Philippines, and 
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, by 
means of threats and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously, have carnal knowledge of his own step-daughter, the undersigned 
CHARLYN FERNANDEZ y ANGELES, 15 years of age, against her will. 


Contrary to law.
[2]


The complaints in Criminal Cases Nos. 14115 to 14118 allege that the crime of 
rape was perpetrated against the same complainant four more times on July 5, 
1995,
[3]
 July 10, 1995,
[4]
 August 3, 1995,
[5]
 and August 12, 1995.
[6]
 


Upon arraignment, the accused, herein appellant Candido Solomon y Marquez, 
pleaded not guilty to each charge of rape.
[7]
 


Complainant Charlyn Fernandez
[8]
 was 
born on October 22, 1982 to spouses Felizardo and Julia Fernandez. The couple 
had five other children with ages ranging from eleven to twenty-five years. In 
1985, the couple separated. 


Soon thereafter, Charlynâs mother started living together with appellant. At 
the time of Charlynâs testimony, Julia had borne appellant five children: Pilar 
(7), twins Fernando and Angeline (5), Valentino (3), Robert (1), and Carding (5 
months). Pilar and Fernando have passed away. 


During the time material to these cases, Charlyn was living with appellant, 
Julia, the coupleâs three surviving children, and Charlynâs full-blood siblings, 
Felizardo, Jr. and Joven. They lived in a one-room nipa house with stairs 
leading to the lumber floor where the family slept. Their nearest neighbor lived 
around 300 meters away. 


Charlyn was at home when the first alleged rape took place at around 1:00 
p.m. on June 16, 1995. She and her half-brothers, three year-old Valentino and 
one year-old Robert, were sleeping when she felt someone on top of her. That 
person turned out to be appellant. He was holding her right shoulder as his left 
hand removed her panty, having first succeeded in peeling off her shorts while 
she slept. Charlyn struggled and kicked. Frightened, she cried and repeatedly 
shouted, âNo ma ya Pang!â (âPang, do not do it!â) 


After taking off Charlynâs panty, appellant knelt near Charlynâs feet and 
inserted his right index finger into Charlynâs vagina, pushing and pulling it 
(âta tucha-tuchaâ) inside her for some time. Charlyn tried to stand up but 
appellant pushed her down. He assured her that he would ânot inflictâ pain on 
her. After removing his shorts and briefs, appellant spread Charlynâs legs and 
inserted his penis into her vagina. He told Charlyn, âNo man alboroto. Si man 
alboroto tu, ay mata yo contigo.â (âDo not make any noise. If you will make 
noise, I will kill you.â) Charlyn felt appellantâs penis inside her vagina and 
experienced pain as appellant moved âup and down.â Charlyn pushed and kicked him 
but he proved too heavy for her. It was the first time Charlyn experienced 
sexual intercourse and her vagina bled. 


Charlyn did not know if appellant ejaculated but he stood up, put on his 
briefs and shorts, and went out of the house. Charlyn sat up and cried. Her 
brothers, who awoke as appellant inserted his finger into her sex organ, were 
also crying. 


The second rape took place less than a month later, on July 5, 1995, at about 
1:00 p.m. Charlyn was again sleeping on the floor with her brothers Valentino 
and Robert when she felt someone on top of her. Appellant was trying to remove 
her shorts and panty with his left hand. His other hand held her forearm. 
Charlyn pushed and kicked him but he pressed her down. He warned her, âDo not 
keep on moving because [I] will choke [you].â Charlyn cried, â
Pang, no ma ya 
Pang
!â Appellant knelt by her feet and removed his shorts and briefs with 
one hand and pressed her down with the other. Charlyn cried and tried to stand 
up. Appellant then lay on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. 
While Charlyn did not see appellantâs penis, she felt its size inside her. As 
appellant performed the sexual act, Charlyn again cried out, â
No ma ya, 
Pang
!â Appellant answered, âDo not keep on moving because I will not 
inflict any pain on you.â After completing the sex act, appellant sat beside 
Charlyn and put on his briefs. Charlyn sat by the corner and cried. Appellant 
warned her not to report the incident to her mother otherwise he would kill all 
of them. He then went out of the house. Charlynâs brothers remained sleeping and 
did not witness what happened. 


The third rape occurred on July 10, 1995. Charlyn was at home putting her 
brothers Valentino and Robert to sleep when appellant arrived and asked Charlyn 
for a cake of soap. After Charlyn handed him one, appellant left and Charlyn 
went to sleep on the floor beside her brothers. About thirty minutes later, 
Charlyn felt someone on top of her. Appellant had returned and was pressing her 
arm with his hand. His foot also pressed against hers. She cried, 
âNo ma ya, 
Pang
! You are always doing it to me.â Appellant released her arm and used 
the hand he was holding it with to remove Charlynâs panty. He knelt by her feet 
and removed his shorts and briefs. His right hand pressed Charlyn down to 
prevent her from standing. Appellant then began to mount her as Charlyn cried 
and tried to push him away. Despite her struggles, appellant succeeded in 
inserting his penis into Charlynâs vagina. He told her not to push him as he was 
not inflicting pain upon her. Charlyn felt pain as appellant performed âup and 
downâ motions. She cried, âNo ma ya, Pang.â Afterwards, appellant stood up, got 
dressed, and went out of the house. Charlyn sat up and cried. 




Robert and Valentino were awake when the incident took place.


The horrors Charlyn underwent in the hands of appellant did not end that day. 
Appellant would have his way with Charlyn two more times. 


Charlyn and her brothers were sleeping on the floor of their house in the 
afternoon of August 3, 1995. At around 4:00 p.m., Charlyn was again startled to 
find her stepfather on top of her. She kicked him, not wanting to be raped 
again. She pushed him away and cried to no avail. His left hand removed her 
panty as his other hand pressed down on her, preventing her from standing up. 
Appellant removed his shorts and briefs. He placed himself on top of her, 
inserted his penis into her vagina, and moved up and down. Charlyn felt her 
vagina ache. She tried to push him away but he was too heavy for her. Satisfied, 
appellant stood up and walked away. Her brothers again witnessed what happened. 



On August 12, 1995, Charlyn again was left to care for her brothers Valentino 
and Robert. Charlyn was in the midst of slumber when appellant mounted her. He 
told her not to make any noise so as not to awaken her brothers. Charlyn 
shouted, âNo ma ya, Pang!â Appellant held her two arms and pressed her against 
the floor. He knelt up and removed his short and briefs as his other hand 
pressed down her chest, preventing her from standing up. He removed her shorts 
and panty, inserted his penis into her vagina, and moved up and down. She cried 
as she felt pain in her vagina. Thereafter, he stood up, got dressed and left 
her lying in tears. This time, her brothers had not awakened to see Charlyn 
raped. 


On each occasion that she was raped, Charlynâs mother was in the market, 
selling tuba. She did not tell her mother about the rapes because she was afraid 
that appellant would carry out his threat to kill them should she report the 
incidents.
[9]
 


Charlyn, on the witness stand, said she could recall the exact dates when she 
was raped since she made an effort to remember them. She also remembered the 
time the rapes occurred because she and her brothers usually took their naps at 
the same time in the afternoon.
[10]


Unable to bear appellantâs molestations any longer, Charlyn left home for 
Tugbungan in September 1995. Charlyn asked Juliaâs permission to work as a maid 
in the home of Dr. Allan Navarro, a cousin of Julia. 


Charlyn revealed to her Kuya Allan that appellant raped her. Allan, in turn, 
told Julia about the sexual abuse that Charlyn suffered in the hands of 
appellant. On March 15, 1996, Julia visited Charlyn and confronted her. The 
latter admitted that appellant indeed raped her. 


Subsequently, Julia reported the alleged rape incidents to Barangay Captain 
Bing Ungab, who in turn reported the matter to the police. In the afternoon of 
April 15, 1996, the police fetched Charlyn and appellant and brought them to the 
police station, where Charlyn executed a written statement.
[11]
 She also submitted to a physical 
examination, which revealed that she was seven months pregnant. The police then 
brought Charlyn to the Department of Social Welfare and Development, where she 
stayed for a month. 


Charlyn noticed that her belly was bulging sometime in March 1996 while she 
was staying with Allan Navarro. Subsequently, Charlyn delivered a baby boy at 
the Zamboanga Medical Center. She gave the baby to Luis Acejaas, her brotherâs 
employer, because she could not afford to buy milk for him. She was sure that 
appellant sired her baby because he was the only one who ever had sexual 
intercourse with her. 


Charlyn, before the rape incidents, had been closer to appellant than to her 
own father. She called him âPapaâ and described him as a âgood stepfatherâ to 
her. She said she had no idea why he raped her.
[12]
 She denied that she filed the complaint 
because her pregnancy had become evident.
[13]
 


Charlynâs mother Julia testified she and her husband Felizardo separated in 
1985. That same year, appellant asked Juliaâs father permission to live with 
Julia. Julia and appellant did not marry because appellant himself was married. 
Appellant and his wife had nine (9) children of their own. Appellant was a tuba 
gatherer. To complement appellantâs occupation, Julia engaged in the sale of the 
native liquor two kilometers away from their house in Cawit. She would start 
selling tuba in the morning and return home between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. everyday. 



When Allan informed her of Charlynâs pregnancy, Julia confronted her 
daughter. Charlyn told her that it was her âstepfatherâ who impregnated her. 
Julia brought Charlyn to her sister Lydiaâs house. Charlyn confided to Lydia 
that she was pregnant with appellantâs child. 


At home in Cawit, Julia asked appellant why he impregnated Charlyn. Appellant 
cried and asked her forgiveness. He explained that things âsimply happenâ and 
pleaded that they settle the matter. Julia told him she âcould not do anything 
because there is a law.â Apprehensive of what Charlynâs brother might do to 
appellant, Julia decided to complain to the barangay captain, who encouraged her 
to settle the matter among them. Nevertheless, the barangay captain still 
reported the matter to the police.
[14]




Inspector Diosdado Apias testified on the investigation conducted after the 
police brought appellant to the police station.
[15]
 He confirmed that a certain kagawad 
accompanied Charlyn and Julia to the police, that Charlyn signed the complaint, 
that PO2 Imlan referred the case to SPO2 Concepcion for investigation, and that 
the police took appellant into custody.
[16]
 


Dr. Rodolfo Valmoria, PNP Medico-Legal Officer of the Philippine National 
Police, conducted Charlynâs physical examination. He prepared Medico-Legal 
Report No. M-134-96
[17]
 dated April 16, 
1996 stating:

CONCLUSION: 


Subject is of non-virgin state physically. 
Pregnancy compatible 7-8 
months. 


Testifying in court, Dr. Valmoria stated that the various hymenal lacerations 
indicated that the subject had engaged in âseveral sexual contact[s].â He 
estimated the subjectâs last menstrual period to be either August or September 
1995.
[18]
 Dr. Valmoria did not find any 
external physical injuries on Charlynâs body.
[19]
 


The defense presented appellant, 55, as its only witness. Candido Marquez 
admitted that he had sexual intercourse with Charlyn on several occasions but 
claimed that he âdid not forceâ himself on Charlyn. 


One time, appellant intentionally touched Charlynâs breast as he got the baby 
Charlyn was carrying. Charlyn did not protest. He repeated the act on several 
other occasions but each time Charlyn did not get mad and just smiled at him. 
Appellant realized that she would not complain should he initiate sexual 
relations with her. 


On June 16, 1995, at around 10:00 p.m., appellant was drying copra at the 
coconut kiln with Charlyn and Felizardo, Jr. Junior was at a distance, piling 
coconut husks when Charlyn picked up an old galvanized iron sheet and placed it 
on top of an old truck. Appellant was watching her over the coconut pile when 
Charlyn called him. He did not mind her at first. Charlyn then got the radio 
from Junior, brought it to the truck, and turned down the volume. She invited 
him to come to her, âPang, aqui ya lang kita hunto dormi.â (âPang, weâll sleep 
here together.â) By then, Junior was sleeping on a pile of coconut husks. When 
appellant went to Charlyn, she said, âPang, aqui lang kita dos.â (âPang, weâll 
stay here together.â) He lay down beside her in a supine position. She turned to 
him and placed her left leg (tanday) over his private part (na demiyo pututoy). 
Ten minutes later, she started moving her leg upward. Appellant started to 
entertain âsecond thought[s]â as his penis hardened. Since Charlyn did not 
complain when he touched her before, appellant took a chance and asked her to 
remove her shorts. Charlyn obliged. Appellant then unzipped his shorts. They 
engaged in sexual intercourse for around twelve minutes âin a side view 
position,â facing each other. 


Appellant and Charlyn again had sexual intercourse in Upper Cawit on July 5, 
1995, at around 10:30 a.m. Appellant was then peeling coconuts with Charlyn and 
her brother Jovit. Thirsty, appellant told Jovit to fetch water. Charlyn then 
got a sack, spread it on the ground, and lay down. After ten minutes, appellant 
got tired and sat down beside her. Charlyn touched his left side with her left 
hand. It occurred to him that Charlyn again wanted to experience what happened 
between them by the coconut kiln so they had sexual intercourse. 


Appellant and Charlyn engaged in their third sexual encounter on July 10, 
1996 while in the house of a certain Pendong. Appellant arrived at around 11:00 
a.m. and instructed Charlyn to cook the fish he had brought home. After taking 
their lunch, Valentino, Robert and Angeline went down the house to play. 
Appellant and Charlyn were seated on the bench when she asked him what time her 
mother would arrive. He told her that she would come home late in the afternoon. 



Appellant then touched Charlynâs breast. Charlyn simply smiled and did not 
protest. Appellant told her to close the door and asked her if she would like to 
have sex with him. She replied by closing the main door. Upon appellantâs 
invitation, Charlyn entered the room. Appellant and Charlyn kissed. She obliged 
when appellant asked her to remove her shorts. Appellant also started to 
undress. As they were lying down, she embraced him and opened her legs. 
Appellant continued to kiss Charlyn as they engaged in coitus, her legs on the 
back of his thighs. Charlyn moved her head âjust like in the moviesâ as 
appellant caressed her. Like their first coitus, it was Charlyn who experienced 
orgasm first. âConsidering [appellantâs] age,â they had sex for only twelve 
minutes. 


The fourth sexual intercourse occurred on the third of August 1995. Appellant 
arrived home at 4:00 p.m. and found Charlyn seated on the floor, folding 
clothes. She asked if appellant wanted to change his shorts. Charlyn looked 
intently at him as he took off his shorts. Appellant reached for the new pair of 
shorts held by Charlyn, but she pulled it back jokingly. He thought that there 
was âmaliceâ in her because pulling back the shorts forced him to sit down 
beside her. Appellant asked her why she did that but Charlyn just smiled. She 
held his shoulder and lay down. Appellant told her to remove her skirt and the 
girl complied. He told her that since she was willing to remove her skirt, 
surely, she could also remove her panty. Again, she obliged. Appellant took off 
his briefs and they engaged in sexual intercourse. She moved her head around and 
emitted a sound that manifested pleasure. Charlyn âejaculatedâ first; her sex 
organ was wet. She and appellant had sex for ten minutes only because he was in 
a hurry and had to go somewhere else. He said he did not need to intimidate her 
because he had been âusing her already.â 


On August 12, 1995, at 10:00 a.m., Valentino and Robert were in the river, 
more or less 200 meters away from Pendongâs house. Charlyn came into the house. 
She had just returned from the river where she washed the clothes and took a 
bath. She went inside the room and removed her clothes. Appellant looked at her 
and remarked, âWhy are you already burlisque (sic)?â Charlyn just smiled and the 
two exchanged looks. Appellant approached her and placed his arm around her. 
Charlyn was looking at appellant as if she wanted to be kissed and appellant 
kissed her. She did not resist. Appellant told her to lie down as he removed his 
shorts. Fearing that the children might come up the house any time, appellant 
left his briefs clinging to his leg. She held the back of his head and they had 
sexual intercourse. Once again, he noticed that she âejaculatedâ ahead of him 
because when he touched her private part, it was âslippery.â
[20]
 


On rebuttal, Charlyn refuted appellantâs testimony that she had sex with him 
at the tapahan.
[21]
 She claimed that she 
and her siblings never slept there. Charlyn reiterated that appellant forced her 
to have sexual intercourse and denied that she had an orgasm. She said that she 
did not know what an orgasm was.
[22]
 


The defense presented appellant on sur-rebuttal. He maintained that the house 
where he allegedly raped Charlyn was demolished in 1992, before the supposed 
rapes took place.
[23]
 


After trial, the RTC rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which 
reads: 




WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused CANDIDO SOLOMON y MARQUEZ GUILTY BEYOND 
REASONABLE DOUBT of the crimes of Rape defined and penalized under Article 335 
of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act No. 7659, 
committed against his stepdaughter, Charlyn Fernandez y Angeles, and sentences 
him as follows: 


In Criminal Case No. 14114, to suffer the penalty of DEATH and its accessory 
penalties, in the manner provided by law; 



In Criminal Case No. 14115, to suffer the penalty of DEATH and its accessory 
penalties, in the manner provided by law; 

In Criminal Case No. 14116, to suffer the penalty of DEATH and its accessory 
penalties, in the manner provided by law; 

In Criminal Case No. 14117, to suffer the penalty of DEATH and its accessory 
penalties, in the manner provided by law; 

In Criminal Case No. 14118, to suffer the penalty of DEATH and its accessory 
penalties, in the manner provided by law; and 

To pay the offended party, Charlyn Fernandez y Angeles, moral damages of 
P50,000.00 in each of the five cases or a total of P250,000.00 and exemplary 
damages in the amount of P25,000.00 in each of the five (5) cases or a total of 
P175,000.00, and to pay the costs. 


Let the complete records of these cases be forwarded to the Supreme Court for 
automatic review and judgment as provided by law. 


SO ORDERED.
[24]
 


Appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding him guilty because 
the prosecution evidence is insufficient to overcome the constitutional 
presumption of innocence. He cites various reasons for this conclusion. First, 
it is highly improbable that the five rapes were committed in such an identical 
manner. Moreover, her failure to escape after the first assault indicates that 
she consented to the sexual intercourse. Second, if indeed the victim struggled, 
kicked and pushed appellant during the assaults while she was in a supine 
position, it is âincredibleâ that she âdid not sustain external injuries.â 
Third, it is inconsistent with human experience that the victimâs brothers would 
either just sleep through the rapes or just watch what was happening without 
putting up a defense for their half-sister. Fourth, the victimâs delay of nine 
months in reporting the crimes rendered the charge of rape doubtful. Finally, 
there was no threat or intimidation in the commission of the alleged crimes. 
Complainantâs admission that appellant did not have a weapon and that he was 
âkindâ to her âonly shows that no amount of force or intimidation was employedâ 
by him and that complainant consented to the sexual intercourse. 


Appellantâs contentions boil down to the issue of credibility. As a rule, 
this Court does not disturb the factual findings of the trial court. It gives 
these great weight and respect since the trial court had the opportunity to 
observe the demeanor of the witnesses during the trial. Thus, where there is no 
showing that the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts 
or circumstances of weight and substance which could affect the result of the 
case, there is no reason to accord a contrary treatment to the credibility of 
prosecution witnesses and their testimonies.
[25]
 


In this case, the trial court stamped full faith and credence on the 
complainant as a witness and on her testimony. The trial court found âno reason 
to doubt her candor and sincerity, and the credibility of her testimony that she 
was raped by her stepfather.â
[26]
 


Indeed, a rural girl barely thirteen years of age,
[27]
 who reached only the third grade,
[28]
 who associated bomba films with war 
pictures,
[29]
 and who had no idea where 
babies come from
[30]
 could not have the 
guile to accuse appellant, whom she described as a âgood stepfather,â of rape. 
The defense did not successfully establish any motive on her part to impute such 
grave crimes upon appellant. In the face of this omission by the defense, her 
testimony should be accorded full credence.
[31]
 in another rape case involving a victim 
who was twelve years and six months old, the Court said: 




x x x the declarations on the witness stand of rape victims who are young and 
immature deserve full credence (People v. Bernaldez, 294 SCRA 317 [1998]). 
Succinctly, when the offended parties are young and immature girls from the ages 
of twelve to sixteen, courts are inclined to lend credence to their version of 
what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability but also the 
shame and embarrassment to which they would be exposed by court trial if the 
matter about which they testified were not true (People v. Clopino, 290 SCRA 432 
[1998]). In addition, we take cognizance of the trial courtâs observation on the 
segment of the Filipino society to which the victim belongs - almost illiterate, 
having attended school up to the third grade only, and so poor that she had to 
go to a neighborâs house to watch television, yet one who values her virginity 
which like a âmirror, once dropped and broken . . . can no longer be pieced 
together . . . not ever,â this being âtrue among the Filipino folks [to which] 
complainant belonged, poor and helpless, everything is entrusted to God.â
[32]
 


Complainantâs credibility cannot therefore be doubted. Her straightforward 
revelation of her sexual ordeal shows no other intention than to obtain justice 
for the wrong committed by appellant against her. Indeed, her mother first 
objected to the filing of charges against appellant. Complainant also knew that 
appellant might be sentenced to death. Notwithstanding that knowledge, and over 
her motherâs initial objections, she testified against him, praying that the 
death sentence be meted upon appellant. What he did to her, she said, she would 
âcarr[y] forever.â
[33]
 


That complainantâs testimony regarding the manner by which she was raped, 
i.e., she was asleep when appellant would start to sexually abuse her, was 
âuniformâ or âidentical,â does not diminish her credibility. Indeed, it is 
easily explained by the daily routine that appellantâs second family had 
adopted. By his own admission, appellant was a coconut farm worker who had all 
the opportunity to be alone with the complainant once his common-law wife had 
left to sell tuba. Men are creatures of habit and are bound to adopt a course of 
action that has proven to be successful. As appellant was able to fulfill his 
lustful designs upon complainant the first time, it comes as no surprise that he 
would repeat the horrific acts when the circumstances obtaining in the first 
rape again presented themselves


Complainantâs youth partly accounts for her failure to escape appellantâs 
lust. A young girl like complainant cannot be expected to have the intelligence 
to defy what she may have perceived as the substitute parental authority that 
appellant wielded over her. That complainant had to bear more sexual assaults 
from appellant before she mustered enough courage to escape his bestiality does 
not imply that she willingly submitted to his desires. Neither was she expected 
to follow the ordinary course that other women in the same situation would have 
taken. There is no standard form of behavior when one is confronted by a 
shocking incident. Verily, under emotional stress, the human mind is not 
expected to follow a predictable path.
[34]
 


That the prosecution did not prove that complainant suffered external 
injuries is easy to explain. Complainantâs physical examination was conducted 
around eight (8) months after the last rape incident; hence, scratches, 
abrasions or hematomas were no longer manifest on complainantâs body. 


Appellantâs observation of the âincredibleâ behavior displayed by 
complainantâs two half-brothers, his own sons, who witnessed the sexual assaults 
thrice and slept through them twice, has no merit. The two boys were mere 
toddlers who would have no idea that their father was committing rape before 
their very eyes. Neither could they be expected to defend their twelve-year old 
half-sister against their own father. As the Solicitor General keenly observed: 



No legal conclusion may be made from the fact that at certain times 
complainantâs younger brothers were awakened and witnessed the rapes and, at 
other times, they did not. In People v. Faigano x x x the Court observed that 
the fact that the victimâs 4-month old son and 3-year old niece were not 
awakened during the rape is simply normal because of their tender age. It noted 
that â[o]ne may suppose that children sleep more soundly than grown-ups and are 
not easily disturbed by the gyrations and exertions of adults in the night.â 
That they did not come to the aid of their sister nor relate to their kin what 
they saw was hardly surprising. To be sure, these children had no inkling that 
what they were witnessing was a hideous crime against the chastity and the 
person of their sister. The concept of rape is beyond the comprehension of these 
children. With their limited knowledge, it is safe to infer that what they only 
knew then was that their sister was crying and their stepfather was making her 
cry. Whether they knew she needed their assistance at that moment was not only 
difficult to determine, but also impossible to expect. Their failure to relate 
the incident to anybody was hardly surprising, since it was only Charlyn 
Fernandez who was with them most of the time. In fact, she had to stop schooling 
to take care of them (TSN, January 9, 1997 [2:00 p.m.], p. 28). Their mother 
usually arrived home late in the day, at times, did not even spend the night 
with them. Even if these children [had] fantastic memories, they [had] 
practically no one to relate to other than Charlyn Fernandez herself.
[35]
 


The prosecutionâs failure to present the two toddlers as corroborative 
witnesses is not fatal to its cause. Under Section 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of 
Court, all criminal actions shall be prosecuted under the direction and control 
of the prosecutor. The defense, therefore, may not dictate to the prosecution 
the choice of its witnesses.
[36]
 
Moreover, the children may be disqualified as witnesses by reason of their 
mental capacity or immaturity.
[37]
 In any 
case, the sole testimony of the victim is sufficient basis for conviction in 
rape, a crime usually committed in seclusion.
[38]
 


It is inaccurate for appellant to claim that complainant reported her 
repeated defilement only after nine months. The undisputed prosecution evidence 
is that complainant revealed that appellant had raped her to Dr. Allan Navarro 
in September 1995, less than a month from her last rape on August 15, 1995. At 
any rate, her hesitation may be attributed to her age, the moral ascendancy of 
the accused over her, and his threats against her.
[39]
 In this case, note should be taken of the 
following circumstances vis-Ã -vis the complainantâs alleged delay in reporting 
the crimes: she was a rural lass a few months short of thirteen years of age; 
she had limited education; her fear that her mother would get mad at her should 
she reveal her sexual molestation by appellant; she considered the culprit as 
her stepfather to whom she was closer than her own father; and, finally, his 
threats to kill everyone in the family should she report the repeated commission 
of the crime of rape against her 


Appellant also makes capital of complainantâs admission that when the crimes 
were committed he was not carrying a weapon with which to intimidate her. She 
also said that he was kind to her. 


Article 335, as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act No. 7659, states in 
part: 




Art. 335. When and how rape is committed. - Rape is committed by having 
carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: 


1. By using force or intimidation; 


x x x x x x x x x x 




The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed 
with any of the following attendant circumstances: 


1. When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a 
parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity 
within the third civil degree, or the common law-spouse of the parent of the 
victim; 


x x x x x x x x x. 


Rape may thus be committed with the use of either force or intimidation. In 
this case, each of the five complaints alleges that the crime was committed âby 
means of threats and intimidation.â There was, therefore, no need to prove the 
use of force. What the prosecution needed to prove was the presence of 
sufficient intimidation to cow complainant to submit to appellantâs lustful 
desires. 


The prosecution successfully established that appellant employed intimidation 
when he had sexual intercourse with complainant on June 16, 1995. As appellant 
inserted his penis into complainantâs vagina, he warned her, âNo man alboroto. 
Si man alboroto tu, ay mata yo contigo.â (Do not make any noise. If you will 
make noise, I will kill you.)
[40]
 


Intimidation was also present when appellant had carnal knowledge of 
complainant on July 5, 1995. As appellant was removing complainantâs panty, she 
pushed and kicked him. Complainantâs struggling prompted appellant to warn her 
not to keep on moving, otherwise he would choke her.
[41]
 


On the other three occasions, appellant used his weight to press against 
complainant and render her resistance futile. There is no evidence that 
appellant uttered any threatening words or that he brandished any weapon. 
Apparently, appellant employed force rather than intimidation to subdue 
complainant into submission on those three occasions. 


The trial court appears to have considered the âoverbearing moral influenceâ 
that appellant exercised over complainant as a substitute for intimidation.
[42]
 In People vs. Alberto Chua,
[43]
 however, this Court held that the moral 
ascendancy of the accused in incestuous rapes, alone, does not lead to the 
conclusion that intimidation was present. Neither do threats against the victim 
not to report the rape, by themselves, constitute sufficient intimidation. 


There is nothing in Chennyâs testimony that shows how appellant intimidated 
her into giving him her body. Intimidation breaks down the victimâs moral 
resistance and makes her submit to the evil in order to escape what she 
conceives to be a greater evil. There is no proof of what greater evil Chenny 
had to escape that made her submit to her fatherâs carnal desires. The mere fact 
that appellant is her father and therefore exercises moral ascendancy over his 
daughter cannot ipso facto lead this Court to conclude that there was 
intimidation. There must be some evidence of the intimidation employed on the 
victim as to indubitably show how vitiated the victimâs consent was to the 
violation of her womanhood. After all, rape is committed against or without the 
consent of the victim. The very first time appellant violated Chenny, he did not 
use any weapon to threaten her into submission. Neither did appellant threaten 
her with blackmail or words of terror. He warned her not to tell her mother 
because if she did, heir mother will surely kill him and she will land in jail 
and no one will take care of Chenny and her younger brothers and sisters. These 
words of doom may give the reason why Chenny did not report the incident or 
incidents to her mother, her aunt or other people; but they do not show how they 
brainwashed her into giving in to appellantâs lustful desires. The doomsday 
scenario is not per se sufficient to establish the psychological terror that 
made the girl submit to her father. The court cannot rely on presumptions of 
moral ascendancy, for in this new century where more change, it could well be 
that in certain cases, the traditional moral ascendancy of a parent over 
children is a myth. Presumptions of moral ascendancy cannot and should not 
prevail over the constitutional presumption of innocence. Force or intimidation 
is an element of the crime of rape. There must, therefore, be proof beyond 
reasonable doubt that the victim did not resist her defloration due to the moral 
ascendancy of the accused. 


As the prosecution alleged but failed to prove that appellant employed 
intimidation in the rapes that transpired on July 10, August 3 and 12, 1995, he 
must be acquitted of such charges. 


As regards the rapes occurring on June 16 and July 5, 1995, the penalty of 
death imposed for said crime by the trial court is reduced to 
reclusion 
perpetua
 in each case. 


To warrant the imposition of the death penalty, the information must clearly 
allege and the evidence must prove beyond reasonable doubt the existence of the 
twin conditions of minority of the victim and her relationship to the accused. 
This requirement rests on the constitutional principle that an accused is 
entitled to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusations against him. 
As such, he can only be convicted of the crime alleged in the complaint or 
information and duly proven during trial.
[44]
 


The complaints in this case erroneously allege that appellant was her 
âstepfather.â The word âstep,â when used as a prefix in conjunction with a 
degree of relationship, indicates relationship by affinity.
[45]
 A stepdaughter is thus the âdaughter of 
oneâs legal spouse by a previous marriage.â
[46]
 Corollarily, as used in the law defining 
and penalizing the crime of rape, a âstepfatherâ is the legal husband of the 
victimâs mother by virtue of a marriage subsequent to that of which the victim 
is the offspring.
[47]


The allegation that appellant was complainantâs stepfather is belied by Julia 
Fernandezâs testimony that she was not married to appellant and that she was 
only living in with him.
[48]
 Appellant 
also testified that he was married to a certain Arsenia Noblesala.
[49]
 Appellant was therefore but a common-law 
spouse to Julia. While a common-law husband is subject to punishment by death 
for raping his common-law wifeâs daughter, the death penalty cannot be imposed 
on appellant because the relationship alleged in the complaints is different 
from that actually proven.
[50]
 Appellant 
may only be found liable for the crime of âsimpleâ rape, which is punishable by 

reclusion perpetua
.
[51]
 


Moral damages are automatically awarded in rape cases involving young girls 
between thirteen and nineteen years of age without need of any proof
[52]
 considering the immeasurable havoc 
wrought on their feminine psyche
[53]
 by 
the crime. 


The trial court failed to award civil indemnity in complainantâs favor. Civil 
indemnity is mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape; it is automatically 
imposed upon the accused without need of proof other than the fact of the 
commission of the rape.
[54]
