PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROMEO GERON, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




KAPUNAN, J.:




Before this Court for automatic review is the decision of the 
Regional Trial 
Court of Caloocan City, Branch 128, finding Romeo Geron guilty beyond 
reasonable 
doubt of the crime of rape and imposing upon him the penalty of 
death.


The case originated from an Information that read:


That on or about the month of July 1996 in Caloocan City, Metro
 Manila, and 
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, with 
lewd designs, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
repeatedly 
lie and have sexual intercourse with the undersigned complainant EMILY 
GERON y 
TORENTE, a minor of 15 years of age, against the latterâs will and 
without her 
consent, and said accused being then the father of said minor.


Contrary to law.
[1]


On March 3, 1997, Geron was arraigned and pleaded Not Guilty to
 the 
accusation.
[2]
 
However, on July 29, 1997, 
the accused was re-arraigned. This time, he entered a plea of 
Guilty.
[3]
 The 
accused confirmed before the court 
that the plea of guilty was entered freely and voluntarily and that he 
was aware 
of the consequences of his plea.


The accused admitted before the court that Emily is his 
daughter.
[4]
 When 
his wife, Emilyâs mother, died, he 
took care of their four (4) children.
[5]
 
He stated that he raped Emily because she looked so much like her 
mother.
[6]
He was 
deeply sorry for what he did and 
would like to ask forgiveness from his daughter.
[7]
 However, he denied that he used any 
bladed 
weapon during the incident.
[8]
 He 
likewise stated that Emily neither fought back nor resisted his 
advances.
[9]


When called to the witness stand, Emily Geron testified that 
she was born on 
May 12, 1981.
[10]
 
She recalled that 
sometime in the evening of July 1996, she was fast asleep when she felt 
somebody 
pulling her blanket. She was surprised to see her father lying beside 
her.
[11]
 The 
accused ordered her to face him and 
he started kissing her. She tried to resist his advances by pushing him 
but her 
father shouted and scolded her and because he was stronger, he was able 
to 
remove her clothes.
[12]
 He next lied on 
top of her and he succeeded in inserting his penis inside her 
vagina.
[13]
 She 
pleaded for her father to stop but to 
no avail.
[14]
 His 
father raped her on 
several other occasions until she got pregnant.
[15]


The victim remained silent about her ordeal until January 10, 
1997, when her 
grandmother, Amparo Torente, visited her. Amparo noticed that Emily was 
pregnant 
and she prevailed upon her granddaughter to reveal what happened to 
her.
[16]
 Upon 
learning that it was Emilyâs father 
who raped her, Amparo brought Emily to the Department of Social Welfare 
and 
Development (DSWD). At the DSWD, they were assisted in bringing the 
matter to 
the authorities and the accused was finally apprehended.
[17]
 Emily gave birth on 
March 16, 1997, but 
her daughter died three (3) days after birth.
[18]


Dr. Amparo Annabelle Soliman, who conducted a medical 
examination of the 
victim, confirmed before the court
[19]
 
the following findings:




GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:


Height: 140 Weight: 78 lbs.


Fairly nourished, conscious, coherent, cooperative, ambulatory 
subject.


Breasts engorged, with prominent veins, with colostrum. 
Areolae, dark brown, 
4.5 cms. in diameter. Nipples, dark brown, protruding, 1.2 cms. in 
diameter.


No extragenital physical injury noted.


GENITAL EXAMINATION:


Pubic hair, fully grown, scanty. Labia majora, coaptated. Labia
 minora, 
coaptated. Fourchette, lax. Vestibular mucosa, violaceous. Hymen, 
moderately 
thick, moderately wide, intact but distensible. Hymenal orifice admits a
 tube 
2.5 cms. in diameter. Vaginal walls, lax. Rugosities, shallow.


Bimanual examination reveals a soft, closed cervix attached to 
an enlarge 
mass which is the uterus, size of which is compatible to 4th months 
gestation. 
Fundie height is 12 cms.


CONCLUSIONS:


No evident sign of extragenital physical injury 
noted on the body of the 
subject at the time of examination. 





Probable signs of pregnancy present corresponding 
on or about the first week 
of the second trimester.
[20]
 


After trial, the court ruled, as follows: 



WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the accused ROMEO 
GERON is hereby 
sentenced to death by lethal injection.


The accused is also ordered to pay Emily Geron the amount of 
P50,000.00 as 
moral and P75,000.00 as actual or compensatory damages.


Further, he shall suffer all the accessory penalties attached 
to the penalty 
provided for by law.


Cost against the accused.


SO ORDERED.
[21]


In assailing the accusedâs conviction, the defense argued 
before this Court 
that:




THE COURT A QUO COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN CONVICTING THE 
ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE 
PROSECUTION 
FAILED TO ESTABLISH HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.


THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF 
THE CRIME 
CHARGED DESPITE HIS IMPROVIDENT PLEA OF NOT GUILTY.
[22]


After a careful review of the records of this case, the Court 
finds no reason 
to reverse the decision of the trial court.


It should be stressed that accused-appellant pleaded Guilty to 
the crime of 
rape. He declared before the trial court that his plea was made freely 
and 
voluntarily and that he was aware of the consequences thereof. He 
testified:




Atty. IbaÃ±ez


Q Earlier you were arraigned before this Court of an offense of
 rape against 
your own daughter, and you entered a plea of guilty?
A Yes, 
sir.


Q Did anybody forced, coerced or promise (sic) you something in
 order for you 
to enter a plea of guilty?
A No, sir, because I want to save 
the complainant 
from the trouble of coming to this Court.


Q Did this representation advised (sic) you to plead 
guilty?
A No, 
sir.


Q So, it was your free and voluntary decision to enter a plea 
of guilty?
A 
Yes, sir.


Q You are aware of the consequence of your pleading 
guilty?
A Yes, 
sir.


Q And that the Court may impose a penalty of death or life 
sentence?
A 
Yes, sir.
[23]


The defense would like to impress upon the Court that when 
accused-appellant 
entered a plea of guilty, he was not fully aware that he would be 
imposed the 
penalty of death. The defense cited accused-appellantâs testimony 
whereby he 
stated that he would ask the court to give him the penalty of life 
imprisonment.
[24]


The Court is not convinced. While accused-appellant stated that
 he would ask 
for the imposition of life imprisonment, there was nothing in the 
records that 
would show that he was solely motivated by his erroneous assumption that
 he 
would be spared the penalty of death.


In any event, even without the admission by accused-appellant, 
the 
prosecution was able to duly establish the rape committed against the 
victim. 
The candid and straightforward testimony of Emily certainly deserves 
credence. 
She testified:




Q While you were sleeping, do you know if there was an unusual 
incident that 
occurred?


A Yes, sir.


Q Will you tell us what happened while you were 
sleeping?
A I felt that 
someone was pulling my blanket.


Q And did you come to know who was the one pulling your blanket
 while you 
were sleeping?
A Yes, sir.


Q Who was the one pulling your blanket?
A My father, 
sir.


Q And what did your father do next after he pulled your blanket
 while you 
were sleeping?
A He laid beside me.


Q What was your position when your father pulled your 
blanket?
A He was 
laying by my side.


Q You said that your father laid beside you, what did you do 
when your father 
laid beside you?
A He made me face him.


Q And what happened next after your father made you face 
him?
A When I was 
already facing him, he kissed me.


Q And what did you do when he kissed you?
A I was 
removing his face from 
my face.


Q And what else did he do when you refused his 
kisses?
A He scolded 
me.


Q How did he scold you?
A He shouted at me and told me
 to agree with 
him.


Q And did you fight back?
A Yes, sir.


Q How did you fight your father?
A I pushed him away 
from me.


Q And did you succeed in pushing away your father?
A 
No, sir.


Q Why not?
A Because the place where we were laying 
down is too small.


Q And was your father strong?
A Yes, sir.


Q How did you fight back?
A When he was removing my 
clothes, I pushed so 
that my clothes will not be removed.


Q And were you able to prevent your father from removing your 
clothes?
A 
Yes, sir.


Q And then, what happened next?
A When he was finally 
able to remove my 
clothings, he raped me.


Q Now, you said that your father raped you, how did your father
 rape 
you?
A He inserted his penis on my vagina, sir.


Q When your father inserted his penis inside your vagina, did 
you fight 
back?
A Yes, sir.


Q Before he inserted his penis to your vagina, did you fight 
back?
A Yes, 
sir.


Q How did you fight your father?
A I pushed him, 
sir.


Q Did you succeed in fighting your father?
A No, 
sir.


Fiscal Ralar:


At this juncture, may we manifest that the witness is already 
crying and she 
could hardly speak.


Court:


Ask her if she could testify further.


Fiscal Ralar: (To the witness)


: Can you still continue with your testimony?


A Yes, sir.


Q Now, when your father inserted his penis into your vagina, 
how did you 
feel?
A It was painful, sir.


Q And did you fight back when you felt pain in your 
vagina?
A Yes, 
sir.


Q And then, what happened next after your father inserted his 
penis into your 
vagina?
A I was crying, sir.


Q And did your father stop from sexually assaulting you when 
you were 
crying?
A No, sir.


Q And what did he do while he was on top of you?
A He 
just continued on 
his desire even I told him to stop on what he was doing.


Q Did he stop when you told him to stop?
A No, 
sir.


Q And then, what happened next when he did not stop?
A
 He just continued 
to sexually molest me.


Q And then, what happened next?
A He would not like to
 stop, sir.


Q And then, did he finally stop from sexually assaulting 
you?
A When he 
was already through with his acts, sir.


Q Now, tell us how many times did your father sexually molest 
you?
A Many 
times, sir.


Q When was the first time when your father sexually abused 
you?
A That was 
on July, 1996.


Q And when was the second time when your father sexually abused
 you?
A 
After a week, sir,


Q How many times in a week do your father sexually molest you 
after July, 
1996?
A Sometimes twice a week, sir.


Q Up to when did the accused last sexually abuse 
you?
A I cannot remember 
anymore, sir.


Q Do you know when was your father finally arrested?
A
 Yes, sir.


Q Tell us when?
A That was January 11, 1997.


Q Could you approximate to us how many times your father 
sexually molest you 
from July 1996 up to the time he was finally arrested in January 11, 
1997?
A 
I cannot remember but that was many times, sir.


Q Now, you said that you were sexually molested many times by 
your father, do 
you recall if you got pregnant?
A Yes, sir.


Q And what happened to the child you were bearing?
A 
The child died.


Q Tell us when was the child delivered?
A On March 16,
 1997, sir.
[25]


Accused-appellant denied that he used any weapon to subdue the 
victim. He 
likewise stated before the trial court that Emily did not resist his 
advances. 
On this score, we find the testimony of Emily more believable. Further, 
it 
should be remembered that accused-appellant is the father of the victim.
 
Accused-appellantâs physical and moral ascendancy are enough to cower 
the victim 
into submission to his sexual desires.
[26]


Although it was established beyond reasonable doubt that Emily 
was raped by 
accused-appellant, the Court finds that the lower court erred in 
imposing the 
supreme penalty of death upon him. Republic Act No. 7659 (the Death 
Penalty 
Law), which was already in force at that time the rape was committed in 
July 
1996,
[27]
 requires
 that the circumstances 
of the minority of the victim and her relationship with the offender 
must concur 
for the death penalty to be imposable. Article 335 of the Revised Penal 
Code, as 
amended by R.A. No. 7659 provides:




x x x


The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is
 committed 
with any of the following attendant circumstances.


1. When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the 
offender is a 
parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or 
affinity 
within the third civil degree, or the common degree, or the common-law 
spouse of 
the parent of the victim.


x x x


The Court has previously explained that the circumstances of 
minority and 
relationship are considered as special qualifying circumstances because 
they 
alter the nature of the crime of rape and thus warrant the imposition of
 the 
death penalty. These two circumstances must be alleged in the 
information and 
established during trial for the court to be able to impose the death 
penalty.
[28]
 It 
was, therefore, incumbent 
upon the prosecution to satisfactorily prove both circumstances of 
minority and 
relationship.


In the case at bar, the prosecution did not present Emilyâs 
birth certificate 
to prove her minority at the time of the rape. Instead, it presented the
 birth 
certificate of Raquel Geron, the child born out of the incestuous rape, 
which 
certificate indicated that Emily was fifteen (15) years old at the time 
of her 
childâs birth.
[29]

 However, such proof is 
merely equivalent to a bare declaration on the part of Emily as to her 
age 
because it was she who furnished the data contained therein.
[30]
 Further, while 
accused-appellant also 
stated that Emily was fifteen (15) years old when the rape was committed
 in July 
1996,
[31]
 the 
Court notes that he merely 
replied âyesâ to the questions propounded to him on cross-examination, 
thus:




Court to Witness â


Q Do you also know that when you committed rape against your 
daughter, she 
was a minor?
A Yes, your Honor.


Q That she was only fifteen (15) years old?
A Yes, 
your Honor.
[32]


To our mind therefore, the foregoing do not prove Emilyâs 
minority beyond 
reasonable doubt.


In the absence of proof of Emilyâs minority, the penalty 
imposable for the 
offense is 
reclusion perpetua
. It is therefore 
necessary to reduce the 
civil indemnity awarded by the lower court from P75,000.00 to 
P50,000.00.


WHEREFORE,
 the decision of the 
trial court is hereby 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Romeo Geron is convicted 
of rape 
and sentenced to suffer the penalty of
 reclusion 
perpetua
 and is 
directed to indemnify Emily Geron the amount of P50,000.00 as civil 
indemnity 
and P50,000.00 as moral damages.
