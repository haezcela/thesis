VELASCO JR., J.:


The Case
Before the Court is a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court from the Resolutions dated July 10, 2017
[1]
 and October 19, 2017
[2]
 of the Sandiganbayan, Third Division in Criminal Case Nos. SB-17-CRM-0642 to 0643 and Criminal Case Nos. SB-17-CRM-0644 to 0645. The first assailed resolution denied petitioner's motion for reinvestigation, among others, while the second assailed motion denied petitioner's motion for partial reconsideration of the first assailed resolution.
The Facts
The case arose from the complaint dated May 11, 2015 filed by the Field Investigation Office I (FIO I) of the Office of the Ombudsman against petitioner Johanne Edward B. Labay (Petitioner Labay) for his participation in the alleged anomalous utilization of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) of former Representative of the 1
st
 District of Davao del Sur, Marc Douglas C. Cagas IV (Rep. Cagas IV). The complaint was for violation of Article 217 (Malversation of Public Funds or Property), Article 171 (Falsification of Public Documents), paragraphs (1), (2), (4), and (7), Article 217 in relation to Article 171 (Malversation thru Falsification of Public Documents), all of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as well as Section 3, paragraphs (a) and (e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, as amended. The case was docketed as OMB-C-C-15-0152.
[3]
The complaint alleged that Rep. Cagas IV, in conspiracy with other public officials and private individuals such as petitioner Labay, through the Technology Resource Center (TRC), sought the release and transfer of his PDAF in the total amount of Php6,000,000.00 to Farmer-business Development Corporation (FDC), which was led by its then president, herein petitioner Labay. However, upon field verification conducted by the FIO I, it appears that the livelihood projects funded by Rep. Cagas IV's PDAF were never implemented and were considered to be "ghost projects."
[4]
In a Joint Order dated September 1, 2015, the Ombudsman directed respondents to file their respective counter-affidavits.
[5]
 Several respondents filed their respective counter-affidavits. However, copies of this Order could not be served on petitioner Labay.
[6]
According to the Ombudsman, it exerted diligent efforts to serve copies of the September 1, 2015 Joint Order on petitioner Labay through his office and at his last known address. However, the copies were returned unserved because he was no longer employed in that office and he was unknown at the given residential address. As such, the Ombudsman proceeded with the preliminary investigation without any counter-affidavit or participation from petitioner Labay.
[7]
In a Resolution dated May 10, 2016,
[8]
 the Ombudsman found probable cause to indict Rep. Cagas IV and his co-respondents, including petitioner Labay, for conspiracy in the commission of two counts of Violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, one count of Malversation of Public Funds, and one count of Malversation thru Falsification.
Petitioner alleges that it was unknown to him that preliminary investigations for the charges against him were being conducted by the Ombudsman. According to him, it was only sometime in October 2016 that he learned of the cases when his daughter, Atty. Jo Blanca P.B. Labay, came across the press releases of the Ombudsman wherein petitioner was mentioned as among those who are facing charges.
[9]
On October 3, 2016, Atty. Labay, on behalf of her father, attempted to secure information on the cases from the Central Records of the Ombudsman, but she was advised to submit a written request. Accordingly, Atty. Labay sent the Ombudsman a letter dated October 4, 2016 in compliance with the said directive.
[10]
In a letter dated October 10, 2016, the Ombudsman replied to Atty. Labay's request and served on her copies of its May 10, 2016 Resolution. At the same time, the Ombudsman directed Atty. Labay to file a motion for reconsideration of the said Resolution within five days from receipt thereof.
[11]
Accordingly, petitioner, through Atty. Labay, filed an 
Omnibus Motion for Reinvestigation and Deferment of Filing of Information with Request for Copies of Complaint-Affidavit and Supporting Documents
 dated November 16, 2016.
[12]
 In said Omnibus Motion, petitioner prayed that the Ombudsman conduct a reinvestigation on his alleged participation in the crimes charged and take into consideration his answer and counter-evidence which he would present. He pointed out that he had neither been notified that a complaint had been filed against him nor was furnished a copy of the same. Thus, he argued that he was not afforded an opportunity to present his defense and to participate during the preliminary investigation. More importantly, petitioner prayed that he be furnished copies of the complaintÂ­-affidavit and other supporting documents and that he be given time to gather his evidence and submit his answer to the complaint. At the same time, he prayed for the deferment of the filing of any charges against him arising out of the May 10, 2016 Resolution pending the reinvestigation of the case.
[13]
In its Order dated November 25, 2016,
[14]
 the Ombudsman denied petitioner Labay's Omnibus Motion, ruling thus:
This Office had exerted diligent efforts to serve on Labay copies of the 1 September 2015 Order directing him to submit his counter-affidavit and the 10 May 2016 Resolution finding him probably guilty of the charges. The same were sent to his office and at his last known address and were returned unserved because he was no longer employed in that office, or was unknown at the given address. There was sufficient compliance with due process.
The filing by Labay of the 
Omnibus Motion for Reinvestigation
 on 16 November 2016 cured whatever defect in the observance of due process. 
Denial of due process cannot he success. fully invoked by a party who has had the opportunity to be heard on his motion for reconsideration.
WHEREFORE
, this Office, through the undersigned, 
DENIES
 respondents Marc Douglas C. Cagas IV's 
Motion for Reconsideration
 dated 10 August 2016
; Maria Rosalinda M. Lacsamana's 
Motion for Reconsideration
 dated 08 August 2016
; Consuela Lilian R. Espiritu's 
Motion for Reconsideration dated 10 August
 2016; Marivic V. Jover's 
Motion for Reconsideration
 dated 13 September 2016
; and Johanne Edward B. Labay's 
Motion for Reinvestigation and Deferment of Filing of Information with Request for Copies of Complaint-Affidavits and Supporting Documents
 dated 16 November 2016
.
All indictments against them, as originally embodied in the Resolution dated 10 May 2016, 
STAND
.
SO ORDERED.
[15]
 (Emphasis in the original)
Dissatisfied with this ruling, petitioner Labay filed an 
Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration (of the Order dated 25 November 2016) and Deferment of Filing of Information with Reiterative Request for Copies of Complaint-Affidavit and Supporting Documents
 dated January 30, 2017.
[16]
 Petitioner essentially reiterated his arguments in his first omnibus motion, but added that the filing of the said omnibus motion did not cure the defects in the Ombudsman's failure to observe due process.
[17]
The Ombudsman treated this second Omnibus Motion as a second motion for reconsideration and denied the same for lack of merit in its Order dated February 1, 2017.
[18]
On March 24, 2017, the Ombudsman filed four (4) Informations before the Sandiganbayan against petitioner Labay and his co-accused.
[19]
It was only on March 28, 2017, four days after the Informations had already been filed with the Sandiganbayan, that petitioner Labay was furnished a copy of the Complaint-Affidavit and its supporting evidence.
[20]
On April 4, 2017, petitioner Labay received copies of the Informations filed by the Ombudsman with the Sandiganbayan. Immediately thereafter, on April 5, 2017, petitioner Labay filed an Extremely Urgent Motion of even date, arguing that he is entitled to a reinvestigation of the case to prevent injustice against him brought about by the wrongful filing of charges without affording him his right to a complete preliminary investigation.
[21]
Ruling of the Sandiganbayan
In the assailed Resolution dated July 10, 2017, the Sandiganbayan denied petitioner's motion, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE
, the Court - 
 
(1) 
DECLARES
 the existence of probable cause in these cases. Accordingly, let warrants of arrest be issued against all the accused except for accused Marc Douglas Chan Cagas IV who had already posted bail;
(2)
NOTES
 the 
Urgent Motion for Judicial Determination of Probable Cause With Entry of Appearance
 dated April 4, 2017, filed by accused Marc Douglas Chan Cagas IV; and the 
Motion To Set Aside No Bail Recommendation in Crim Case No. SB-17-CRM-0644 for Malversation Through Falsification and To Fix the Amount of Bail in Crim Case No. SB-17-CRM-0644 for Malversation Through Falsification
 filed by accused Johanne Edward B. Labay; and
(3) 
DENIES
 the 
Motion For Reinvestigation and To Defer the Issuance of Warrants of Arrest
 filed by accused Johanne Edward B. Labay for lack of merit.
SO ORDERED.
[22]
Aggrieved, petitioner filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration
[23]
 dated August 3, 2017. However, this was denied for lack of merit and for being 
pro forma
 in the second assailed Resolution dated October 19, 2017.
[24]
Hence, this Petition for 
Certiorari
.
The Petition
In the present petition, petitioner prays for the (1) issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of injunction; (2) nullification and setting aside of the assailed Resolutions; (3) remand of the case to the Office of the Ombudsman for a reinvestigation of petitioner; and (4) suspension of the criminal proceedings with respect to petitioner Labay, pending the resolution of the reinvestigation before the Office of the Ombudsman.
Petitioner argues that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it denied him the constitutional right to due process by denying his prayer for a reinvestigation. Essentially, petitioner argues that he was not accorded a reasonable opportunity to be heard since he could not have effectively and intelligently moved for the reconsideration of the Ombudsman's May 10, 2016 Resolution due to the latter's failure to furnish him with a copy of the complaint affidavit and its attachments upon which the resolution was based.
In a Resolution
[25]
 dated March 21, 2018, this Court required respondent to file its Comment on the Petition and at the same time issued a temporary restraining order enjoining respondent Sandiganbayan to suspend the criminal proceedings against petitioner Labay.
On April 2, 2018, the People of the Philippines represented by the Office of the Ombudsman, through its counsel, the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), filed an 
Entry of Appearance with Comment and Motion to Dissolve the Temporary Restraining Order Issued on 21 March 2018
.
[26]
 It claimed that the Sandiganbayan did not act with grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner Labay's Motion for Partial Reconsideration. It argued that there was no violation of his constitutional right to due process
considering that he was given the opportunity to present countervailing evidence through the Ombudsman's effort to issue subpoenas at his last known addresses, especially since the government substantially complied with the requirements of the law in doing so.
[27]
Aside from the effort exerted in issuing subpoenas, the OSP contended that petitioner Labay was eventually informed of the nature of the accusations against him when he was furnished a copy of the Ombudsman's May 10, 2016 Resolution, in response to which he was able to file an omnibus motion. It further maintains that petitioner Labay had the opportunity to refute the charges against him and present any countervailing evidence he may have, but faults him for hiding on technicalities and insisting that he was denied due process without presenting any evidence to support his claim of having a valid and meritorious defense. In other words, the OSP asserted that petitioner Labay was afforded due process when he filed two motions seeking reinvestigation and reconsideration of the Ombudsman's rulings.
[28]
From the arguments presented by the parties, the Court is now faced with the issue of whether the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying petitioner Labay's motion for reinvestigation and ruling that he was not deprived of due process.
The Court's Ruling
The petition is meritorious.
After a judicious review of the records of the case, the Court finds that petitioner's constitutional right to due process was violated when he was not furnished a copy of the complaint affidavit and its attachments during the preliminary investigation.
Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution guarantees the right of every person to due process before they are deprived of their life, liberty, or property. Due process in criminal prosecutions is further emphasized under Section 14, Article III which provides that no person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of law. The same provision also states that the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved and shall enjoy the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.
Criminal due process requires that the procedure established by law or the rules be followed to assure that the State makes no mistake in taking the life or liberty except that of the guilty. All the necessary measures must be taken to guarantee procedural due process throughout all stages of a criminal prosecution-from the inception of custodial investigation until rendition of judgment.
[29]
A preliminary investigation is defined as an inquiry or proceeding for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof, and should be held for trial.
[30]
The right to have a preliminary investigation conducted before being bound over to trial for a criminal offense and be formally at risk of incarceration or some other penalty is not a mere formal or technical right. It is a substantive right since the accused in a criminal trial is inevitably exposed to prolonged anxiety, aggravation, humiliation, not to speak of expense, and the right to an opportunity to avoid a painful process is a valuable right.
[31]
 It is meant to secure the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive prosecution and to protect him from an open and public accusation of a crime, from the trouble, expenses and anxiety of a public trial. It is also intended to protect the state from having to conduct useless and expensive trials. Indeed, to deny a person's claim to a preliminary investigation would be to deprive him the full measure of his right to due process.
[32]
Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 07 otherwise known as the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman (Ombudsman Rules of Procedure) lays down the procedure to be followed in handling preliminary investigations of criminal complaints brought before the Ombudsman for offenses in violation of R.A. 3019, as amended, R.A. 1379 as amended, R.A. 6713, Title VII, Chapter II, Section 2 of the Revised Penal Code, and for such other offenses committed by public officers and employees in relation to their office.
[33]
 It provides:
Section 3. Preliminary investigation; who may conduct. Preliminary Investigation may be conducted by any of the following:
1) Ombudsman Investigators;
2) Special Prosecuting Officers;
3) Deputized Prosecutors;
4) Investigating Officials authorized by law to conduct preliminary investigations or
5) Lawyers in the government service, so designated by the Ombudsman.
Section 4. Procedure - The preliminary investigation of cases falling under the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan and Regional Trial Courts shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in Section 3, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, subject to the following provisions:
a) If the complaint is not under oath or is based only on official reports, the investigating officer shall require the complainant or supporting witnesses to execute affidavits to substantiate the complaints.
b) After such affidavits have been secured, the investigating officer shall issue an order, attaching thereto a copy of the affidavits and other supporting documents, directing the respondents to submit, within ten (10) days from receipt thereof, his counter-affidavits and controverting evidence with proof of service thereof on the complainant. The complainant may file reply affidavits within ten (10) days after service of the counter-affidavits.
c) If the respondent does not file a counter-affidavit, the investigating officer may consider the comment filed by him, if any, as his answer to the complaint. In any event, the respondent shall have access to the evidence on record.
d) No motion to dismiss shall be allowed except for lack of jurisdiction. Neither may a motion for a bill of particulars be entertained. If respondents desire any matter in the complainant's affidavit to be clarified, the particularization thereof may be done at the time of clarificatory questioning in the manner provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
e) If the respondents cannot be served with the order mentioned in paragraph 6 hereof, or having been served, does not comply therewith, the complaint shall be deemed submitted for resolution on the basis of the evidence on the record.
f) If, after the filing of the requisite affidavits and their supporting evidences, there are facts material to the case which the investigating officer may need to be clarified on, he may conduct a clarificatory hearing during which the parties shall be afforded the opportunity to be present but without the right to examine or cross-examine the witness being questioned. Where the appearance of the parties or witnesses is impracticable, the clarificatory questioning may be conducted in writing, whereby the questions desired to be asked by the investigating officer or a party shall be reduced into writing and served on the witness concerned who shall be required to answer the same in writing and under oath.
g) Upon the termination of the preliminary investigation, the investigating officer shall forward the records of the case together with his resolution to the designated authorities for their appropriate action thereon.
No information may be filed and no complaint may be dismissed without the written authority or approval of the Ombudsman in cases falling within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, or of the proper Deputy Ombudsman in all other cases.
Section 3, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure also provides similar guidelines in the conduct of preliminary investigation, to wit:
Section 3.
 
Procedure
. - The preliminary investigation shall be conducted in the following manner:
(a) The complaint shall state the address of the respondent and shall be accompanied by the affidavits of the complainant and his witnesses, as well as other supporting documents to establish probable cause. They shall be in such number of copies as there are respondents, plus two (2) copies for the official file. The affidavits shall be subscribed and sworn to before any prosecutor or government official authorized to administer oath, or, in their absence or unavailability, before a notary public, each of who must certify that he personally examined the affiants and that he is satisfied that they voluntarily executed and understood their affidavits.
(b) Within ten (10) days after the filing of the complaint, the investigating officer shall either dismiss it if he finds no ground to continue with the investigation, or issue a subpoena to the respondent attaching to it a copy of the complaint and its supporting affidavits and documents.
The respondent shall have the right to examine the evidence submitted by the complainant which he may not have been furnished and to copy them at his expense. If the evidence is voluminous, the complainant may be required to specify those which he intends to present against the respondent, and these shall be made available for examination or copying by the respondent at his expense.
Objects as evidence need not be furnished a party but shall be made available for examination, copying, or photographing at the expense of there questing party.
(c) Within ten (10) days from receipt of the subpoena with the complaint and supporting affidavits and documents, the respondent shall submit his counter-affidavit and that of his witnesses and other supporting documents relied upon for his defense. The counter-affidavits shall be subscribed and sworn to and certified as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, with copies thereof furnished by him to the complainant. The respondent shall not be allowed to file a motion to dismiss in lieu of a counter-affidavit.
(d) If the respondent cannot be subpoenaed, or if subpoenaed, does not submit counter-affidavits within the ten (10) day period, the investigating officer shall resolve the complaint based on the evidence presented by the complainant.
(e) The investigating officer may set a hearing if there are facts and issues to be clarified from a party or a witness. The parties can be present at the hearing but without th. right to examine or cross-examine. They may, however, submit to the investigating officer questions which may be asked to the party or witness concerned.
The hearing shall be held within ten (10) days from submission of the counter-affidavits and other documents or from the expiration of the period for their submission. It shall be terminated within five (5) days.
(f) Within ten (10) days after the investigation, the investigating officer shall determine whether or not there is sufficient ground to hold the respondent for trial. (3a)
It is clear from the foregoing that an accused in a criminal case has the right to be informed of the charges against him,
[34]
 to submit a counterÂ­ affidavit, and to have access to and examine all other evidence submitted by the complainant.
[35]
In the case before Us, a complaint was filed by the FIO I of the Office of the Ombudsman against petitioner Labay for representing the Farmerbusjness Development Corporation (FDC) in the alleged anomalous utilization of the PDAF of Rep. Cagas IV.
[36]
 The Ombudsman directed those charged to file their respective counter-affidavits,
[37]
 but copies of this Order could not be served on petitioner Labay.
[38]
 It appears that the Ombudsman attempted to serve copies of the September 1, 2015 Joint Order on petitioner Labay at his office at the National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC) and at his last known residence. However, the copies were returned unserved because he was no longer employed in that office and he was unknown at the given residential address. As such, the Ombudsman proceeded with the preliminary investigation without any counter-affidavit or participation from petitioner Labay.
[39]
Thereafter, the Ombudsman found probable cause to indict petitioner and his co-respondents for conspiracy in the commission of two counts of Violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, one count of Malversation of Public Funds, and one count of Malversation thru Falsification.
Upon learning from press releases of the Ombudsman about the criminal charges against him,
[40]
 petitioner Labay, through his daughter, Atty. Labay, attempted to secure information on the cases from the Central Records of the Ombudsman. Upon being advised to submit a written request, Atty. Labay sent the Ombudsman a letter dated October 4, 2016 in compliance with the said directive.
[41]
 In response to Atty. Labay's letter request, the Ombudsman replied to Atty. Labay's request through a letter dated October 10, 2016 and served on her copies of its May 10, 2016 Resolution. In the letter, the Ombudsman directed Atty. Labay to file a motion for reconsideration of the said Resolution within five days from receipt thereof.
[42]
Petitioner filed an 
Omnibus Motion for Reinvestigation and Deferment of Filing of Information with Request for Copies of Complaint-Affidavit and Supporting Documents
 dated November 16, 2016,
[43]
 praying, among others, that a reinvestigation be conducted on his behalf, asserting that he was not afforded an opportunity to present his defense and to participate during the preliminary investigation since he had neither been notified that a complaint had been filed against him nor was furnished a copy of the same. Petitioner also prayed that he be furnished copies of the complaint-affidavit and other supporting documents and that he be given time to gather his evidence and submit his answer to the complaint.
[44]
 However, the Ombudsman denied petitioner Labay's Omnibus Motion, ruling that his right to due process had not been violated since he had the opportunity to be heard when he filed the Omnibus Motion.
[45]
Aggrieved, petitioner Labay filed another Omnibus Motion essentially reiterating his arguments in his first omnibus motion, but additionally argued that the filing of the first omnibus motion did not cure the defects in the Ombudsman's failure to observe due process when it failed to serve on him copies of the complaint affidavit.
[46]
 The Ombudsman treated this second Omnibus Motion as a second motion for reconsideration and denied the same for lack of merit in its Order dated February 1, 2017.
[47]
Thereafter, on March 24, 2017, the Ombudsman filed four (4) Informations before the Sandiganbayan against petitioner Labay and his coÂ­-accused.
[48]
 It was only on March 28, 2017 that petitioner Labay was furnished a copy of the Complaint-Affidavit and its supporting evidence.
[49]
Upon receiving copies of the Informations filed by the Ombudsman, petitioner Labay immediately filed an Extremely Urgent Motion with the Sandiganbayan arguing that he is entitled to a reinvestigation of the case to prevent injustice against him brought about by the wrongful filing of charges without affording him his right to a complete preliminary investigation.
[50]
The Sandiganbayan, however, sustained the Ombudsman's position in the assailed Resolution dated July 10, 2017, ruling that petitioner's right to due process was not violated since he was afforded reasonable opportunity to address the charges against him when he filed two motions with the Ombudsman. The Sandiganbayan ruled, thus:
The Court finds accused Labay's motion for reinvestigation bereft of merit.
The essence of due process is that a party is afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard in support of his case. What the law abhors and prohibits is the absolute absence of the opportunity to be heard. When the party seeking due process was in fact given several opportunities to be heard and to air his side, but it was by his own fault or choice that he squandered these chances, then his cry for due process must fail.
 Admittedly, there is no showing that accused Labay was served a copy of the order requiring him to file his counter-affidavit. The record shows, however, that on October 4, 2016, accused Labay wrote the Office of the Ombudsman requesting information on case numbers and titles of the cases it referred to in its press release where his name appears. In reply to the said letter, the Office of the Ombudsman confirmed that accused Labay is a respondent in two (2) cases and furnished him copies of the Resolutions dated May 10, 2016 and June 3, 2016. It also reminded accused Labay that he has five (5) days from notice within which to file a motion for reconsideration.
Thus, on November 16, 2016, accused Labay filed a Motion for Reinvestigation and Deferment of Filing of Information with Request for Copies of Complaint-Affidavits and Supporting Documents assailing the Office of the Ombudsman's Resolution dated May 10, 2016, finding probably cause to indict him. The said motion was denied by the Office of the Ombudsman in its Order dated November 25, 2016 upon the following ratiocination:
x x x x
Thereafter, accused Labay filed an Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration and Deferment of Filing of Information assailing the above order. In denying the said motion, the Office of the Ombudsman pointed out that while accused Labay asserted that he did not commit the crimes imputed to him and that he did not participate in any conspiracy in the commission of the crimes, he prayed that the Office of the Ombudsman conduct a reinvestigation, furnish him a copy of the complaint, allow him to gather evidence and submit counter-affidavit. Further, the Office of the Ombudsman held that when accused Labay filed his second motion, he already exhausted his remedy under Section 7(a), Rule II of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman which allows the filing of only one (1) motion for reconsideration or reinvestigation.
The above circumstances unerringly show that accused Labay was accorded due process by filing two (2) motions before the Office of the Ombudsman.
We disagree.
There is no dispute that the Ombudsman was unable to serve copies of the complaint or of its September 1, 2015 Joint Order on petitioner Labay prior to or even during the preliminary investigation of the case. This was never denied by the OSP in its Comment, stating thus:
20. By 
Joint Order
 dated 01 September 2015, the Office of the Ombudsman directed therein respondents (including Labay) to file their respective counter-affidavits.
21. Despite earnest efforts, copies of the 
Joint Order
 could not be served in the last known or given addresses of Cunanan, Semillano, Carrasco, Reyes, and 
herein petitioner Labay
, after they have been noted to be unknown in said addresses, or had moved out and left no forwarding address.
[51]
 (emphasis in the original)
As pointed out by petitioner, the Ombudsman only tried to effect service of the order to file his counter affidavit on petitioner on one instance, albeit to two different addresses. However, this service failed since petitioner was no longer employed at his former office at NAPC, as confirmed by the letter sent by the NAPC Secretary and Lead Convenor, and since he was no longer residing at the residential address where the order was sent.
In its Comment, the OSP seeks refuge in paragraph (e), Section 4 of the Ombudsman Rules of Procedure which provides that in cases where the respondents cannot be served with the order to file their counter-affidavit, or having been served but does not comply therewith, the complaint shall be deemed submitted for resolution on the basis of the evidence on the record.
While the Ombudsman was correct in resolving the complaint based on the evidence presented in accordance with Paragraph (e), Section 4 of the Ombudsman Rules of Procedure, the situation, however, effectively changed when petitioner made himself available to the Ombudsman when he requested access to the case records. The Ombudsman had a clear opportunity to furnish petitioner with copies of the complaint affidavit and its supporting documents. Instead, it merely decided to furnish petitioner with a copy of its May 10, 2016 Resolution.
Even assuming that the Ombudsman was merely complying with Atty. Labay's request for information when it responded with the case titles and docket numbers of the cases pending against petitioner Labay, it should have exercised its duty to inform petitioner of the charges filed against him by furnishing him copies of the complaint affidavit and its supporting documents. Or at the very least, it should have directed and allowed petitioner to access these records at its office. This, however, was not done by the Ombudsman.
We also cannot subscribe to the Sandiganbayan's justification that petitioner was afforded reasonable opportunity to address the charges against him since he was able to file a motion for reinvestigation with the Ombudsman. By the mere fact that petitioner was not yet even furnished a copy of the complaint affidavit at the time he received the Ombudsman's May 10, 2016 Resolution, it is clear that he could not effectively and sufficiently address the allegations against him. Petitioner Labay should not be blamed for being unable to raise any substantive defense in either the omnibus motions he filed with the Ombudsman since he had not even seen any of the allegations filed against by the FIO. More importantly, he could not have been expected to seek appropriate evidence to support his defense when he was not even given any access to the documents submitted by the FIO in support of its complaint.
In fact, the violation of petitioner's constitutional right to due process is made even more evident when the Ombudsman unceremoniously denied his request to be furnished copies of the complaint affidavit and its supporting documents in the first omnibus motion that he filed, and reiterated in his second omnibus motion. In both orders denying the two omnibus motions, the Ombudsman seemingly ignored petitioner's requests and effectively denied petitioner of his right to secure copies of the complaint affidavit. This should not be tolerated.
Unfortunately, the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion when it failed to grant petitioner Labay's 
Extremely Urgent Omnibus Motion
 despite the glaring violations committed by the Ombudsman. The Sandiganbayan should have recognized these patent violations and ordered the remand of the case to the Ombudsman for the conduct of a proper preliminary investigation with respect to petitioner Labay's participation in the crimes charged. Instead, it chose to turn a blind eye towards the injustice committed against petitioner.
Time and again, the Court has held that suppression of evidence, regardless of its nature, is enough to violate the due process rights of the accused.
[52]
 In the present case, it was not only the prosecution's evidence which was withheld from petitioner. In denying petitioner Labay's multiple requests for copies of the complaint affidavit, the Ombudsman deprived him of his right to sufficiently and reasonably know the charges and accusations against him. This is a patent violation of his constitutional right to due process.
In 
Duterte v. Sandiganbayan
,
[53]
 this Court ordered the dismissal of the criminal case against the accused when they were not sufficiently apprised of the charges against them during preliminary investigation, thus:
We have judiciously studied the case records and we find that the preliminary investigation of the charges against petitioners has been conducted not in the manner laid down in Administrative Order No. 07.
In the 12 November 1991 Order of Graft Investigator Manriquez, petitioners were merely directed to submit a point-by-point comment under oath on the allegations in Civil Case No. 20,550-91 and SAR No. 91-05. The said order was not accompanied by a single affidavit of any person charging petitioners of any offense as required by law. They were just required to comment upon the allegations in Civil Case No. 20,550-91 of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City which had earlier been dismissed and on the COA Special Audit Report. Petitioners had no inkling that they were being subjected to a preliminary investigation as in fact there was no indication in the order that a preliminary investigation was being conducted. If Graft Investigator Manriquez had intended merely to adopt the allegations of the plaintiffs in the civil case or the Special Audit Report (whose recommendation for the cancellation of the contract in question had been complied with) as his basis for criminal prosecution, then the procedure was plainly anomalous and highly irregular. As a consequence, petitioners constitutional right to due process was violated. (citations omitted)
While the 
Duterte
 case is not on all fours with the case before Us, We find that the Ombudsman's failure to furnish petitioner Labay with copies of the complaint affidavit and its supporting documents despite the latter's numerous attempts and requests to secure the same is more severe as it gravely endangers petitioner's right to liberty through no fault of his own. Undeniably, petitioner Labay's receipt of the May 10, 2016 Resolution is not equivalent to receipt of the complaint affidavit and its supporting documents.
The OSP's assertion in its comment that petitioner deliberately evaded the Ombudsman's attempts to serve its orders on him is purely hypothetical and is not supported by any concrete proof. There is also no merit in the OSP's position that it was incumbent on petitioner Labay to justify his whereabouts during the time that the Ombudsman was attempting service of the subpoena on him since no law or regulation requires an accused in a preliminary investigation to submit himself to the Ombudsman or at the very least update the latter of his latest address. The burden should not be placed on the accused since it is the State which has the responsibility to use its resources for the proper implementation of the law. To rule otherwise would effectively curtail the constitutionally protected rights of the people to be secure with their life, liberty and property.

DISSENTING OPINION
LEONEN, J.:
I dissent. This case should have been elevated to the Court 
En Banc
 as it is contrary to the doctrine established in 
De Lima v. Reyes
,
[1]
 
Pemberton v. De Lima
,
[2]
 
Napoles v. De Lima
,
[3]
 and 
Cambe v. Office of the Ombudsman
.
[4]
Petitioner was not deprived of due process in the preliminary investigation before the Office of the Ombudsman. Not having been deprived of due process, there is no reason for the Office of the Ombudsman to conduct a reinvestigation of the complaint against him. In any case, the filing of the Information with the Sandiganbayan already vests the Sandiganbayan with jurisdiction to determine the existence of probable cause. The issuance of a warrant of arrest already renders moot any irregularities that may have occurred during the preliminary investigation.
I
This Court should not confuse the constitutional rights accorded to an accused in a criminal prosecution and the rights accorded to a respondent in a preliminary investigation. Due process in a preliminary investigation is not a constitutional right but merely a statutory privilege. In 
Lozada v. Hernandez
:
[5]
It has been said time and again that a preliminary investigation is not properly a trial or any part thereof but is merely preparatory thereto, its only purpose being to determine whether a crime has been committed and whether there is probable cause to believe the accused guilty thereof. The right to such investigation is not a fundamental right guaranteed by the constitution. At most, it is statutory. And rights conferred upon accused persons to participate in preliminary investigations concerning themselves depend upon the provisions of law by which such rights are specifically secured, rather than upon the phrase "due process of law."
[6]
The rules governing the procedure for the conduct of a preliminary investigation are those outlined in Rule 112, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, which are reproduced in the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman:
[7]
RULE 112
Preliminary Investigation
....
Section 3. Procedure. - The preliminary investigation shall be conducted in the following manner:
(a) The complaint shall state the address of the respondent and shall be accompanied by the affidavits of the complainant and his witnesses, as well as other supporting documents to establish probable cause. They shall be in such number of copies as there are respondents, plus two (2) copies for the official file. The affidavits shall be subscribed and sworn to before any prosecutor or government official authorized to administer oath, or in their absence or unavailability, before a notary public, each of whom must certify that he personally examined the affiants and that he is satisfied that they voluntarily executed and understood their affidavits.
(b) Within ten (10) days after the filing of the complaint, the investigating officer shall either dismiss it if he finds no ground to continue with the investigation, or issue a subpoena to the respondent attaching to it a copy of the complaint and its supporting affidavits and documents.
The respondent shall have the right to examine the evidence submitted by the complainant which he may not have been furnished and to copy them at his expense. If the evidence is voluminous, the complainant may be required to specify those which he intends to present against the respondent, and these shall be made available for examination or copying by the respondent at his expense.
Objects as evidence need not be furnished a party but shall be made available for examination, copying, or photographing at the expense of the requesting party.
(c) Within ten (10) days from receipt of the subpoena with the complaint and supporting affidavits and documents, the respondent shall submit his counter-affidavit and that of his witnesses and other supporting documents relied upon for his defense. The counter-affidavits shall be subscribed and sworn to and certified as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, with copies thereof furnished by him to the complainant. The respondent shall not be allowed to file a motion to dismiss in lieu of a counter-affidavit.
(d) If the respondent cannot be subpoenaed, or if subpoenaed, does not submit counter-affidavits within the ten (10) day period, the investigating officer shall resolve the complaint based on the evidence presented by the complainant.
(e) The investigating officer may set a hearing if there are facts and issues to be clarified from a party or a witness. The parties can be present at the hearing but without the right to examine or cross-examine. They may, however, submit to the investigating officer questions which may be asked to the party or witness concerned.
The hearing shall be held within ten (10) days from submission of the counter-affidavits and other documents or from the expiration of the period for their submission. It shall be terminated within five (5) days.
(f) Within ten (10) days after the investigation, the investigating officer shall determine whether or not there is sufficient ground to hold the respondent for trial.
The Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure state that the investigating prosecutor, in proceeding with the investigation, shall "issue a subpoena to the respondent attaching to it a copy of the complaint and its supporting affidavits and documents."
[8]
 This is mandatory. However, the Rules of Procedure do not state that the subpoena must be sent to respondent repeatedly until respondent submits a counter-affidavit. They only mandate that the investigating prosecutor must issue a subpoena to the respondent to file his or her counter-affidavit. Thus, Rule 112, Section 3(d) of the Rules of Court provides:
(d) If the respondent cannot be subpoenaed, or if subpoenaed, does not submit counter-affidavits within the ten (10) day period, 
the investigating officer shall resolve the complaint based on the evidence presented by the complainant
. (Emphasis supplied)
In this case, petitioner was sent copies of the Joint Order dated September 1, 2015, where the Ombudsman directed respondents to file their respective counter-affidavits, at two (2) of his addresses on record.
[9]
 The Ombudsman has already complied with what was required by the Rules of Court.
This case cannot be similar to that in 
Duterte v. Sandiganbayan
.
[10]
 In 
Duterte
, petitioners were merely ordered to comment on the complaints against them. They were not specifically ordered to file their respective counter-affidavits. Thus, they had reasonable ground to believe that a preliminary investigation had been conducted against them:
In the 12 November 1991 Order of Graft Investigator Manriquez, petitioners were merely directed to submit a point-by-point comment under oath on the allegations in Civil Case No. 20,550-91 and on SAR No. 91-05. The said order was not accompanied by a single affidavit of any person charging petitioners of any offense as required by law. They were just required to comment upon the allegations in Civil Case No. 20,550-91 of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City which had earlier been dismissed and on the COA Special Audit Report. Petitioners had no inkling that they were being subjected to a preliminary investigation as in fact there was no indication in the order that a preliminary investigation was being conducted. If Graft Investigator Manriquez had intended merely to adopt the allegations of the plaintiffs in the civil case or the Special Audit Report (whose recommendation for the cancellation of the contract in question had been complied with) as his bases for criminal prosecution, then the procedure was plainly anomalous and highly irregular. As a consequence, petitioners' constitutional right to due process was violated.
[11]
 (Citation omitted)
What this Court emphasized in 
Duterte
 was the egregious failure of the Office of the Ombudsman to follow its own rules of procedure. In this instance, Administrative Order No. 7 mandates the Office of the Ombudsman to issue a subpoena for respondents to file their respective counter-affidavits. The Ombudsman, in this case, has already complied with this mandate.
It must likewise be emphasized that while the Ombudsman found probable cause to charge petitioner even before he was aware of the investigation against him, 
this finding of probable cause was not yet final
. There was no information yet against petitioner filed with any court.
According to the facts in the 
ponencia
, the Ombudsman issued a Resolution dated May 10, 2016 finding probable cause to charge petitioner with conspiracy in the commission of two (2) counts of Violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, one (1) count of Malversation of Public Funds and one (1) count of Malversation thru Falsification.
[12]
 Petitioner alleged that he was made aware of this only in October 2016. Upon a letter request to the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman, on October 10. 2016, furnished petitioner with a copy of the May 10, 2016 Resolution.
[13]
However, instead of merely furnishing petitioner with a copy of the Resolution finding probable cause, the Ombudsman allowed petitioner to file a motion for reconsideration of the Resolution within five (5) days from receipt. In other words, 
the Ombudsman gave petitioner the opportunity to overturn her finding of probable cause by giving him time to submit his counter-affidavit and any other controverting evidence he might have
.
Petitioner was in an even better position than his co-respondents to refute the charges against him since he would have already been made aware, through the May 10, 2016 Resolution, of the specific evidence the Ombudsman found to have been convincing enough to find probable cause. He would have known exactly what evidence he needed to submit to controvert the findings against him, instead of merely guessing what the Ombudsman might find convincing, as he would have done during the preliminary investigation. Instead of taking this opportunity, petitioner instead filed an Omnibus Motion for Reinvestigation and Deferment of Filing of Information with Request for Copies of Complaint-Affidavit and Supporting Documents.
[14]
 Thus, in denying this Motion, the Ombudsman stated:
The filing by Labay of the 
Omnibus Motion for Reinvestigation
 on 16 November 2016 cured whatever defect in the observance of due process. Denial of due process cannot be successfully invoked by a party who has had the opportunity to be heard on his motion for reconsideration.
[15]
This Court has stated that "the essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard, or an opportunity to explain one's side or an opportunity to seek for a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of."
[16]
 Petitioner was granted an opportunity to be heard. Thus, he was not denied the right to due process.
II
Even assuming that there were irregularities in the conduct of the preliminary investigation, any petition filed to question these irregularities would already be rendered moot once the court issues a warrant of arrest against the accused.
There are two (2) stages in the determination of probable cause. The first stage is the executive determination of probable cause, which is done by the prosecutor in a preliminary investigation. The second stage is the judicial determination of probable cause. Once information has been submitted to the court, the court acquires full jurisdiction over the case.
[17]
 Therefore, any question must be addressed to its sound discretion. In 
Crespo v. Mogul
:
[18]
The rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.
[19]
The court's finding of probable cause is arrived at independent of the prosecutor's findings. Thus, any perceived irregularity in the conduct of the preliminary investigation does not affect the court's acquisition of jurisdiction. In 
People v. Narca
:
[20]
It must be emphasized that the preliminary investigation is not the venue for the full exercise of the rights of the parties. This is why preliminary investigation is not considered as a part of trial but merely preparatory thereto and that the records therein shall not form part of the records of the case in court. Parties may submit affidavits but have no right to examine witnesses though they can propound questions through the investigating office. In fact, a preliminary investigation may even be conducted exÂ­ parte in certain cases. Moreover, in Section 1 of Rule 112, the purpose of a preliminary investigation is only to determine a well grounded belief if a crime was "probably" committed by an accused. 
In any case, the invalidity or absence of a preliminary investigation does not affect the jurisdiction of the court which may have taken cognizance of the information nor impair the validity of the information or otherwise render it defective.
[21]
 (Emphasis supplied)
In this case, Informations were already filed against petitioner with the Sandiganbayan. In its July 10, 2017 Resolution, the Sandiganbayan found the existence of probable cause and issued a warrant of arrest against him.
[22]
 
The Sandiganbayan, independent of the findings of the Ombudsman in the preliminary investigation, found that based on the records, there was probable cause to arrest petitioner.
 Thus, any question on the conduct of the preliminary investigation was already rendered moot by the July 10, 2017 Resolution.
Thus, in 
De Lima v. Reyes
,
[23]
 this Court dismissed a Petition for Review on Certiorari questioning the Secretary of Justice's finding of probable cause against the accused for being moot:
Here, the trial court has already determined, independently of any finding or recommendation by the First Panel or the Second Panel, that probable cause exists for the issuance of the warrant of arrest against respondent. Probable cause has been judicially determined. Jurisdiction over the case, therefore, has transferred to the trial court. 
A petition for certiorari questioning the validity of the preliminary investigation in any other venue has been rendered moot by the issuance of the warrant of arrest and the conduct of arraignment.
The Court of Appeals should have dismissed the Petition for Certiorari filed before them when the trial court issued its warrant of arrest. Since the trial court has already acquired jurisdiction over the case and the existence of probable cause has been judicially determined, a petition for certiorari questioning the conduct of the preliminary investigation ceases to be the "plain, speedy, and adequate remedy" provided by law. Since this Petition for Review is an appeal from a moot Petition for Certiorari, it must also be rendered moot.
The prudent course of action at this stage would be to proceed to trial. Respondent, however, is not without remedies. He may still file any appropriate action before the trial court or question any alleged irregularity in the preliminary investigation during pre-trial.
[24]
 (Emphasis supplied)
The same ruling was applied in 
Pemberton v. De Lima
,
[25]
 
Napoles v. De Lima
,
[26]
 and 
Cambe v. Office of the Ombudsman
.
[27]
 There are no special circumstances in this case to re-visit this Court's ruling in these cases.
Even assuming further that the irregularities were enough to warrant a reinvestigation, it was within the Sandiganbayan's discretion to order its conduct. In 
Baltazar v. Ombudsman
,
[28]
 this Court emphasized that "courts are given wide latitude to accord the accused ample opportunity to present controverting evidence even before trial as demanded by due process."
[29]
Here, if indeed the Sandiganbayan found that petitioner was deprived of due process, it would have ordered a reinvestigation. However, the Sandiganbayan found that due process had already been accorded to petitioner but that petitioner squandered the opportunities given to submit his defense:
The essence of due process is that a party is afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard in support of his case. What the law abhors and prohibits is the absolute absence of the opportunity to be heard. When the party seeking due process was in fact given several opportunities to be heard and to air his side, but it was by his own fault or choice that he squandered these chances, then his cry for due process must fail.
[30]
The right to due process applies equally to the State and to the defense. In 
People v. Court of Appeals and Jonathan Cerbo
:
[31]
The rights of the people from what could sometimes be an "oppressive" exercise of government prosecutorial powers do need to be protected when circumstances so require. But just as we recognize this need, we also acknowledge that the State must likewise be accorded due process. Thus, when there is no showing of nefarious irregularity or manifest error in the performance of a public prosecutor's duties, courts ought to refrain from interfering with such lawfully and judicially mandated duties.
[32]
A defect in procedure is not automatically assumed as a deprivation of what is at most a statutory right. Irregularities in the executive determination of probable cause do not necessarily affect the judicial determination of probable cause. Once the Sandiganbayan has determined that there is probable cause to issue the warrant of arrest, any question as to the conduct of the preliminary investigation is already moot.
Accordingly, I vote to 
DENY
 the Petition for Certiorari. The Sandiganbayan should proceed with the resolution of Criminal Case Nos. SB-17-CRM-0642 to 0643 and Criminal Case Nos. SB-17-CRM-0644 to 0645 with due and deliberate dispatch.
