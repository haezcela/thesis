PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ERNESTO VENTURA, SR., ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

REYES, J.:


Accused-appellant Ernesto Ventura, Sr. (Ventura) challenges in this appeal the Decision
[1]
 dated April 13, 2012 promulgated by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 04133, which affirmed with modification the judgment
[2]
 of conviction for Rape rendered against him on May 27, 2009 by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of ParaÃ±aque City, Branch 194, in Criminal Case No. 05-0366.
[3]
Through the testimonies of the victim herself (AAA),
[4]
 her aunt BBB,
[5]
 
Barangay Tanod
 Ronaldo Antiporda (Antiporda),
[6]
 and the medico legal officer,
[7]
 the prosecutionâs case was summarized as follows:
On March 24, 2005, at about 2:00 a.m., BBB had just came from a wake and was passing by the bakery of Venturaâs son when she saw Ventura, naked from waist down, on top of a woman on a bench in front of the bakery. BBB coughed to get their attention and Ventura immediately stood up, put on his pants and entered his house. BBB then realized that the woman was her niece, AAA, who was then only 17 years old, unschooled and has a mental disability. She then held AAAâs hands and brought her home. Thereafter, BBB confronted AAA who confessed that she was already impregnated by Ventura and admitted that the latter was sexually abusing her. Upon learning this, BBB sought help from the employer of AAAâs sister who accompanied them to the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) to file a complaint
[8]
 against Ventura.
[9]
Thereafter, the members of the CIDG went to AAAâs 
barangay
 hall, and Antiporda was one of the 
barangay tanods
 who was tasked to escort them to the residence of Ventura. Antiporda testified that upon arriving at Venturaâs house, he informed Ventura of the complaint against him and invited the latter to the 
barangay
 hall. Ventura, with his wife, voluntarily went with them. At the 
barangay
 hall, the wife of Ventura approached AAA and asked her for forgiveness.
[10]
AAA narrated that she was near the bakery of Venturaâs son when Ventura asked her to lie down on the bench. Ventura undressed her, went on top of her, and inserted his penis inside her vagina. After succeeding in having carnal knowledge of her, Ventura threatened AAA by poking a knife at her while instructing her not to tell anyone about the incident.
[11]
 She was then forced by Ventura to accompany him in selling
 pandesal 
until the early morning, and she could not escape him because he was holding her hands and would not let her go.
[12]
 AAA said that Ventura would give her clothes and money every time he would rape her and instructed her not to tell anyone of the sexual assaults.
[13]
The Medico Legal Officer of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory testified that based on his interview with AAA, he found out that AAA was mentally deficient.
[14]
 His initial and final medico legal report revealed that AAA was already pregnant and that there was definite evidence of abuse or sexual contact.
[15]
For his part, Ventura
[16]
 denied the charge against him and invoked the defense of 
alibi
 alleging that he did not rape AAA on March 24, 2005 as he did not leave his home because he was busy making bread for their bakery with his children, and it was already 10:00 a.m. when he was able to leave their bakery. He also admitted having knowledge that AAA has a mental defect.
[17]
After trial, the RTC rendered judgment
[18]
 on May 27, 2009, convicting Ventura of the crime charged and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, and ordered him to pay AAA by way of damages the amount of P100,000.00. The trial court viewed the findings of the medico legal officer that AAA was already pregnant at the time of her physical and medical examination as clear proof and manifestation that she is a victim of rape, particularly in her case who was then only 17 years old, mentally deficient, illiterate, unschooled, and thus, incapable of giving rational consent to any lascivious act or sexual intercourse. The trial court also noted that Ventura failed to present any defense as to the explicit testimony of AAA that she was also sexually abused by him on other occasions since the only denial he interposed was against the consummated rape done on March 24, 2005.
On appeal, the CA affirmed the decision of the trial court with modification as to the award of damages. The CA ordered Ventura to pay the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.
[19]
 Ventura then appealed his conviction to this Court.
[20]
The Issue
Whether the guilt of Ventura for the crime charged has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.
The Courtâs Rulings
The appeal lacks merit.
In the Information
[21]
 filed before the RTC on March 31, 2005, Ventura was charged with rape of a demented person under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), to wit:
That on or about the 24
th
 day of March 2005, in the City of Para[Ã±]aque, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, having moral ascendancy, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of victim [AAA], 17[-]year old minor, 
a demented person
 and with mental capacity below 18 years old, against her will and without her consent, 
the accused knowing the victimâs mental disability at the time of the commission of the crime
, which acts are demeaning to the demented minor.
[22]
 (Emphasis ours)
Article 266-A, paragraph 1
[23]
 of the RPC, as amended, provides for two circumstances when having carnal knowledge of a woman with a mental disability is considered rape, to wit: paragraph 1(b) â when the offended party is deprived of reason; and paragraph 1(d) â when the offended party is demented.
Under paragraph 1(d), the term 
demented
 refers to a person who has dementia, which is a condition of deteriorated mentality, characterized by marked decline from the individualâs former intellectual level and often by emotional apathy, madness, or insanity. On the other hand, under paragraph 1(b), the phrase
 deprived of reason
 has been interpreted to include those suffering from mental abnormality, deficiency, or retardation.
[24]
 Since AAA is mentally deficient, she should properly be classified as a person who is âdeprived of reason,â and not one who is âdemented.â Hence, carnal knowledge of a mentally deficient individual is rape under subparagraph b and not subparagraph d of Article 266-A(1) of the RPC, as amended.
[25]
 Nevertheless, the erroneous reference to paragraph 1(d) in the Information will not exonerate Ventura because he failed to raise this as an objection, and the particular facts stated in the Information were protestation sufficient to inform him of the nature of the charge against him.
From the foregoing, all that needs to be proven are the facts of sexual congress between the rapist and his victim, and the latterâs mental retardation.
[26]
 This Court has repeatedly held that âmental retardation can be proven by evidence other than medical/clinical evidence, such as the testimony of witnesses and even the observation by the trial court.â
[27]
 The trial judgeâs assessment of the credibility of witnessesâ testimonies is accorded great respect on appeal in the absence of grave abuse of discretion on its part, it having had the advantage of actually examining both real and testimonial evidence including the demeanor of the witnesses.
[28]
 The rule finds an even more stringent application where the said findings are sustained by the appellate court.
In the present case, the prosecution was able to establish that AAA is, indeed, a mental retardate through the testimony of BBB and the medico legal officer, and the trial courtâs observation. It is also worthy to note that the defense did not dispute but even admitted the fact that AAA is suffering from mental retardation. Though AAA proceeded with much difficulty in describing the sexual abuse made on her, no convincing reason can be appreciated to warrant a departure from the findings of the trial court with respect to the assessment of her testimony, the same being straightforward, candid, and worthy of belief. This Court is also convinced that AAA has no ill-motive to manufacture such a tale if it were not true.
In impugning AAAâs accusation of rape against him, Ventura interposed the defense of denial and 
alibi.
 As can be gleaned from the records of this case, Venturaâs argument centered only on the fact that it was impossible for him to rape AAA on the said date and time of the incident because he was busy making bread at their bakery, and the only time he left their house was at 10:00 a.m. Even assuming that he worked inside their bakery the whole day, it was not impossible for him to commit the crime because the rape took place on the bench located just in front of their bakery.
The fact that no consummated rape happened on March 24, 2005 based on the testimonies of BBB and the medico legal officer, as well as the absence of lacerations on AAAâs vagina, pointed to by Ventura cannot work in his favor. The absence of hymenal lacerations on AAAâs vagina upon medical examination does not negate the fact of rape. A freshly broken hymen is not also an essential element of rape.
[29]
 In the context it is used in the RPC, carnal knowledge does not necessarily require that the vagina be penetrated or that the hymen be ruptured.
[30]
AAAâs failure to recall the exact date of the first rape and the number of times she was sexually assaulted by Ventura prior to March 24, 2005, does not militate against her credibility since rape victims are not expected to cherish in their memories an accurate account of the dates, number of times and manner they were violated.
[31]
 This is especially true in the case of AAA who obviously cannot be expected to act like an adult who would have the courage and intelligence to disregard the threat to her life and complain immediately that she had been sexually assaulted. AAAâs testimony was clear that every time Ventura would rape her, he would threaten her against revealing the offense. Given AAAâs mental condition, it can well substitute for violence and intimidation enough to cow her into submission.
The Court had repeatedly held that the exact date when the victim was sexually abused is not an essential element of the crime of rape,
[32]
 for the gravamen of the offense is carnal knowledge of a woman. Indeed, the precise time of the crime has no substantial bearing on its commission. As such, the time or place of commission in rape cases need not be accurately stated.
[33]
 Inconsistencies and discrepancies as to minor matters which are irrelevant to the elements of the crime cannot be considered grounds for acquittal.
[34]
 Hence, the allegation in the information under Criminal Case No. 05-0366, which states that the rape was committed on or about March 24, 2005, is sufficient to affirm the conviction of Ventura in the said case.
Lastly, the trial court had observed that Venturaâs actions were detested by his family because despite having a large kin,
[35]
 none of them testified for Venturaâs defense or did anything to support his case. They did not even bother to visit him while he was in jail.
[36]
In sum, the defense of denial as well as the points advanced by Ventura miserably failed to cast doubt on his culpability. The prosecution was able to prove that Ventura is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(b) of the RPC, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8353. Taking into consideration the presence of the special qualifying circumstance of Venturaâs knowledge of AAAâs mental deficiency, the same being properly alleged in the Information charging the appellant of the crime of rape and proven during trial, this Court has no option but to impose on the appellant the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 in accordance with Section 2 of R.A. No. 9346.
