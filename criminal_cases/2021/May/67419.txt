[ G.R. No. 207249, May 14, 2021 ]


ZENAIDA LAYSON VDA. DE MANJARES, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
DECISION




CAGUIOA, J:


Before the Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 filed by the petitioner Zenaida Layson Vda. de Manjares (Zenaida) assailing the Decision
[2]
 dated November 12, 2012 and Resolution
[3]
 dated May 20, 2013 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 33373, which affirmed the Judgment
[4]
 dated March 18, 2010 of Branch 14, Regional Trial Court of Ligao City (RTC) in Criminal Case No. 3840 convicting Zenaida for 
estafa
, penalized under Article 315(l)(b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).


The Facts



A Information for 
estafa
 was filed against Zenaida, the accusatory portion of which reads:


That sometime on September 12, 1996 up to and including 
October 4, 1998, in the Municipality of Polangui, Province of Albay, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above named accused, having received in trust or administration from 
PAULO P. BALLESTEROS JR. various appliances, furnitures, motorcycles, 
and other similar products with a total value of SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY 
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED ELEVEN PESOS and FIFTY NINE CENTAVOS 
(P730,811.59), for the purpose of selling the same on consignment basis,
 under the express obligation of turning over and/or deposit to the bank
 the next banking day the proceeds of the said items, if sold, or return
 them, if not sold, to the said Paulo P. Ballesteros Jr., but once in 
possession of the said items and far from complying with her obligation 
aforesaid, the said accused, with abuse of confidence, did then and 
there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously misappropriate, misapply and
 convert the said amount to her personal use and benefit and despite 
repeated demands to remit the proceeds of the sale, if any, and/or 
return the items, if unsold, failed, and refused and still fails and 
refuses to do so, to the damage and prejudice of said Paulo P. 
Ballesteros, Jr. in the sum of P730,811.59.




ALL ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.
[5]


During the arraignment, Zenaida pleaded not guilty. The private 
prosecutor then filed a manifestation, reserving the right of the 
complainant Paulo P. Ballesteros, Jr. (Ballesteros) to institute a 
separate civil action for damages.
[6]
 Pre-trial and trial thereafter ensued.



The prosecution presented as witnesses the following: (1) Rafael 
Roderick Pan (Pan), the auditor who audited Alson's Polangui; (2) 
Rodilyn Repuyan (Repuyan), secretary and cashier at Alson's Polangui; 
(3) Pablo H. Mendoza (Mendoza), (4) Rodrigo Valenciano (Valenciano), and
 (5) Antonio Nobles,
[7]
 former
 customers of Alson's Polangui; and (6) Ballesteros, the owner of 
Alson's Trading and Alson's Polangui. On the other hand, Zenaida was the
 only witness for the defense.



Based on the testimonies of both Zenaida and Ballesteros, the former was
 initially engaged in the business of buying-and-selling of appliances, 
furniture, and other products. She would buy from Ballesteros' business Â­
 Alson's Trading in Iriga City - around once a month. Because she had 
become a regular customer, she and Ballesteros had an agreement that her
 store would be used to establish Alson's Polangui and that she would be
 its branch manager.
[8]
 
According to Ballesteros, Zenaida had the following obligations as the 
branch manager: "1) receive the stocks; 2) sell and document them 
properly, following the standard pricing for cash or installment; 3) 
hire and terminate employees; 4) document and deposit collections in the
 bank the next banking day; and 5) be accountable for any shortages in 
the collection."
[9]
 Meanwhile,
 Ballesteros' obligation was to pay the monthly salaries of Zenaida and 
the other employees. According to Zenaida, she assumed the payment of 
the rent and the telephone bills, while Ballesteros shouldered the 
electric bills.
[10]
 
Ballesteros claimed however that he was paying the rent for the space 
but that he paid it through Zenaida as she was the one who had the lease
 agreement with the lessor.
[11]





Ballesteros narrated in his testimony that he visited Alson's Polangui 
one time and he did not find any cash there. He grew suspicious, so he 
asked Pan to conduct a preliminary audit. The preliminary audit revealed
 a shortage of around P65,000.00 per month of operation. He confronted 
Zenaida about this, and she allegedly promised to pay the shortages back
 within 15 days. Meanwhile, Ballesteros asked Pan to conduct an audit of
 the branch's entire operation from September 12, 1996 to October 4, 
1998.
[12]
 Based on Pan's audit, Zenaida's total accountability was allegedly P730,811.59, broken down as follows:
[13]








Undeposited Net Collection for the Day


P143,100.63

TOTAL 


P730,811.59
[14]







"Undeposited Net Collection for the Day" refers to the total amount of 
the daily net collections of Alson's Polangui which were not deposited 
in the bank at all.
[15]
 "Net 
Short Deposit of Collections" represents "short deposits," meaning the 
amounts deposited to the bank account were less than the total 
collections for a given period.
[16]

 Pan arrived at this by comparing the columnar logbooks - which 
contained the details of the sales made in Alson's Polangui - prepared 
by Repuyan, the cashier/secretary, 
vis-a-vis
 the bank statements containing the amounts that Zenaida deposited.
[17]






 


"Disallowed Payments of Salesman Commission" refers to amounts paid to 
supposed agents who solicited customers of Alson's Polangui, but it was 
later on discovered that either the agents were fictitious, or the 
agents did not in fact receive said amounts.
[18]

 "Unreplaced Bounced Check Used for Liquidation of Stocks" refers to the
 amount representing the payment of four customers who paid in cash, but
 instead of depositing the cash, Zenaida deposited a personal check 
covering the amount which was subsequently dishonored for insufficient 
funds.
[19]



"Unreceipted/Undeposited C.O.D. Sales" refers to amounts representing 
items delivered to customers, proven through delivery receipts issued to
 them, but which were not recorded in the columnar logbook prepared by 
Repuyan.
[20]
 "Customers with Remaining Balance but has (
sic
)
 Fully Paid" refers to installment payments by customers which were not 
recorded and also unremitted to Ballesteros' bank account.
[21]

 "Current Cost of Unaccounted Stocks" refers to the value of stocks 
delivered to Alson's Polangui which can no longer be found or accounted 
for during the audit.
[22]
 
"Unaccounted Stocks Delivered to Customers" refers to the value of 
stocks delivered to customers which were not reported as sales.
[23]

 "Charges for Unaccounted Repossessed Units" refers to the value of 
stocks repossessed by Alson's Polangui for failure of the buyer to pay 
the installment payments, which stocks were unaccounted for during the 
audit.
[24]



"Short Remittances for C.O.D. Sales" refers to the amounts representing 
the difference between the amount in the delivery receipts given to the 
customers, and the amount reflected in the office copy of such receipts.
 The office copies of the receipts, which were the bases of the 
remittances to Ballesteros' bank account, reflected smaller amounts 
compared to the ones given to the customers.
[25]

 Finally, "Price Difference/Excess Payments for Confirmed Installment 
Sales but are Reported as C.O.D. Sales" refers to installment sales 
which were reported as C.O.D. or cash-an-delivery sales. Reporting them 
as C.O.D. sales deprived Alson's Polangui of the mark-up since the 
prices of stocks were higher when paid on installment instead of cash.
[26]


The above audit conducted by Pan became the basis of Zenaida's 
accountabilities, and subsequently, of the criminal charge against her.


Meanwhile, Repuyan, the cashier/secretary of Alson's Polangui, testified
 that her main duties are: "issuance of receipts to customers; 
preparation of documents for delivery of stocks; and collection of 
remittances from customers."
[27]
 She claimed that she religiously remitted the collections to Zenaida who, in turn, issued her acknowledgment receipts.
[28]

 It would then be Zenaida's duty to deposit the collections to 
Ballesteros' bank account. When asked about the acknowledgment receipts 
that Zenaida supposedly executed, as well as the columnar logbook she 
prepared for Alson's Polangui, Repuyan testified:


x x x She explained though, that she failed to produce the 
acknowledgment receipts during the audit because the original copies 
were borrowed by the daughter of [Zenaida], Swisa Manjares King sometime
 in September but who, upon demand, refused to return them until now. 
The photocopies of said acknowledgment receipts kept in the drawer of 
her table were also lost, hence, she had the incident recorded (Exhibit 
TT) in the police blotter. [Zenaida] had all the original keys in the 
office, while she had the duplicate. At the time of said loss, [Zenaida]
 was still reporting in the office. Only [Zenaida] deposits the 
collections in the bank, the Philippine National Bank, Polangui Branch, 
or Legazpi Savings Bank, [Polangui] Branch.


Cross-examined, witness explained that she reported the loss of the 
acknowledgment receipts only on October 12, 1998, despite their loss on 
September 26, 1998, because she thought Swisa Manjares King would still 
return them. She did not, however, require Swisa to sign any document to
 prove that she borrowed them nor was anybody present in the office when
 she lent them to her. She only made a verbal demand for the return of 
the acknowledgment receipts. Neither did she have Swisa summoned by the 
Barangay Captain or the police. She admitted that when the audit started
 in July, 1998, [Zenaida] was no longer "active" in the office.


On redirect, witness clarified that although [Zenaida] ceased to be branch manager from July, 1998, she was still reported (
sic
)
 to the office because she resigned only on October 19, 1998. Despite 
the loss of the [acknowledgment] receipts, the columnar books for the 
year 1997 (Exhibit D-52 up to D-70) and 1998 (Exhibit D-71 up to D-72) 
reflected the amounts of her remittances to [Zenaida] on a day-to-day 
basis. She started recording the amounts of her remittances [Zenaida] 
from December 18, 1996 (Exhibit D-18) up to July 21, 1998 (Exhibit 
D-73).


On re-cross examination, witness reiterated that [Zenaida] still 
reported to the office every day from July to October, 1998. She 
confirmed the signature of Marilou Manjares, daughter of [Zenaida] 
appearing in one entry (Exhibit D-45) in the columnar book. She admitted
 that the amounts for deposit as stated in the columnar books was no 
proof that they were received by [Zenaida]. She explained though, that 
[Zenaida] does not need to sign the columnar book because she instead 
issued [acknowledgment] receipts.


Clarified by the court, witness revealed that it was Mr. Ballesteros who
 required the audit when he suspected some irregularities committed by 
[Zenaida] in the management of the branch. She further explained that 
[Zenaida] owned the office table where the acknowledgment receipts were 
kept, hence, the latter has duplicate keys to the drawers. She admitted 
her mistake in having lent the original receipts to the daughter of 
[Zenaida] and keeping the photocopies in the drawer to which the 
[Zenaida] had a key. In the morning of September 25, Swisa borrowed the 
receipts upon request of [Zenaida], promising to return them the 
following morning. However, Swisa no longer returned them despite her 
demands. She agreed that without the receipts, she cannot prove that she
 remitted all the money that came to her. She informed the auditor of 
the loss of the photocopies on September
27, 1998. She added that per company procedure, a copy of the deposit 
slip is given to her (witness) for checking if the amount therein 
corresponded to the amount in the acknowledgment receipt. The deposit 
slips covering December 18, 1996 up to July, 1998 were already submitted
 to the main office in Iriga City. She was not promoted after that 
"fiasco" in 1998.
[29]


As to the other witnesses from the prosecution, their testimonies were summarized by the RTC as follows:


PABLO H. MENDOZA
 x x x - He is one of the customers who bought a 
Sharp karaoke
.
 He identified and affirmed the veracity of his Certification issued on 
September 16, 1998. His Certification was about the karaoke he bought 
which was not repaired and remained in his possession until now. 
[Zenaida] transacted the purchase of said item to him. Upon its 
delivery, he paid Php1,000.00 to [Zenaida] and in June, Php1,400.00. All
 in all, Php2,400.00 but [Zenaida] did not issue receipts to him. 
Alson's was able to locate this karaoke because of the signature of his 
wife in the blank Delivery Receipt (Exhibit DD-2). He also signed blank 
documents, such as the Warranty Card, Delivery Receipt, Sales Invoice, 
Credit Application Sheet, Promissory Note, Chattel Mortgage, Application
 for Credit (Exhibit DD-1 up to DD-7).


When clarified by the court, he claimed to have given [Php1,000.00] to a
 certain Amor, an agent of Alson's Trading, who delivered the karaoke in
 his house but [Zenaida] was not present during the delivery. He later 
gave an additional [Php1,400.00] to Amor. He made the purchase only 
through brochures shown by Amor, without going to Alson's Polangui. He 
recalled signing the Promissory Note and Delivery Receipt when the unit 
was delivered by Amor in his house. He only went to Alson's when the 
unit became defective, which [Zenaida] promised to replace. When it was 
not replaced, he no longer made any payments.


RODRIGO VALENCIANO
 x x x - He is the husband of Lina Valenciano, 
who bought a Sony VHS player on installment from Alson's Trading 
Polangui, but which had been fully paid. He identified his wife's 
signature (Exhibit JJ-1) in the delivery receipt dated September, 1997. 
Other than that, he has no personal knowledge regarding the purchase and
 delivery of aforesaid item.


ANTONIO NOLES
 x x x - He purchased a TV set from Alson's Polangui
 branch in 1997, wherein [Zenaida] was the one who attended to him. As 
direct buyer, he paid a discounted price of [Php5,300.00], from the 
original price of [Php6,000] but the receipt given to him was already 
lost. Witness admitted that all he could recall was that he paid 
[Php5,300.00] for said appliance, although the delivery receipt (Exhibit
 UUU) he signed dated February 14, 1997 indicated the amount of 
[Php5,000.00].
[30]






 


For her defense, Zenaida took the witness stand and disclaimed liability
 over the amounts charged to her based on Pan's audit. According to her,
 Ballesteros told her to focus her attention outside the store to 
increase the sale of items in order to achieve the monthly sales quota. 
Hence, the transactions in the office were delegated to Repuyan, who was
 also tasked to issue receipts for payments made by the buyers.
[31]

 She also claimed to have deposited in Ballesteros' bank accounts all 
the collections remitted to her by Repuyan. She narrated that she did 
not sign or prepare any document for said amounts received for deposit, 
but she prepared three copies of deposit slips - one for the bank, one 
for Repuyan, and another for her own copy.
[32]
 Other than this, Repuyan had the duty of attending to the necessary documentation of sales in the office.
[33]



The case was then submitted for decision.


RULING OF THE RTC



The RTC issued the Judgment dated March 18, 2010, the dispositive portion of which states:


WHEREFORE
, under the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered:


a. Finding accused, ZENAIDA [LAYSON VDA DE MANJARES], GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
 ESTAFA
,
 defined and penalized under par. 1(b), Article 315, Revised Penal Code,
 for having misappropriated for her personal benefit and by means of 
deceit and/or abuse of confidence, the total amount of Six Hundred 
Ninety-Four Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven Pesos and Nine Centavos 
[(Php694,667.09)], from Alson's Trading, Polangui Branch, owned by Mr. 
Paulo Ballesteros, Jr.; thereby, sentencing accused to suffer the 
indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from TEN (10) YEARS of 
prision mayor
 as minimum, to FIFTEEN (15) YEARS of 
reclusion temporal
 as maximum, with the accessory penalties therewith, as provided by law.




b.  On account of the express reservation and institution by complainant
 of a separate civil action for the crime herein charged, no finding or 
award of civil damages is made.


SO ORDERED.
[34]


The RTC convicted Zenaida, ruling that the evidence established by the prosecution established all the elements of the crime of 
estafa
.
 The RTC, however, held that the amount misappropriated by Zenaida was 
only P694,667.09 based on the evidence presented by the prosecution.

 



 




Aggrieved, Zenaida appealed to the CA.


RULING OF THE CA



In the Decision dated November 12, 2012, the CA affirmed Zenaida's conviction 
in toto
. The CA also found that all the elements of 
estafa
 were present. Zenaida sought reconsideration, but the CA denied this in the Resolution dated May 20, 2013.


Hence, the instant appeal.


ISSUE



For resolution of the Court is whether the CA erred in affirming Zenaida's conviction for 
estafa
.


THE COURT'S RULING



The appeal is meritorious. The Court reverses Zenaida's conviction for 
estafa
.



The elements of 
estafa
 through conversion or misappropriation, punished under Article 315(l)(b) of the RPC are:


(1) that personal property is received in trust, on 
commission, for administration or under any other circumstance involving
 the duty to make delivery of or to return the same, even though the 
obligation is guaranteed by a bond;


(2) that there is conversion or diversion of such property by the person
 who has so received it or a denial on his part that he received it;


(3) that such conversion, diversion or denial is to the injury of another; and


(4) that there be demand for the return of the property.
[35]


In the case at bar, the Court finds that not all the elements of 
estafa
 are present. Particularly, the first two elements of 
estafa
 were not established.






First element: That 
personal property is received in trust, on commission, for 
administration, or under any other circumstance involving the duty to 
make delivery of or to return the same


 







Anent the first element, when "the money, goods, or any other personal 
property is received by the offender from the offended party (1) in 
trust or (2) on commission or (3) for administration, the offender 
acquires 
both material or physical possession 
and juridical possession
 of the thing received
."
[36]



The RTC, in explaining the existence of the first element, explained:


Finally, when [Zenaida] received the stocks delivered, she 
acquired not only the physical but also the juridical possession 
thereof. This is so because upon receipt of the stocks, a fiduciary 
relationship was created whereby [Zenaida] had the duty to sell the 
stocks and remit the proceeds thereof to Alson's bank account or, to 
return/account those not sold, upon demand. 
[Zenaida] herself 
acknowledged such juridical possession when she admitted on 
cross-examination, that it was her obligation to sell the products and 
remit their proceeds to Mr. Ballesteros.
[37]
 (Underscoring supplied)



The CA, in its Decision, simply affirmed the RTC and concluded that 
Zenaida received the goods "in trust" from Ballesteros but did not 
elaborate as to its basis.



The Court, however, finds that Zenaida only had material possession, and
 not juridical possession, of the goods delivered to her for sale in 
Alson's Polangui.



It is undisputed that Zenaida was the "branch manager" of Alson's 
Polangui. Unfortunately, Ballesteros and Zenaida did not have a written 
agreement as to what Zenaida's responsibilities were; thus, the evidence
 in this case hinged altogether on testimonial evidence. The 
prosecution's own evidence, presented through the testimony of 
Ballesteros, is as follows:


Asked by the court, complainant maintained that from the time [Zenaida] started managing Alson's Polangui branch, 
he had an employerÂ­ employee relationship with her
. As his employee, she was 
paid a monthly salary

 of (Php5,000.00], plus additional benefits if she meets the sales quota
 of almost half a million pesos in a month, at that time. 
He was 
the one who paid the salaries of the secretary/cashier and utility and 
the monthly rental of [Php2,000.00] for the store space
, which rental was paid through [Zenaida] because it was she who had a (lease) contract with the Bichara family.


Cross-examined, Mr. Ballesteros averred that when Alson's Polangui started its operation, 
he already prevented [Zenaida] from continuing with her previous business of buying and selling appliances
,
 because it was incompatible to his business. There was no written 
employment contract with [Zenaida] and all instructions to her were also
 verbal. 
[Zenaida] directly reported to him about the operation of the business.

 While he delegated to [Zenaida] the selection of a SecretaryÂ­Cashier 
and Utility, he was the one who explained to the latter their duties and
 functions in the office.
[38]
 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)







 


The foregoing testimony was corroborated by Zenaida and Repuyan, both of
 whom essentially testified that Ballesteros had control over the 
operations of Alson's Polangui through his verbal instructions. To the 
mind of the Court, these testimonies establish that Zenaida was a mere 
employee Â­ 
not an agent
 - of Ballesteros and Alson's Polangui.



In 
Chua-Burce v. Court of Appeals
,
[39]
 the Court, citing 
People v. Locson
[40]
 and 
Guzman v. Court of Appeals
,
[41]

 emphasized that "[j]uridical possession means a possession which gives 
the transferee a right over the thing which the transferee may set up 
even against the owner."
[42]
 The Court held that the cash custodian of a bank who misappropriated the bank's funds was not guilty of 
estafa

 for she only had material possession of the missing funds. The Court 
explained the distinction between material possession and juridical 
possession in this wise:


There is an essential distinction between the possession by a
 receiving teller of funds received from third persons paid to the bank,
 and an agent who receives the proceeds of sales of merchandise 
delivered to him in agency by his principal. In the former case, payment
 by third persons to the teller is payment to the bank itself; the 
teller is a mere custodian or keeper of the funds received, and has no 
independent right or title to retain or possess the same as against the 
bank. 
An agent, on the other hand, can even assert, as against his 
own principal, an independent, autonomous, right to retain money or 
goods received in consequence of the agency; as when the principal fails
 to reimburse him for advances he has made, and indemnify him for 
damages suffered without his fault.
[43]
 (Emphasis supplied)



In the present case, the records are bereft of any evidence pointing to 
an existence of agency between Zenaida and Ballesteros. There is 
likewise no proof that Zenaida received the items delivered to Alson's 
Polangui on consignment basis, or that any title passed to her by virtue
 of the said delivery. The Court cannot find anything which indicates 
that Zenaida would have independent title over the goods as against 
Ballesteros. Ballesteros had (1) the power to control the operations of 
Alson's Polangui, (2) the power to control what Zenaida could and could 
not do, and (3) the responsibility to pay the salaries of all Alson's 
Polangui's employees, including Zenaida. The foregoing indicates the 
existence of employer-employee relationship between Ballesteros and 
Zenaida. Thus, the Court holds that Zenaida did not have juridical 
possession of the goods delivered to her.





The first element of 
estafa
 is therefore absent. On this ground 
alone, Zenaida should already be acquitted. The Court deems it prudent, 
however, to discuss the absence of the second element to further bolster
 the fact that there is reasonable doubt on Zenaida's criminal 
liability.






Second element: conversion or diversion of such property by the person who has so received it


 







As to the second element,


the words "convert" and "misappropriate" connote an act of 
using or disposing of another's property as if it were one's own, or of 
devoting it to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon. To 
misappropriate to one's own use includes, not only conversion to one's 
personal advantage, but also every attempt to dispose of the property of
 another without right.
[44]



After a review of the evidence, the Court finds that the prosecution 
failed to establish the existence of misappropriation beyond reasonable 
doubt. On this score, the Court deems it proper to illustrate the 
failure of the evidence to establish Zenaida's guilt through each of the
 items in Pan's audit:


A. "Undeposited Net Collection for the Day"

B. "Net Short Deposit of Collection for the Day"



For these two items, Zenaida's liability was determined by comparing the
 amounts in Repuyan's columnar logbook vis-a-vis the amounts deposited 
by Zenaida to Ballesteros' bank accounts as indicated in the deposit 
slips. The difference in the amounts were held to be misappropriated by 
Zenaida. The RTC gave credence to the columnar logbooks because they 
were "entries in the course of business" following the Rule 130, Section
 43 of the 1989 Rules on Evidence.
[45]



The RTC and the CA erred in anchoring Zenaida's criminal liability on 
the entries in Repuyan's columnar logbook. To recall, Repuyan herself 
testified that she was in charge of "issuance of receipts to customers; 
preparation of documents for delivery of stocks; and collection of 
remittances from customers."
[46]
 In addition, Ballesteros testified that although he authorized Zenaida to hire a utility and secretary/cashier, 
he specifically instructed Repuyan to be the one to receive the payments and deposit the collections in the bank
. But since he seldom visited the branch, he later discovered that Zenaida was the one depositing the collections in the bank.
[47]





From the testimonies of Repuyan, Ballesteros, and Zenaida, it appears 
that it was Repuyan who transacted with the buyers. Repuyan was the one 
in charge of receiving the payment from buyers and issuing the 
corresponding receipts. She would then make an entry into the columnar 
logbook, and remit the collections to Zenaida, who would then deposit 
the money in Ballesteros' bank accounts. Accomplishing the columnar 
logbooks and making entries therein were, therefore, 
solely
 under Repuyan's control. Zenaida had no hand in their preparation, and neither were they ever signed by her.



Instead, Repuyan claimed that when she would remit money to Zenaida, the
 latter would issue acknowledgement receipts to her. When asked to 
present these acknowledgment receipts to prove that Zenaida indeed 
received the exact amotmts reflected in the columnar logbooks, she 
stated that Zenaida's daughter, Swisa Manjares King (Swisa), had 
borrowed and had never returned the originals. She also stated that she 
had photocopies of these acknowledgment receipts, but they were also 
lost because she kept them in a drawer that Zenaida had access to. All 
of these claims, however, were uncorroborated. Zenaida denied executing 
acknowledgement receipts, and claimed to only execute three deposit 
slips each time Repuyan would remit money to her for deposit. No one 
also witnessed that Swisa indeed borrowed the originals, if they even 
really existed.





Given the foregoing, the columnar logbooks are worthless in proving that
 Zenaida received more than what she deposited in Ballesteros' bank 
accounts. That the columnar logbooks were "entries in the course of 
business" is immaterial, for such evidentiary rule only determines the 
admissibility of the logbooks, not their evidentiary weight. The 
prosecution was not able to prove that the amounts in the columnar 
logbooks exactly reflects what Zenaida received. Repuyan herself 
"admitted that amounts for deposit as stated in the columnar books was 
no proof that they were received by [Zenaida]."
[48]





To emphasize, the preparation and accomplishment of the columnar 
logbooks was under the responsibility and control of Repuyan alone. 
Under the rule on 
res inter alios acta
, "the rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another."
[49]

 Hence, the columnar logbooks, accomplished completely by a third 
person, cannot prejudice Zenaida. Simply put, the columnar logbooks, by 
themselves, cannot be used as the basis to determine her liability.



Considering that the evidence to rebut her innocence were the columnar 
logbooks - basically self-serving documents by Repuyan - then it was 
error for the RTC and the CA that Zenaida's guilt was proven beyond 
reasonable doubt.



At this juncture, it is important to point out a glaring fact which both
 the RTC and the CA missed. In her testimony, Repuyan admitted that "per
 company procedure, 
a copy of the deposit slip is given to her x x x 
for checking if the amount therein corresponded to the amount in the 
[acknowledgment] receipt
."
[50]

 If Zenaida truly did not deposit certain amounts, or she deposited less
 than what she received from Repuyan, then the latter would have been 
easily alerted of the same. A simple comparison between her copy of the 
deposit slips, on the one hand, and the columnar logbooks and the 
acknowledgment receipts, on the other, would have enabled her to notice 
that Zenaida was pocketing money that rightfully belonged to 
Ballesteros. Yet, she alerted no one, and it was not until Ballesteros 
asked Pan to conduct an audit of Alson's Polangui that the 
irregularities were supposedly discovered. This glaring fact all the 
more points to the plausibility of Zenaida's defense: that she was 
depositing in Ballesteros' bank accounts all the collections that 
Repuyan remitted to her.


C. "Disallowed Payment of Salesman Commission"



To recall, these refer to amounts which were paid to fictitious agents, 
or the agents themselves claimed to have not received the amounts as 
stated. The amounts paid were culled by Pan from "receivable cards" of 
customers. Meanwhile, Zenaida disclaimed any knowledge of such payments,
 pointing out that agents transacted directly with Repuyan.
[51]



Similar to the first two items, these "receivable cards" cannot be made a
 basis for Zenaida's criminal liability. The prosecution did not present
 any evidence that Zenaida had any participation in making entries in 
the said "receivable cards." It is well to remember that, based on the 
testimonies of Zenaida, Ballesteros, and Repuyan, it was Repuyan who was
 in charge of preparing documents relative to the payments of customers.
 There is no evidence on record that Zenaida dealt with the agents 
themselves. Moreover, there is also doubt on whether there were agents 
who did not receive their commissions. The prosecution only presented 
Pan to testify to this fact in the course of testifying on his audit 
findings. The agents who claimed that they did not receive anything, 
however, were never presented in court. They were therefore not 
cross-examined regarding their claims. Thus, the finding that these 
agents did not receive their commissions is supported by mere hearsay 
evidence which has no probative weight.




D. "Unreplaced Bounced Check Used for Liquidation of Stocks"



For this item, it was alleged that there was a check for P10,000.00 that
 was returned for insufficient funds. The allegation was that Zenaida 
transacted with four customers, all of whom paid in cash for a total of 
P9,991.00. Instead of depositing it directly into Ballesteros' bank 
account, she deposited the check into said bank account, which check was
 returned for insufficient funds.



Once again, this cannot be used to adjudge Zenaida guilty of the charge.
 First of all, the prosecution did not present anything to prove this 
allegation apart from Pan's testimony The prosecution did not present 
the check itself or any other document from the bank proving that the 
check bounced.



As well, it is worth to recall that based on the testimonial evidence in
 this case, it was Repuyan who was transacting with customers. In fact, 
as Zenaida pointed out, the delivery receipts issued to the four 
customers were not signed by her.
[52]

 Moreover, there is a discrepancy, albeit minimal, between the amounts 
allegedly collected as compared to the one Zenaida tried to deposit. Why
 would Zenaida try to deposit P10,000, when what was supposedly 
given to her was merely P9,991.00?



Given the foregoing, the Court finds that there is very serious doubt as to Zenaida's accountability on this item.


E. "Unreceipted/Undeposited C.O.D. Sales"



The amounts charged against Zenaida on this item were again obtained 
from the colunmar logbooks. These refer to items which were traced to 
have been delivered to customers but there were no entries in the 
colunmar logbooks representing said sales.



To prove that Zenaida had a general practice of receiving money without 
issuing receipts, the prosecution presented Mendoza, a customer, on the 
witness stand. However, his testimony did not prove anything considering
 that upon clarification during cross-examination, it was revealed that 
Mendoza never personally gave money to Zenaida. As narrated in the facts
 above, his testimony was that in the two instances when he paid money 
to Alson's Polangui but was not issued any receipt, he handed the money 
to a certain "Amor," not to Zenaida.



It is clear from the foregoing alone that the evidence was utterly 
wanting as regards Zenaida's liability under this item. It is worth to 
reiterate that Zenaida did not have any participation in the preparation
 of the logbooks. Repuyan was in charge of "preparation of documents for
 delivery of stocks"
[53]
 and 
was in full control of what was entered into the logbooks. Zenaida 
cannot be adjudged criminally liable based on the acts of another 
person, unless there is a finding of conspiracy between them. There 
being none in this case, Zenaida must be absolved of criminal liability 
in this item.


F. "Customers with Remaining Balance but has (sic) Fully Paid"



These refer to installment sales wherein the customers claimed to have 
already paid a larger amount than what was reflected in Alson's 
Polangui's records. For instance, there was one customer who claimed to 
have already paid P17,000.00, but the "index card" in the store's 
records, as well as the official receipts issued to the customer only 
reflected payments totaling P13,829.00.
[54]



These cannot also be charged to Zenaida. Apart from the lack of clear 
evidence of Zenaida' participation in the preparation of the "index 
cards," none of the customers alleged to have paid larger amounts were 
presented in court to testify on these allegations. The only evidence 
that these customers indeed paid a larger amount than what was reflected
 in the store's records was Pan's testimony as regards his investigation
 in connection to the audit he conducted. Similar to the alleged unpaid 
commissions of agents in item C, the testimony of Pan on this item is 
hearsay; therefore, devoid of any evidentiary weight even if it was 
admitted into evidence.


G. "Current Cost of Unaccounted Stocks"

H. "Charges for Unaccounted Repossessed Unit"



The amounts under these items represent the cost of goods that were 
confirmed to have been delivered to Alson's Polangui, or repossessed 
from customers by Alson's Polangui, all of which could no longer be 
accounted for when Pan was auditing the store. While Zenaida denied any 
liability for the goods under this item as the deliveries were handled 
by other employees of the store, the lower courts declared that Zenaida 
was liable because she was the store's branch manager. The RTC, in 
particular, held that Zenaida exercised control and supervision over the
 work of Repuyan and the other employees. Hence, she was ultimately 
liable for the loss of the goods.



The Court disagrees.



While Zenaida may be responsible for the goods as branch manager of the store, she may only, at most, be made liable 
civilly
 for the value of the goods based on the facts of this case. Zenaida cannot be made 
criminally

 liable for the loss of the goods, absent any proof that she converted, 
or misappropriated them. As earlier mentioned, Zenaida did not have 
juridical possession of the items. Thus, the legal presumption of 
misappropriation "when the accused fails to deliver the proceeds of the 
sale or to return the items to be sold and fails to give an account of 
their whereabouts"
[55]
 does not arise in this case. In other words, to make her 
criminally

 liable for the loss of the goods, it was incumbent upon the prosecution
 to offer evidence that it was she who took or misappropriated the goods
 - and not someone else who had access to the store. The reasoning of 
the lower courts effectively convicts Zenaida of 
estafa
 for her negligence as a branch manager which cannot be countenanced by the Court.


I. "Price Difference/Excess Payments for Unaccounted Stocks Confirmed to be Delivered to Customers"





For this item, the Court simply affirms the RTC's finding,
[56]
 as upheld by the CA, that the prosecution failed to offer any evidence to support this alleged accountability.


J. "Confirmed Short Remittance of C.O.D. Sales"

K. "Price Difference/Excess Payments for Confirmed Installment Sales but are Reported as C.O.D. Sales"





For these items, Zenaida's defense was that there was an agreement 
between her and Ballesteros that the amount of "overprice" would be 
given to her.
[57]
 She explained that she was allowed to get additional remuneration from the "overprice in the cash sales of appliances."
[58]

 She also explained that the customer copies of delivery receipts for 
cash transactions would reflect the "overprice" - the price as 
advertised - so that the buyer would not suspect that there was an 
"overprice."
[59]
 What was reflected in the office copy of the delivery receipts was the "listed company price" of the stocks being purchased.
[60]



The Court rules that there is also reasonable doubt on Zenaida's liability on this item.



The Court has, time and again, declared that if the inculpatory facts 
and circumstances are capable of two or more interpretations, one of 
which being consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other 
or others consistent with his guilt, then the evidence in view of the 
constitutional presumption of innocence has not fulfilled the test of 
moral certainty and is thus insufficient to support a conviction.
[61]



In this case, the inculpatory acts could be interpreted as evidence of 
estafa
,
 on the one hand, or could be perfectly explained by the agreement 
between Zenaida and Ballesteros, on the other. While Zenaida's defense 
appears like a convenient excuse, it is important to note that, as 
mentioned, Ballesteros and Zenaida did not have a written memorandum of 
their agreements. The Court, and even the lower courts, have had to rely
 only on the testimonies of the both of them to establish what their 
agreements were.



For this item, Zenaida insists that Ballesteros allowed her by agreement
 to charge an "overprice" as additional compensation. Meanwhile, 
Ballesteros did not have any testimony regarding the existence of such 
agreement. Neither has he denied its existence. Ballesteros only 
testified that he has prohibited Zenaida from further engaging in her 
buy-and-sell business when she started as his branch manager as he 
deemed it inconsistent with his business. To the mind of the Court, this
 further bolsters the possibility that Zenaida and Ballesteros indeed 
had an agreement so that the former could have additional compensation 
on top of her P5,000.00 monthly salary as his branch manager.



In sum, the Court rules that for this particular alleged accountability,
 there is reasonable doubt as to the guilt of Zenaida. To reiterate for 
emphasis, "
[i]f the evidence is susceptible of two interpretations, 
one consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other 
consistent with his guilt, the accused must be acquitted
."
[62]

 "The overriding consideration is not whether the court doubts the 
innocence of the accused but whether it entertains a reasonable doubt as
 to his guilt."
[63]


Conclusion



It must be clarified that the Court is not saying that Zenaida is, or 
should be, completely free from liability. The Court recognizes that 
Zenaida may be said to have been remiss in performing her duties as 
branch manager. Nevertheless, this only makes her possibly 
civilly

 liable to Ballesteros or Alson's Polangui. The Court, however, would 
not pronounce any civil liability in this case yet because Ballesteros 
properly reserved his right to file a separate civil action against 
Zenaida on the same set of facts.



The Court's pronouncement in this case is only limited to Zenaida's criminal liability for 
estafa
 - and from the foregoing discussions, it is clear that two of the elements of 
estafa
 were either not present or not sufficiently proven by the prosecution. As a result, Zenaida must perforce be acquitted.
