FIRST DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 247976, May 14, 2021 ]


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. EDILBERTO MANUEL, JR. Y MANGALINDAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
DECISION




GESMUNDO, C.J.:


Considering that the accused herein knew at the time of the incident 
that the victim suffered from some form of mental retardation, yet the 
same did not deter him from pursuing his bestial desires, the law thus 
imposes upon him a higher penalty for his uncompromising carnal 
motivations.


The Case



This is an appeal from the Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals (
CA
) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 09562, promulgated on December 17, 2018, which affirmed with modification the January 31, 2017 Decision
[2]
 of the Regional Trial Court, XXX,
[3]
 Branch 36 (
RTC
), finding Edilberto Manuel, Jr. 
y
 Mangalindan (
accused-appellant
) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Rape in Criminal Case No. 21532-2013-C.




Antecedents



Accused-appellant was charged with rape under the following allegations in the information, thus -


That [sometime] in January 2013 at [XXX] and within the 
jurisdiction of his Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then 
and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge of
 AAA,
[4]
 a fifteen[-]year old female minor deprived of reason, in violation of the aforementioned law.




That in the commission of the offense offender knew of the mental retardation of complainant.


ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.
[5]



Accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge and the case 
proceeded to trial. To prove its case, the prosecution presented the 
testimonies of the following: (1) AAA, the minor private complainant 
herself; (2) BBB,
[6]
 AAA's aunt (the sister of AAA's mother) and the person who took custody of AAA; (3) Dr. Roy Camarillo (
Dr. Camarillo
), the physician who approved the results of the physical examination conducted upon AAA; and (4) Dr. Joel Lazaro (
Dr. Lazaro
), a Development and Behavioral Pediatrician who diagnosed AAA with mental retardation.
[7]



Meanwhile, the defense presented accused-appellant's testimony and that of his live-in partner, CCC,
[8]
 the biological mother of AAA.
[9]








 
 




The CA summarized the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses in this manner:


AAA was born on March 11, 1997. Her biological mother is CCC
 and her birth certificate indicated that her father was unknown. When 
she was 6 years old, she was found to have a global pattern of 
developmental delay and had a developmental age of 3 to 3.5 years old. 
At 9 years old, she was diagnosed to have mental retardation with a 
developmental age of a 5-year old. On her follow-up visit at the age of 
16 years old, she was diagnosed to have a developmental age of 5 to 5.5 
years old. Initially, it was her grandparents who took care of her, but 
upon their death, BBB took over.



As aforesaid, accused-appellant is the live-in partner of CCC.


According to AAA, sometime in January 2013, herein accused-appellant, 
whom the former referred to as "Kuya Boy" or "Charles" touched her 
vagina, inserted his penis into her vagina, and kissed her on the cheek 
and the lips. Thereafter, he hit her at her thighs.





Because of AAA's mental condition, which Dr. Lazaro explained in his 
testimony, the public prosecutor, in a sketch of a male person, made AAA
 identify the male body part which accused-appellant inserted in her 
vagina. AAA then pointed to the male genitalia and referred to it as "
itlog
."
 When confronted with a female sketch, she was able to properly identify
 the vagina, and narrated that it was there where accused-appellant 
placed his "
itlog
."



AAA further testified that she lived in the same house with 
accused-appellant for quite some time; and that the latter repeatedly 
touched her private part. As accused-appellant threatened her, she did 
not report the incident to anyone. She was only 15 years old at the time
 of the incident.





The second witness, BBB testified that she took care of AAA since birth.
 Sometime in February 2013, she obtained information from her halfÂ­ 
sister's helper that she saw herein accused-appellant enter the room 
where AAA was lying on the bed and covered with a blanket; and that 
accused-appellant immediately locked the door thereafter. This led her 
to inquire from AAA about the incident, and the latter told her that 
accused-appellant inserted his finger into her private part and caressed
 it.





BBB then reported the incident to a certain Colonel Lumbres. Then BBB, 
together with AAA and their house helper, went to the barangay hall 
where they assisted by Barangay Captain [YYY].
[10]

 They were immediately referred to the officer of the Department of 
Social Welfare and Development Upon request by the Police Superintendent
 of the [XXX] Police Station, a medical examination was conducted upon 
AAA at the Camp [XXX].






 
 




Dr. Camarillo testified on the Medico-Legal Report and further alleged 
that there was no evident ana-genital injury, but clarified that the 
result does not exclude sexual abuse and that further investigation, 
such as careful questioning of the child is required.
[11]




On the other hand, the CA summarized the version of the defense in this manner:


For his part, accused-appellant vehemently denied the 
accusations hurled against him by the prosecution and raised the defense
 of denial. While he admitted that he knows AAA as the daughter of his 
live-in partner, CCC, he denied that he touched or molested AAA; and 
that AAA was not living with them and he never visited the latter.





Accused-appellant narrated that, in January 2013, he was in the store 
that he manages with CCC, with their three store helpers. Nevertheless, 
he admitted that AAA would go to their house on Sundays before going to 
church.



To discredit AAA's testimony, accused-appellant contended that the 
stories were merely fabricated considering that CCC's family never 
approved of him and his relationship with CCC and that they even blamed 
him for the death of their parents.



CCC's testimony corroborated accused-appellant's version of facts. 
According to CCC, it was not possible for accused-appellant to have 
committed the crime because he was always with her in their grocery 
store as he was the one in-charge of the inventory and the remittance of
 money to the bank. She admitted that her sister adopted her daughter, 
AAA, because she was not able to provide for her. Although she loves her
 daughter, she did not regain custody over her despite the fact that she
 already has the means to support her. The accusations against 
accused-appellant are merely ill-motivated because her family 
disapproved of her relationship with him.
[12]


Judgment of the RTC



After trial, the RTC found accused-appellant guilty of the crime charged. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:


WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the Court finds 
accused EDILBERTO MANUEL, JR. GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of RAPE 
defined and penalized under Article 266-A No. 1(a) of the Revised Penal 
Code, as amended by Republic Act (R.A) No. 8353 or the Anti-Rape Law of 
1997 of the Revised Penal Code. He is ordered to suffer imprisonment of 
reclusion perpetua

 and to indemnify the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 by way of civil
 indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary 
damages.


SO ORDERED.
[13]




The RTC gave credence to the testimony of AAA who positively identified 
accused-appellant as her abuser. It found the same to be 
straightforward, convincing, and consistent despite her mental 
deficiency. There was no tinge of revenge or rancor in her testimony. It
 held that the absence of any abrasions or injury on the genitalia of 
AAA is of no moment because such is not indispensable for a rape 
conviction. It refused to give weight to accused-appellant's defense of 
denial and imputation of ill motive.
[14]

 Lastly, the trial court ruled that the fact of AAA's mental's 
deficiency was well-established by competent medical evidence. 
Unperturbed, accused-appellant appealed his conviction.




Judgment of the CA



As stated, the CA affirmed the RTC decision with modifications. It 
affirmed the conviction against accused-appellant for rape and the 
corresponding penalty but modified the amounts awarded and imposed legal
 interest. The 
fallo
 reads:


WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DENIED.



The January 31, 2017, Decision rendered by Branch 36 of the Regional 
Trial Court [XXX], Laguna, in Criminal Case No. 21532-2013-C is hereby 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant Edilberto Manuel, Jr. is 
sentenced to 
reclusion perpetua
 without eligibility of parole, 
and ordered to pay AAA: (1) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) 
P75,000.00 as moral damages; and (3) P75,000.00 as exemplary damages. 
All amounts due shall earn legal interest of six percent (6%) 
per annum
 from the date of this Decision until full payment.





SO ORDERED.
[15]




The appellate court declared that it was not persuaded by 
accused-appellant's argument that the physical evidence does not support
 the charge of rape. It noted that there was no definitive statement in 
the medico-legal report that AAA could not have been subjected to sexual
 abuse. It held that the credible disclosure of AAA that 
accused-appellant raped her is the most important proof of the 
commission of the crime. It found that there is no evidence that AAA was
 moved by any improper motive. It likewise rejected accused-appellant's 
defense of denial.
[16]





Hence, this appeal.



Accused-appellant argues that the courts a 
quo
 gravely erred: (1)
 in giving credence to private complainant's testimony despite its 
failure to correspond with documentary evidence presented; and (2) in 
not considering his defense of denial. He asseverated that AAA was not 
able to detail how he had allegedly sexually abused her. All she did was
 to describe in general terms that he had inserted his penis into her 
vagina without narrating the circumstances leading to the incident. He 
highlights the fact no hymenal laceration or evident injury to AAA's 
private organ was noted in her medical examination. He stresses that 
with AAA's testimony discredited and the hatred that their family holds 
against him, his defense of denial and alibi should be considered.
[17]




Issue



Inevitably, the issue here is whether the lower courts erred in convicting accused-appellant of the crime charged.


Ruling of the Court



The appeal fails to persuade.



At the onset, it must be noted that the information charged 
accused-appellant not only with rape, as punished by Article 
266-A(l)(b), but also with the allegation that the accused-appellant 
knew of the mental retardation of complainant at the time of the 
commission of the offense. This, coupled with a review of the records 
and the Court's decision in 
People v. Castillo
,
[18]
 compels the Court to convict accused-appellant with qualified statutory rape, despite the 
sub-silencio
 treatment of both trial and appellate courts on the qualifying circumstance alleged in the information.








Accused-appellant's guilt for the generic crime of rape was proven beyond reasonable doubt.


 







Art. 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (
RPC
) provides that rape is committed:








1) 


By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:












 








a)


 Through force, threat or intimidation;


 












 








b)


 When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;


 












 








c) 


By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;


 












 








d)


When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age
 or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.
[19]
 (emphasis supplied)


 







The elements of rape under Art. 266-A of the RPC are: (1) the offender 
had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (2) such act was accomplished 
through force or intimidation; or when the victim is deprived of reason 
or otherwise unconscious; or when the victim is under twelve years of 
age.
[20]





In 
People v. Castillo
,
[21]

 the Court expressly held that "sexual intercourse with a mental 
retardate whose mental age is below 12 years old constitutes statutory 
rape,"
[22]
 
viz
.:


In the 2017 cases of 
People v. Deniega
 and 
People v. Niebres
,
 however, the Court held that sexual intercourse with a mental retardate
 whose mental age is below 12 years old constitutes statutory rape. 
These cases cite 
People v. Quintos
, which provided for the distinctions between "deprived of reason," "demented," and "mental retardation." To quote:


The term, "deprived of reason," is associated with insanity or madness.

 A person deprived of reason has mental abnormalities that affect his or
 her reasoning and perception of reality and, therefore, his or her 
capacity to resist, make decisions, and give consent.


The term "demented," refers to a person who suffers from a mental condition called dementia.

 Dementia refers to the deterioration or loss of mental functions such 
as memory, learning, speaking, and social condition, which impairs one's
 independence in everyday activities.


We are aware that the terms, "mental retardation" or "intellectual disability," had been classified under "deprived of reason." 
The
 terms, "deprived of reason" and "demented," however, should be 
differentiated from the term, "mentally retarded" or "intellectually 
disabled." An intellectually disabled person is not necessarily deprived
 of reason or demented. This court had even ruled that they may be 
credible witnesses.
 However, his or her maturity is not there 
despite the physical age. He or she is deficient in general mental 
abilities and has an impaired conceptual, social, and practical 
functioning relative to his or her age, gender, and peers. Because of 
such impairment, he or she does not meet the "socio-cultural standards 
of personal independence and social responsibility."


Thus, a person with a chronological age of 7 years and a nonnal mental 
age is as capable of making decisions and giving consent as a person 
with a chronological age of 35 and a mental age of 7. Both are 
considered incapable of giving rational consent because both are not yet
 considered to have reached the level of maturity that gives them the 
capability to make rational decisions, especially on matters involving 
sexuality. Decision-making is a function of the mind. Hence, 
a 
person's capacity to decide whether to give consent or to express 
resistance to an adult activity is determined not by his or her 
chronological age but by his or her mental age. Therefore, in 
determining whether a person is "twelve (12) years of age" under Article
 266-A(l)(d), the interpretation should be in accordance with either the
 chronological age of the child if he or she is not suffering from 
intellectual disability, or the mental age if intellectual disability is
 established.
 (emphases supplied and citations omitted)


Following these developments, it is clear that as regards rape of a mental retardate, the Court now holds that, following 
People v. Quintos
,
 when the victim is a mental retardate whose mental age is that of a 
person below 12 years old, the rape should be classified as statutory 
rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of the RPC, as amended.
[23]


 




To this end, for a successful prosecution of the crime of rape as 
punished under Art. 266-A, paragraph(l)(d), the following essential 
elements must be alleged and proven: the fact of sexual congress between
 the rapist and his victim, and the latter's mental age is that of a 
person below 12 years old.
[24]
 Both facts were proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.




Here, it was undisputedly proven that AAA, at the age of 16 years old, 
was diagnosed to have a developmental age of 5 to 5.5 years old. This 
was testified to by her doctor as well as her family members.




Further, her testimony on her experience under the hands of 
accused-appellant, whom she called "Kuya Boy" or "Charles," convinces 
this Court that accused-appellant successfully had carnal knowledge of 
AAA. During her direct examination, the public prosecutor presented AAA 
with a sketch of a male person. AAA pointed to the male genitalia and 
referred to it as "
itlog
." When confronted with the sketch of a 
female person, she properly identified the vagina and narrated that it 
was there where accused-appellant placed his "
itlog
."
[25]





The testimony of AAA is clear. Accused-appellant succeeded in having carnal knowledge of AAA when he inserted his "
itlog
"
 inside her vagina. The fact that AAA was not able to detail the 
circumstances leading to the incident is of no moment, for the element 
of rape that must be proven by her testimony is the fact of carnal 
knowledge. She testified on this score definitively, upon which the 
trial court convicted accused-appellant and the CA affirmed said 
conviction.



In an attempt to denigrate AAA's testimony, accused-appellant argues 
that her testimony was not supported by the medico-legal report which 
provided that there was no hymenal laceration or evident injury in AAA's
 private organ, internal or external.
[26]

 Suffice it to say that this Court has repeatedly held "xxx that the 
absence of physical injuries or fresh lacerations does not negate rape, 
and although medical results may not indicate physical abuse or hymenal 
lacerations, rape can still be established since medical findings or 
proof of injuries are not among the essential elements in the 
prosecution for rape."
[27]
 Besides, the medico-legal report itself expressly stated that its results do not exclude sexual abuse.
[28]








 
 






Moreover, it is a general principle of law that factual findings of the 
trial court, including its assessment as to the credibility of the 
witnesses, are not disturbed on appeal unless the trial court is 
perceived to have overlooked, misunderstood or misinterpreted certain 
facts or circumstances of weight which, if properly considered, would 
have materially affected the outcome of the case.
[29]

 This Court finds that there is no compelling reason to disturb the 
factual findings as well as their assessment of the credibility of the 
prosecution witnesses, as the same came from the straightforward 
testimony of AAA.




In the face of AAA's testimony, accused-appellant's defense of denial 
and alibi fails. There is no showing that she was impelled by any 
improper motive. As the Court previously held, "considering the mental 
retardation of AAA, [W]e find it highly improbable that she would 
fabricate the rape charge against appellant. It is likewise unlikely 
that she was instructed into accusing appellant given her limited 
intellect Due to her mental condition, only a very traumatic experience 
would leave lasting impression on her so that she would be able to 
recall it when asked."
[30]




The Court inevitably concludes that, indeed, accused-appellant had carnal knowledge with AAA.






The prosecution was also 
successful in proving the qualifying circumstance that transforms the 
offense into qualified statutory rape.


 








As regards the qualifying circumstances stated in the information, a 
review of the records compels the Court to conclude that the prosecution
 was able to prove the qualifying circumstance that would change the 
nature of the offense to qualified statutory rape.



Art. 266-B of the RPC provides that the death penalty shall also be 
imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following 
aggravating/qualifying circumstances:


x x x x






(10) 


When the offender knew the mental disability, 
emotional disorder and/or physical handicap of the offended party at the
 time of the commission of the crime.
 (emphasis supplied)








Here, it was established that accused-appellant is the live-in partner 
of the biological mother of AAA. Further, while accused-appellant denied
 that he was living in the same house as AAA, he admitted, nevertheless,
 that AAA visited their house every Sunday before going to church. To 
the mind of the Court, his relationship with AAA's biological mother, as
 well as the frequency of AAA's visits and meetings with 
accused-appellant every Sunday, is sufficient to clothe him of 
awareness, if not knowledge, of the condition of AAA.




In 
People v. Dela Paz
,
[31]

 the Court imputed knowledge of the victim's mental condition to the 
accused therein considering that accused frequented the house of the 
victim and was the drinking buddy of the victim's brother. There, the 
Court was satisfied that their interactions during those encounters 
would have informed therein accused of the mental status of the victim.




Here, it is impossible for the accused-appellant to not have known the 
mental state and condition of AAA. His intimate relationship with her 
biological mother, as well as AAA's frequent and scheduled visits every 
Sunday to his home, are sufficient proof to establish his culpability 
for the crime of qualified rape. Truly, accused-appellant cannot feign 
ignorance of the mental condition of AAA.


The Proper Penalty




Under Art. 266-B of the RPC, qualified statutory rape shall be punished by 
death
. However, due to the passage of Republic Act No. 9346, 
The Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines
, the penalty is automatically reduced to 
reclusion perpetua
. Furthermore, the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 should be qualified by the phrase "without eligibility for parole" pursuant to the Court's guidelines
[32]
 in A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC.
[33]




Lastly, following the Court's ruling in 
People v. Jugueta
,
[34]

 the Court orders accused-appellant to pay the following amounts: 
P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, 
P100,000.00 as exemplary damages; and interest imposed on the said 
amounts at the rate of six percent (6%) 
per annum
 from the date of finality of this decision until fully paid.

 In these lights, the following guidelines shall be observed in the imposition of penalties and in the use of the phrase "
without eligibility for parole
":






(1)


 In cases where the death penalty
 is not warranted, there is no need to use the phrase "without 
eligibility for parole" to qualify the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
; it is understood that convicted persons penalized with an indivisible penalty are not eligible for parole; and














(2) 


When circumstances are present warranting the
 imposition of the death penalty, but this penalty is not imposed 
because of R.A. [No.] 9346, the qualification of "
without eligibility for parole
" 
shall be used to qualify reclusion perpetua

 in order to emphasize that the accused should have been sentenced to 
suffer the death penalty had it not been for R.A. No. 9346.
