[ G.R. No. 207418, June 23, 2021 ]


ROSELLA BARLIN, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
DECISION




HERNANDO, J.:


Challenged in this petition
[1]
 are the December 6, 2012 Decision
[2]
 and June 10, 2013 Amended Decision
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 31462, which affirmed with modification the May 10, 2006 Decision
[4]

 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City, Branch 151, in 
Criminal Case No. 119540 which found Rosella Barlin (petitioner) guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt of 
Estafa
 under Article 315 (1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).


The Antecedents:



The Information
[5]
 charging petitioner with 
Estafa
 under Article 315 paragraph 1(b) of the RPC reads:


Sometime [o]n March 3 to May 8, 1999, in San Juan, Metro 
Manila, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
accused, received in trust from Ruth S. Cagayan (sic), Triumph products 
covered by various trust receipts in the amount of P74,055.00, with the 
obligation to dispose and sell the said item and thereafter remit the 
same to the complainant, but the accused once in possession of the said 
amount and far from complying with her obligation, with unfaithfulness 
and abuse of confidence and in violation of the trust reposed on her, 
with intent to gain and to defraud said Ruth S. Cagayan (sic), did then 
and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously misappropriate, misapply
 and convert to her own personal use and benefit the said amount of 
P74,055.00, without authority and knowledge of the said complainant, in 
the amount of P74,055.00, and despite demands from the complainant to 
return the said amount, said accused failed and refused to return the 
same to the loss, damage and prejudice of Ruth S. Cagayan. (sic)


Contrary to law.
[6]



Petitioner pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.


Evidence for the Prosecution:



Private complainant Ruth S. Gacayan (Gacayan) and petitioner were both 
dealers of Triumph products in San Juan, Metro Manila. After 
petitioner's store was gutted by a fire, Gacayan agreed to place orders 
of Triumph products in petitioner's behalf through Gacayan's credit 
line. Their transactions were covered by Trust Receipt Agreements 
(TRAs). The parties agreed that petitioner would either pay for the 
items or return them if unsold after 30 days from receipt thereof.
[7]



Out of the 22 TRAs presented by the prosecution, only two were signed by
 petitioner herself while the others were signed by her salespersons, 
Margie Castillo (Castillo) or Eva Varga!(Vargal).
[8]



On the other hand, Gacayan admitted that she also purchased Avon items 
from petitioner covered likewise by TRAs. The value of the Avon 
merchandise as well as the returned unsold Triumph products were 
off-setted from the amount due from petitioner.
[9]









From March 6, 1999 until December 16, 1999, petitioner religiously 
returned the unsold items to Gacayan. However, Gacayan claimed that 
petitioner failed to pay on time for the other items with a total value 
of P74,955.00. Petitioner thus issued checks to pay her obligations to 
Gacayan but the checks bounced for having been drawn against a closed 
account. Hence, Gacayan filed a criminal complaint for 
estafa
 against petitioner. During trial, Gacayan claimed that petitioner owed her P78,055.00.
[10]


Evidence for the Defense:



Petitioner was a group and franchise dealer of Avon products. She met 
Gacayan, a group dealer of Triumph products, when the former was still a
 candidate dealer. When petitioner's store was gutted by fire, she 
requested Gacayan to allow her to use her account so she could continue 
to purchase Triumph products at a discount. Gacayan agreed on the 
condition that petitioner pay the items within a month from receipt 
thereof.
[11]



Out of the 22 TRAs submitted by the prosecution, petitioner admitted to 
having received the items covered by TRAs 0081 and 0083 only as per her 
signature thereon. Petitioner also claimed that Gacayan received Avon 
products from her with a total value of P25,900.00 but this amount was 
not deducted from her payables to Gacayan. Neither did Gacayan sign any 
TRA. Petitioner insisted that she already returned all unsold products 
to Gacayan with a total value of P43,000.00. Thus, she no longer had any
 liability to Gacayan.
[12]



Finally, petitioner admitted that a criminal case for violation of Batas
 Pambansa Bilang 22 (BP 22) was filed by Gacayan against her in the 
Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Branch 57 of San Juan, Metro Manila. 
Petitioner presented a Compromise Agreement on the civil liability they 
entered into on October 16, 2002 on the BP 22 case. She claimed that she
 was in the process of paying off the compromise amount of P50,000.00.
[13]






Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:


Â 







On May 10, 2006, the RTC rendered its Decision
[14]
 convicting petitioner of 
Estafa
 defined and penalized under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the RPC.










 




The RTC found that petitioner received items from Gacayan as per the 
TRAs presented by the prosecution. Thus, petitioner could not deny 
having procured items from Gacayan. Her failure to remit the proceeds of
 the sale of the products or to return the unsold items constitutes the 
crime of 
estafa
.
[15]



Moreover, her partial cash payments and the offsetting with the products
 procured by Gacayan will not exculpate her from criminal liability for 
the crime of 
estafa
. Neither did the alleged compromise agreement
 she entered into with Gacayan before the MeTC of San Juan be used as a 
defense for prosecution for 
estafa
.
[16]



The 
fallo
 of the RTC judgment reads:
[17]


WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Rosella Barlin GUILTY 
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa defmed and penalized 
under Art. 315 par. 1 (b) of the Revised Penal Code and imposes upon her
 the indeterminate sentence of from FOUR (4) YEARS and TWO (2) MONTHS of
 
prision correccional
 as minimum to THIRTEEN (13) YEARS of 
reclusion temporal

 as maximum and to indemnify complainant Ruth S. Cagayan also known as 
Ruth S. Gacayan the sum of P74,055.00 and to pay the costs.


SO ORDERED.
[18]


Ruling of the Court of Appeals:



In its assailed Decision,
[19]
 
the CA found that petitioner guilty as charged when she disposed the 
goods covered thereby without delivering the proceeds to Gacayan. 
Section 13 of Presidential Decree No. 115 (PD 115), otherwise known as 
the 
Trust Receipts Law
, clearly provides that when the entrustee 
fails to turn over the proceeds of the sale of goods, documents or 
instruments by a trust receipt or to return the goods, documents or 
instrument if unsold or not disposed of shall be liable for the crime of
 
estafa
 under Article 315 paragraph 1(b) of the RPC.
[20]



The appellate court held that petitioner personally received in her name
 the items which were covered by the TRAs. However, despite demand, she 
denied receipt of the items except those covered by two TRAs which she 
signed herself and failed to pay in full.
[21]










 




Nonetheless, the appellate court noted that the prosecution failed to 
sufficiently prove the exact amount of petitioner's obligation since 
Gacayan submitted inconsistent computations.
[22]



The appellate court only considered the trust receipts and the amounts 
reflected therein which were duly proven by the prosecution, namely, TRA
 No. 0081,
[23]
 0083
[24]

 and the trust receipts identified by Gina Taberna (Taberna), Gacayan's 
saleslady who testified that Castillo signed TRA No. 0064,
[25]
 0065,
[26]
 0072,
[27]
 0073
[28]
 and 0077
[29]

 in behalf and with authority of petitioner. The total amount owed, 
therefore, of petitioner to Gacayan was reduced to P24,975.00.
[30]



Moreover, the appellate court ruled that the compromise agreement 
entered into by the parties before the MeTC of San Juan with respect to 
the criminal case filed by Gacayan against petitioner for the latter's 
violation of BP 22 did not novate the TRAs to a contract of loan or 
relieve Badin of her criminal liability and convert it to one merely 
civil in nature.
[31]



The dispositive portion of the appellate court's Decision reads as follows:


WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed Decision dated 
May 10, 2006 in Criminal Case No. 119540 finding accused-appellant 
ROSELLA BARLIN guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of estafa 
under Article 315(1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code is hereby AFFIRMED 
with the MODIFICATION that accused-appellant ROSELLA BARLIN is sentenced
 to suffer the indeterminate penalty of four years and two months of 
prision correccional
 as minimum to six years, eight months and 21 days of 
prision mayor

 as maximum. Accused-appellant is ORDERED to indemnify private 
complainant Ruth Gacayan in the amount of P24,975.00 as actual damages 
and to pay the costs.


SO ORDERED.
[32]



Upon petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration, the CA rendered its June 10, 2013 Amended Decision
[33]
 affirming the judgment of conviction but modifying the minimum penalty imposed, 
viz
.:


"x x x accused-appellant ROSELLA BARLIN is sentenced to 
suffer the indeterminate penalty of SIX (6) MONTHS AND ONE (1) DAY OF 
PRISION CORRECCIONAL AS MINIMUM to six years, eight months and 21 days 
of prision mayor as maximum. Accused-appellant is ORDERED to indemnify 
private complainant Ruth Gacayan in the amount of P24,975.00 as actual 
damages and to pay the costs.


SO ORDERED."
[34]


Hence, this petition.


Issues



Petitioner raises the following errors:


I


WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT THE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BARLIN AND GACAYAN ARE TRUST RECEIPT AGREEMENTS.


II


WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN CONVICTING BARLIN OF AN OFFENSE NOT SPECIFICALLY STATED IN THE INFORMATION.


III


WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN CONVICTING BARLIN OF ESTAFA
 WHICH WAS NOT PROVEN AND ESTABLISHED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
[35]


Our Ruling



All the essential elements of 
Estafa
 are present in this case.



The elements of estafa under Article 315 paragraph (1)(b) of the RPC 
are: (a) that money, goods, or other personal properties are received by
 the offender in trust, or on commission, or for administration, or 
under any other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of, or to
 return, the same; (b) that there is a misappropriation or conversion of
 such money or property by the offender or a denial of the receipt 
thereof; (c) that the misappropriation or conversion or denial is to the
 prejudice of another; and (d) that there is a demand made by the 
offended party on the offender.
[36]


First
, there is no dispute that petitioner received merchandise 
from Gacayan as evidenced by TRAs 0081 and 0083 signed and executed by 
petitioner herself. However, contrary to the ruling of the courts below,
 petitioner could not be held liable for the other TRAs as they were not
 signed by petitioner but either by Castillo or Vargal. We are not 
persuaded by Taberna's bare and uncorroborated testimony that petitioner
 authorized Castillo and Vargal to sign on her behalf.



Aside from the testimony of Taberna, no other evidence was presented by 
the prosecution to prove that Castillo or Vargal were authorized by 
petitioner to sign or to receive the goods on her behalf. The evidence 
presented by the prosecution as to the other TRAs fell short of the 
standard of moral certainty.



Hence, petitioner could not be made liable for the TRAs other than the 
ones she signed, namely, TRAs 0081 and 0083. Any doubt on petitioner's 
guilt should be considered in her favor.



As to TRAs 0081 and 0083, the documents clearly stated that petitioner 
received in trust the merchandise from Gacayan to: (a) hold the goods in
 trust; (b) dispose or sell them for cash and to receive the proceeds in
 trust; (c) turnover and remit the proceeds of the sale of goods on or 
before the due date less petitioner's commission; and (d) return the 
goods in the event of non-sale within period specified or upon demand. 
Upon default or failure of petitioner to comply with any of the terms 
and conditions, Gacayan may cancel the trust receipt and take possession
 of the goods subject of the trust or the proceeds realized therefrom.



The agreement or contract between the parties is the formal expression 
of the parties' rights, duties and obligations and is the best evidence 
of the parties' intention. Thus, when the terms of agreement have been 
reduced into writing, it is considered as containing all the terms 
agreed upon and there can be, between the parties and their 
successors-in-interest, no evidence of such terms other than the 
contents of the written agreement.
[37]



Contrary to petitioner's contention, she entered into a trust receipt 
agreement with Gacayan and not a barter or exchange. The terms of TRAs 
0081 and 0083 were clear that she received the products listed therein 
in trust for Gacayan. She obligated herself to dispose the goods and 
receive the proceeds of sale in trust for Gacayan. In case the goods 
were not sold, she must return them to Gacayan.



Although, admittedly, Gacayan testified that she likewise procured Avon 
merchandise from petitioner through the same trust receipt agreement, 
the said transactions will not negate petitioner's obligation under TRAs
 0081 and 0083. Their offsetting agreement did not modify, amend or 
novate petitioner's obligations under TRAs 0081 and 0083.


Second
, petitioner failed to turn over the proceeds of the sale 
of the products she procured from Gacayan under TRAs 0081 and 0083 upon 
the latter's demand. Petitioner even admitted that a similar case with 
respect to the same transactions were the subject matter of a criminal 
case for violation of BP 22 before the MeTC of San Juan for an amount of
 P50,000.00. She apparently attempted to pay Gacayan post-dated checks 
worth P50,000.00 which eventually bounced for having been drawn against a
 closed account. This fact alone proves petitioner's culpability that 
she misappropriated or converted the proceeds of the sale of the items 
she held in trust for Gacayan.




Third
, petitioner's misappropriation or conversion of the 
proceeds of the sale of Gacayan's products caused damage to the latter 
in the total amount of P8,275.00.
[38]

 Gacayan is deemed to have suffered damage when she parted with her 
goods and did not receive the proceeds of the sale thereof or the unsold
 items were not returned despite demand.


Lastly
, Gacayan demanded payment from petitioner under TRAs 0081 and 0083 which went unheeded.



Petitioner's contention that she was not informed of the cause of 
accusation against her in the Information fails to convince. The 
Information clearly and categorically charged her with 
Estafa
 
under Article 315 paragraph (1)(b) for violating the trust receipt 
agreements she had entered into with Gacayan. It must be stressed that a
 violation of trust receipt agreements would make the accused criminally
 liable for 
estafa
 under paragraph (1)(b) of Article 315 of the RPC as expressly provided in Section 13 of the Trust Receipts Law.



The prosecution had proved petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of 
estafa
.
 The element of damage was sufficiently established when Gacayan parted 
with her goods and failed to recover the proceeds of the sale thereof or
 the unsold items despite repeated demands. Petitioner herself admitted 
that she tried to turn over the proceeds of the sale under the TRAs 
through the issuance of post-dated checks which were however dishonored.



Petitioner even admitted before the trial court that the post-dated 
checks were issued with respect to the same transactions in this case. 
She also presented a Compromise Agreement with respect to the dishonored
 post-dated checks executed by the parties before the MeTC of San Juan.



As regards the proper penalty, Article 315 of the RPC, as amended by 
Republic Act No. 10951 (RA 10951) provides that the imposable penalty is
 
arresto mayor
 in its medium and maximum periods, which ranges 
from two (2) months and one (1) day to six (6) months when the amount of
 fraud does not exceed P40,000.00. Considering that there is no 
mitigating and aggravating circumstance present in this case, the proper
 penalty should be within the range of three (3) months and eleven (11) 
days to four (4) months and twenty (20) days. The Indeterminate Sentence
 Law is not applicable in this case since the maximum term of 
imprisonment does not exceed one year.





Thus, in view of RA 10951 and considering the amount involved, it is 
proper to impose upon the petitioner the penalty of three (3) months and
 eleven (11) days of 
arresto mayor
 in its medium and maximum periods.



In addition, petitioner is ordered to pay Gacayan the unpaid balance of 
P8,275.00 under TRAs 0081 and 0083 plus interest. In conformity with our
 ruling in 
Nacar v. Gallery Frames
,
[39]
 the sum of P8,275.00 shall earn interest at the rate of 12% 
per annum
 from the time of its judicial demand, 
i.e.
, filing of the Information on October 30, 2000 until June 30, 2013 and 6% 
per annum

 from July 1, 2013 until full payment. The prosecution presented a 
Notice of Final Demand dated February 28, 2000. However, the same does 
not prove receipt by herein petitioner. Hence, absent any proof of the 
specific date of the extrajudicial demand, the computation of the legal 
interest shall start from the filing of judicial demand or Information. 
From then, the entire amount of judgment award shall earn 6% 
per annum
 until fully paid.


WHEREFORE
, the petition is hereby 
DENIED
. The December 6, 2012 Decision and June 10, 2013 Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 31462 are hereby 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATION
.



Petitioner Rosella Barlin is:



(a) 
SENTENCED
 to suffer imprisonment of three (3) months and eleven (11) days of 
arresto mayor
 in its medium and maximum periods; and



(b) 
DIRECTED
 to 
PAY
 private complainant Ruth S. Gacayan 
the amount of P8,275.00 with interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum 
from the filing of the Information on October 30, 2000 until June 30, 
2013, and six percent (6%) per 
annum
 from July 1, 2013 until 
finality of this judgment. Thereafter, the entire amount payable shall 
bear interest of six percent (6%) per 
annum
 until full satisfaction thereof.
