PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. LEOPOLDO VIÃAS Y MANIEGO AND MARICEL TORRES Y GONZALES ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.

LEONEN, J.:


A trial court's factual findings, especially on the credibility of a 
rape survivor, are accorded great weight and respect. A conviction for 
rape may be upheld based on the survivor's testimony when it is 
credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the 
normal course of things.
  
 This Court resolves an appeal assailing the May 31, 2017 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court Decision
[2]
 finding Leopoldo ViÃ±as (ViÃ±as) and Maricel Torres (Torres) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape under Article 266-A
[3]
 of the Revised Penal Code. In an August 12, 2003 Information, ViÃ±as and Torres were charged with raping AAA, as follows:
  


 That on or about the 11
th
 day of November 2002 in the
 municipality of San Simon, province of Pampanga, Philippines and within
 the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Leopoldo  ViÃ±as y 
Maniego with lewd design, by means of force, threat and intimidation, 
did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal 
knowledge with (sic) complainant AAA, 17 years old, a minor, by then and
 there inserting his penis in her vagina which sexual assault was 
successfully perpetrated by said accused with the cooperation and help 
of accused Maricel Torres y Gonzales, who not only urged complainant to 
let her husband and accused Leopoldo  ViÃ±as y Maniego to have carnal 
knowledge with (sic) her but also pinned down the feet and separated the
 legs of the complainant to enable accused Leopoldo  ViÃ±as y Maniego to 
consummate the sexual assault against complainant AAA, against the will 
and without the consent of the latter.


 Contrary to law.
[4]




 Both ViÃ±as and Torres pleaded not guilty during arraignment, and trial on the merits ensued.
[5]
 According to the Court of Appeals, the prosecution established this version of events:
  


 On November 11, 2002, AAA, a 17-year-old cousin of Maricel 
Torres' sister[-]in[-]law BBB, visited her at her house located at 
Sucad, San Simon[,] Pampanga. Later that day, AAA, Maricel and her 
common law spouse and co-accused Leopoldo Villas together with an 
unnamed male person decided to drink liquor. They started drinking from 
five o'clock in the afternoon up to seven o'clock in the evening.


 After the drinking session, AAA then laid down to rest beside 
the children of the appellants. The appellants went inside their room 
while the unnamed male person went home. Afterwards, Leopoldo called AAA
 into their room. AAA was hesitant at first but after they repeatedly 
called her, she stood up and went to their room. When AAA was inside, 
she saw the appellants naked and using shabu. She hurriedly went out of 
the bedroom to lie down in the living room. Leopoldo followed AAA and 
tried to pull her inside the room. When she resisted, Leopoldo hit her 
causing her to collapse. Leopoldo then carried her inside the room, 
dropped her into the concrete floor and attempted to remove her clothes.
 	Since AAA was resisting and kicking him, Leopoldo asked Maricel for 
help. Maricel held AAA's hands and gagged her while Leopoldo removed 
AAA's short pants. Leopoldo told AAA to stop creating noise or else he 
would stab her. Then, while Maricel was sucking AAA's breasts, Leopoldo 
inserted his penis in AAA's vagina. Leopoldo had carnal knowledge with 
AAA until dawn. He threatened AAA not to tell anyone what they did to 
her or else he will kill her. It was only after the appellants left the 
house to go to work that AAA was able to leave. Immediately thereafter, 
AAA went to the house of her cousin BBB and recounted what happened to 
her. BBB accompanied AAA to the police authorities to report the rape 
incident. On November 13, 2002, AAA went to the Jose B. Lingad Memorial 
Regional Hospital, City of San Fernando, Pampanga, where she was 
medically examined by Dr. Luzviminda G. Guevara.

 In contrast, as summarized by the Court of Appeals, the defense's version of events unfolded this way:
  


 On November 11, 2002, Leopoldo ViÃ±as and Maricel Torres together
 with their two children were at their house. Leopoldo was cutting grass
 while Maricel was cooking.


 At around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, AAA and Maricel's sister 
CCC went to the spouses' house. The four of them chatted until 6 o'clock
 in the evening. Thereafter, AAA borrowed a bicycle from Leopoldo's 
mother and went home.


 After AAA and CCC left, Leopoldo and Maricel went to ate dinner 
and watched television. Thereafter, they slept and woke up at about 7 
o'clock in the morning of November 12, 2002. On the same day, CCC 
returned the bicycle.


 On November 13, 2002, Leopoldo learned that AAA charged him with
 the crime of rape. Three policemen brought him to the San Simon Police 
Station where he was detained. During his detention, AAA and CCC even 
brought him food. Leopoldo asked AAA why she charged him with rape. AAA 
replied "it is because of you". He understood that the charge of rape 
was a consequence of not responding to her infatuation.

 (Citations omitted)




 On December 2, 2015, the Regional Trial Court convicted ViÃ±as and 
Torres of the crime of rape. The dispositive portion of the Decision
[8]
 reads: 
  


WHEREFORE, this court hereby (a) finds accused Leopoldo Villas y 
Maniego and Maricel Torres y Gonzales guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 
the crime of simple rape through sexual intercourse, defined and 
penalized under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code; (b) sentences 
both of them to suffer the penalty of
 reclusion perpetua
; and 
(c) orders each of them to pay AAA the sum of PhP50,000.00 as civil 
indemnity, PhP50,000.00 as moral damages and PhP30,000.00 as exemplary 
damages, pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence, corresponding to said 
crime, with all such amounts to earn interest of six per centum (6%) per
 annum from the finality of this decision until full payment.
    


 SO ORDERED.
[9]




 The Regional Trial Court found that AAA's testimony proved ViÃ±as 
and Torres' guilt beyond reasonable doubt Her testimony was deemed 
convincing and free from material contradiction in accusing ViÃ±as of 
inserting his penis in her vagina and Torres of holding her down and 
sucking her nipples.
[10]
 The force, threat, and intimidation were found present when both accused overpowered her and ViÃ±as threatened to stab her.
[11]

 The trial court also accounted for AAA's minority and both accused's 
physical superiority over her in bolstering the possibility of the rape 
being consummated. It also found that contrary to the defense's claim, 
AAA had no improper motives in accusing ViÃ±as and Torres of rape.
[12]

 To the Regional Trial Court, Torres was liable alongside Villas under 
the principle of conspiracy, pursuant to Article 8 of the Revised Penal 
Code which states: 
  


 ARTICLE 8. 	Conspiracy and Proposal to Commit Felony. â 
Conspiracy and proposal to commit felony are punishable only in the 
cases in which the law specially provides a penalty therefor. 


 A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an 
agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.
 


 There is proposal when the person who has decided to commit a felony proposes its execution to some other person or persons. 




 According to the Regional Trial Court: 
  


 Here, the second paragraph of the Information alleged in general
 terms how Leopoldo had carnal knowledge with AAA by inserting his penis
 into her vagina which sexual act was successfully perpetrated by the 
said accused with the cooperation and help of Maricel who not only urged
 complainant to let her husband and accused Leopoldo ViÃ±as y Maniego to 
have carnal knowledge with her but also pinned down the feet and 
separated the legs of the complainant to enable accused Leopoldo ViÃ±as y
 Maniego to consummate the sexual assault" against AAA "against the will
 and without the consent of the latter". To this court's mind, and in 
consonance with the ruling in 
People v. Quitlong, supra
, these 
words are sufficient to allege the conspiracy of Maricel with Leopoldo 
in committing the crime of rape. Indeed, the established facts and 
circumstances of the case show that at the time AAA was raped, both 
accused clearly had (a) the same purpose and were united in its 
execution; and (b) a concurrence of wills or unity of action or purpose,
 or common and joint purpose and design. Stated differently, there is no
 doubt that both accused acted in conspiracy, as seen through their 
concerted actions in committing rape.
[13]




 The Regional Trial Court identified Torres as an indispensable 
participant in ViÃ±as's rape of AAA, and that she bore equal 
responsibility even though she did not have carnal knowledge of AAA.
[14]

 On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification the Regional
 Trial Court Decision. The dispositive portion of its May 31, 2017 
Decision reads:
  


 WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated December 2, 2015 of the Court 
a quo

 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS; the awards of civil indemnity, moral 
damages and exemplary damages are increased to P75,000.00 each; in 
addition all monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of six 
percent (6%) 
per annum 
from date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. 


 SO ORDERED.
[15]




 The Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court's finding 
that AAA was a credible witness, and that the alleged inconsistencies in
 her testimony were inconsequential to the outcome of the case. Citing 
People v. Espejon
,
[16]

 it noted that in a prosecution for rape, the material fact or 
circumstance to be considered is the occurrence of the rape, not the 
time of its commission. It added that a successful prosecution for rape 
can be based on the complainant's testimony if, as in this case, it is 
straightforward, convincing, and consistent on material matters.
[17]

 As to the defense's claim that the November 13, 2002 medical 
examination showed that the lacerations on AAA were healed, the Court of
 Appeals held that healed lacerations do not negate rape. It clarified 
that medical findings are not indispensable in a rape case.
[18]
 The Court of Appeals modified the award of damages per 
People v. Jugueta
,
[19]
 increasing the monetary awards to P75,000.00 each, with 6% interest per annum until fully paid.
[20]
 ViÃ±as and Torres filed a Notice of Appeal.
[21]

 This Court then noted the records forwarded by the Court of Appeals, 
and notified the parties that they may file their respective 
supplemental briefs if they so desired.
[22]

 Both parties manifested that they would no longer do so, and would 
instead be adopting their Briefs before the Court of Appeals.
[23]

 In their Brief, accused-appellants argue that AAA's testimony had 
irreconcilable inconsistencies. They point out her admission that she 
consumed alcohol and shabu, which would have impaired her perception, 
and her sworn statement contradicting her claim in court that she only 
escaped accused-appellants' house on November 13, 2002.
[24]

 Accused-appellants also argue that the physical evidence belied the 
claim of rape. They note how the lacerations found in AAA during the 
November 13, 2002 medical examination were healed, and not freshly 
bleeding or healing, even as the rape allegedly occurred on November 11.
[25]


In its Brief, the Office of the Solicitor General, for 
plaintiff-appellee People of the Philippines, argues that 
accused-appellants' denial could not prevail over AAA's narration of 
events and positive identification of them as her assailants. It claims 
that it proved that accused-appellant Villas had carnal knowledge of 
AAA, in which accused-appellant Torres was an indispensable participant.
 It also points out that this Court has upheld a rape conviction based 
on a complainant's testimony, despite inconclusive medical findings.
[26]
 

 The issue to be resolved here is whether or not accused-appellants 
Leopoldo ViÃ±as y Maniego and Maricel Torres y Gonzales were guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal
 Code. 
 Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code provides the elements of rape. It states: 
  


 Article 266-A. 	Rape: When And How Committed. - Rape is committed: 








1)


 
By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: 






 


 


 








a)


 
Through force, threat, or intimidation; 






 


 


 








b)


When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;






 


 


 








c)


 
By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and






 


 


 








d)


 
When the offended party is under 
twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the 
circumstances mentioned above be present.






 


 






2)


 
By any person who, under
 any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit 
an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's 
mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or 
anal orifice of another person. 










Both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals found that 
the prosecution was proved that accused-appellants committed the crime 
of rape under Article 266-A(1). In particular, the force, threat, or 
intimidation against AAA were shown in accused-appellant ViÃ±as's threats
 of bodily harm if she resisted, and accused-appellant Torres's physical
 restraint of AAA.
[27]


 The Regional Trial Court gave credence to AAA's testimony, finding her version of events clear and convincing: 
  


 In the instant case, AAA's testimony was clear, convincing and 
free from material contradiction and clearly established both the 
accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt overcoming the constitutional 
presumption of innocence. AAA was explicit, unequivocal and unswerving 
in accusing Leopoldo of inserting his penis inside her vagina while 
Maricel was holding her and sucking her nipples. Her account of how both
 accused conspired to accomplish said rape was straightforward, 
convincing and consistent on all material points, both in her 
Sinumpaang Salaysay

 subscribed on November 13, 2002 and testimony in court. She positively 
identified and pointed to the accused as her rapists, dispelling any 
doubt as to their positive identification.
[28]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Similarly, the Court of Appeals found that the defense's claims of
 inconsistencies in AAA's testimonies were insubstantial, and did not 
warrant overturning the trial court's findings on the material 
allegation of rape.
[29]
 

 This Court does not see any reason to overturn the lower courts' 
findings. A trial court's factual findings, especially on the 
credibility of the complainant, are accorded great weight and respect.
[30]
 In 
People v. Delos Reyes
:
[31]




 The rule is well-settled that when the decision hinges on the 
credibility of witnesses and their respective testimonies, the trial 
court's observations and conclusions deserve great respect and are 
accorded finality, unless the records show facts or circumstances of 
material weight and substance that the lower court overlooked, 
misunderstood or misappreciated, and which, if properly considered, 
would alter the result of the case. The Court finds no reason to deviate
 from the general rule under the proven circumstances of this case.
[32]
 (Citation omitted) 




 Accused-appellants were unable to point to any material facts or 
circumstances that either the Regional Trial Court or the Court of 
Appeals overlooked, misunderstood, or misappreciated. A conviction for 
rape may be upheld based on a complainant's testimony when it is 
credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the 
normal course of things.
[33]
 
Moreover, as the Court of Appeals correctly pointed out, medical 
examinations are not indispensable in the prosecution of a rape case.
[34]

 The finding of healed lacerations did not weaken AAA's credibility and 
disprove her claim that accused-appellants had raped her.
[35]
 

 The Regional Trial Court also correctly held that accused-appellant 
Torres was liable in the same degree as accused-appellant ViÃ±as, on the 
principle of conspiracy. In 
People v. Spouses Saban
: 
[36]




 "It is well-settled that conspiracy exists when two or more 
persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a crime and 
decide to commit it." In a case, this Court found that the husband and 
wife were guilty of rape, stating thus: 




 "The rather unique feature about this case was that a couple, 
now appellants Vicente C. Villamala and Gaudiosa Villamala, were jointly
 prosecuted for the crime of rape allegedly perpetrated on the 
complainant Eustaquia Bentulan. . . .


 . . . .


 While the two seated side by side were conversing, complainant
 heard Gaudiosa whistle, and immediately thereafter, her husband, 
appellant Vicente Villamala entered the house. No sooner was he inside 
when Gaudiosa, who was at Eustaquia's left side, placed her left arm 
around her neck and pinned the latter to the floor, the left leg of 
appellant being thrust between Eustaquia's knees. In that situation with
 Gaudiosa choking her neck, she was unable to extricate herself, being 
held fast by the bigger and the taller Gaudiosa. Vicente in turn took 
advantage of the situation and through force removed complainant's black
 skirt and panties. Such torn garments appellant Vicente Villamala threw
 aside, removed his short pants, and placed himself on top of Eustaquia.
 Thus he was able to consummate the sexual act, with Gaudiosa continuing
 to hold and pin to the floor the victim's neck and left leg. . . ."




 The circumstances of the aforecited case are on all fours with the present case. Normelita called Rolando (
Oly, maghubo ka na ng salawal
)
 and pinned the complainant's hands on the floor. She was laughing and 
laughing while her husband was perpetrating the act. "Lust is no 
respecter of time and place."
[37]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Thus, the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt 
accused-appellants' guilt for the crime of rape. The penalty of 
reclusion perpetua was correctly imposed under Article 266-B
[38]
 of the Revised Penal Code, there being no qualifying circumstances. 

 Finally, the Court of Appeals correctly modified the monetary awards in
 favor of AAA, increasing the amounts of civil indemnity, moral damages,
 and exemplary damages to P75,000.00 each, pursuant to 
People v. Jugueta
.
[39]
  Consistent with 
Nacar v. Gallery Frames
,
[40]

 the monetary awards were also correctly subjected to a 6% legal 
interest rate per annum from the date of the Decision's finality until 
full payment. 
 
WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
DISMISSED
. 
 The May 31, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 
08049 is AFFIRMED. Accused-appellants Leopoldo ViÃ±as y Maniego and 
Maricel Torres y Gonzales are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape and
 are sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
. They 
are also ordered to pay the private complainant civil indemnity, moral 
damages, and exemplary damages worth P75,000.00 each. 
 All 
damages awarded shall be subject to interest at the rate of 6% per annum
 from the finality of this Decision until full payment.
