ALLAN DE VERA Y ANTE, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




DELOS SANTOS, J.:


This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision
[2]

 dated September 27, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No.
 39723, finding petitioner Allan De Vera y Ante (petitioner) guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Violation of Section 10, 
paragraph (a) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610, otherwise known as the 
Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and 
Discrimination Act. 




The Facts




Herein petitioner was charged with the crime of Violation of Section 5, 
paragraph (b) of R.A. No. 7610 in the Information, which accusatory 
portion reads as follows:


That on or about the 7
th
 day of July 2012 in 
Quezon City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the aboveÂ­named accused, with lewd designs, did then and there 
willfully and unlawfully commit acts of lascivious conduct upon the 
person of AAA,
[3]
 a minor, 16 
years of age, by then and there fondling his penis and masturbating 
while he was beside the complainant who was then taking her examination 
at the XXX University, thereby prejudicing her psychological and 
physical development and further debasing, degrading, or demeaning the 
intrinsic worth and dignity of said AAA, as human being, to the damage 
and prejudice of said offended party.

CONTRARY TO LAW.
[4]


Upon arraignment, petitiOner pleaded not guilty to the offense 
charged. After the Pre-trial Conference, trial on the merits ensued. 


Version of the Prosecution


 AAA, a 16-year-oId. first year college student of the XXX 
University, is the private complainant in this case. AAA is both a 
Philippine and an American citizen, who was born and raised in the 
United States. The family moved back to the Philippines when AAA was in 
high school. In 2012, AAA enrolled at the XXX University as a first year
 college student.
[5]
 


AAA testified that at around 8:30a.m. of July 7, 2012, she went to 
the Filipino Department of the school to ask for her class section under
 the Special Filipino Program. Alone in the office was petitioner, who 
asked her if she wanted to take the Filipino for Foreigners Diagnostic 
Exam. AAA then agreed to take the exam since it is a requirement for the
 Special Filipino Program.
[6]
 


Petitioner then made her take the diagnostic exam inside the 
MiniÂ­Library of the Filipino Department. AAA sat on the couch and 
answered the exam on the coffee table inside the Mini-Library. 
Petitioner was standing approximately less than a meter away to the left
 of AAA and was facing a bookshelf.
[7]


 While taking the exam, AAA heard a tapping sound, which she 
initially ignored. The tapping sound sounded like clapping or like skin 
slapping against skin. When the sound got louder, she looked to where 
the sound was coming from and saw the petitioner masturbating. AAA 
testified that she saw the petitioner holding a binder on the left hand 
while his right hand was masturbating his penis.
[8]


 Afraid, AAA calmly packed her things, got up from the couch and told
 petitioner that she would.continue her exam at the reception area of 
the Filipino Department. When AAA finished the exam, she handed her 
completed exam to petitioner who has come out to the reception area from
 the Mini-Library.
[9]


 AAA immediately ran out of the office and told her classmate CCC 
what she saw in the Mini-Library. Upon the advice of CCC, AAA called her
 mother, BBB, who instructed her daughter to report the matter to the 
University Security Office. When BBB arrived at the university, she was 
told that the petitioner was already brought to the police station. BBB 
and AAA then went to the police station to file a formal complaint 
against the petitioner.
[10]




Version of the Defense


 Petitioner, on his part, denied the accusations of the private 
complainant. Petitioner claimed that on the day of the incident, he was 
assigned to arrange the books at the Tinio Mini-Library. The library is 
adjacent to the Filipino Department's reception area and was well-lit as
 it is frequented by professors, students, employees, and even visitors.
[11]


 Petitioner's supervisor Imelda Agbayani Estrelles (Estrelles), 
called petitioner's attention that the zipper of his Guess pants was 
broken. There was a vertical tear along the right sideline of the 
zipper. Since he is only required to work half-day on a Saturday and he 
lived in Antipolo, petitioner decided to pull the pants upward and his 
clothes downward as it is too impractical to go home and change clothes.
[12]


 Petitioner was assigned by Professor Carlota Francisco to administer
 a special diagnostic exam to students of the Filipino for Non-Filipino 
Speakers course.
[13]
 
Petitioner admitted that AAA decided to take the diagnostic examination 
despite having a 9:00a.m. class that day. Since he was tasked to arrange
 the books inside the Mini-Library, petitioner decided to let AAA take 
the exam therein. While AAA was taking the exam, the library door was 
open and the petitioner just stood less than one meter away from AAA 
facing the cabinet. The petitioner had one hand arranging the books on 
the shelf while the other hand was carrying books to be shelved.
[14]
 


Five minutes after, AAA asked petitioner if she could finish taking 
her exam in the reception area. Estrelles saw AAA took the exam in the 
reception area and was able to fmish it in 20 to 30 minutes. AAA then 
handed the exam papers back to petitioner.
[15]
 


A few minutes after 9:00 a.m., petitioner was surprised upon the 
arrival of the university's security officers, who arrested him based on
 the allegations of AAA that he masturbated in her presence while she 
was taking the exam. The security officers brought him to the police 
station. Thereat, petitioner's underwear was even inspected to check if 
there were some traces of discharge. The person who conducted the 
inspection found no discharge on petitioner's underwear.
[16]


 The XXX University formed an 
ad hoc
 disciplinary committee, which cleared the petitioner of the alleged masturbation incident.


Nonetheless, the private complainant pursued a criminal case against the petitioner. 


The Ruling of the RTC


The RTC found petitioner guilty of the crime of violation of Section 
5(b) of R.A. No. 7610. The RTC heId.that under Section 2(h) of the Rules
 and Regulations on Reporting and Investigation of ChildAbuse Cases, 
masturbating is considered a lascivious conduct. Considering that 
petitioner committed a lascivious act in front of the child victim who 
was only 16 years old and the latter was deemed to have been subjected 
to other sexual abuse, petitioner must be convicted of the crime 
charged. The RTC gave great weight on the positive and candid manner by 
which the child victim testified as to how petitioner masturbated in her
 presence. The RTC also held that the testimony of the child victim will
 have to prevail over the defense of denial of the petitioner.
[17]
 


The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision is hereby reproduced, thus: 


WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Allan De Vera 
y

 Ante guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Violation of 
Section 5, paragraph (b) of Republic Act No. 7610 and is hereby 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 as minimum to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
 as maximum and to pay the cost.


Accused is further ordered to pay private complainant AAA P20,000.00 
as civil indemnity, P30,000.00 as moral damages and P2,000.00 as 
exemplary damages.


SO ORDERED.
[18]




The Ruling of the CA


On appeal before the CA, petitioner interposed the following 
arguments: (a) that there was no sufficient proof that the child saw him
 actually masturbating; and (b) the prosecution failed to prove the 
elements of Section 5(b) ofR.A. No. 7610. Petitioner averred that there 
was no evidence on record to support the conclusion that he committed a 
lascivious act and that such act was performed with a child exploited in
 prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.
[19]
 


The CA partly granted petitioner's appeal and modified the RTC 
Decision. The CA heId.that while petitioner cannot be convicted under 
Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, the elements under Section 10(a) were 
duly established in this case. The CA heId.that the act of masturbating 
in the presence of the child is considered another act of abuse because 
it is prejudicial to the development of the childThe CA further opined 
that even if the Information did not specifically charge petitioner with
 child abuse under Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610, he may still be 
convicted ofthe said offense considering that the prosecution was able 
to prove all the elements of the said crime.
[20]


 The 
fallo
 of the now-assailed CA Decision reads as follows: 


WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is PARTLY GRANTED. The August 
2, 2016 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 94, Quezon City in 
Criminal Case No. Q-12-177236 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS. As 
modified, accused-appellant Allan de Veray Ante is found guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of child abuse as defined and punished under Section 
[10(a)] of Republic Act No. 7610. He is sentenced to an indeterminate 
sentence of four (4) years, nine (9) months and eleven (11) days of 
prision correccional
, as minimum, to six (6) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
,
 as maximum and is ordered to pay private complainant P10,000.00 civil 
indemnity and P20,000.00 moral damages with 6% interest [per annum] from
 the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.

SO ORDERED.
[21]


Undaunted, petitioner elevated the case before the Court 
via
 a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. 


The Issue


Whether the CA erred in convicting the petitioner of the cnme of violation of Section IO(a) of R.A. No. 7610.


The Court's Ruling


The petition is without merit.

Herein petitioner insists on his innocence and alleges that the ruling 
of the CA is not in accord with applicable law and jurisprudence. Herein
 petitioner claims that based on the account of the minor victim, the 
act of masturbation was not done with the participation of and was not 
directed at her, hence, he should be penalized with unjust vexation 
under Article 287 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) as it basically 
punishes acts which is intended to cause emotional distress.


As the factual milieu of the case reveals, petitioner was initially 
charged and convicted before the RTC of Violation of Section 5(b) of 
R.A. No. 7610. On appeal, the CA held that there was no sufficient basis
 to hoId.petitioner liable under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 
considering that the prosecution failed to prove that the minor was 
subjected to other sexual abuse. Instead, theCA convicted petitioner of 
violation of Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 considering that the act of 
intentional masturbation in the presence of the minor victim constitutes
 psychological abuse and is considered an act which debases, degrades, 
or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being.


After a judicious evaluation of the record of this case, the Court 
finds that the ruling of the CA is within the bounds of law and relevant
 jurisprudence.


 
The act of masturbation is

punishable under Section 10(a) of

R.A. No. 7610.
 


Section 10(a), Article VI of R.A. No. 7610 reads: 


(a) Any person who shall commit any other acts of child 
abuse, cruelty or exploitation or be responsible for other conditions 
prejudicial to the child s development including those covered by 
Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, as amended, but not covered 
by the Revised Penal Code, as amended, shall suffer the penalty of 
prision mayor
 in its minimum period.


From the foregoing, Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 punishes not only 
those enumerated under Article 59 of Presidential Decree No. 603, but 
also four distinct acts, namely: (a) child abuse, (b) child cruelty, (c)
 child exploitation, and (d) being responsible for conditions 
prejudicial to the child s development.
[22]

 Simply put, Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 punishes any other acts of 
child abuse not covered under other provisions of the same law.


 In relation thereto, Section 3(b) of R.A. No. 7610 defmes child abuse as: 


(b) "Child abuse" refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child which includes any of the following: 


 
 
(1) 
 
Psychological and physical abuse, neglect, cruelty, sexual abuse and emotional maltreatment; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2)
 
Any act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3)
 
Umeasonable deprivation of his basic needs for survival, such as food and shelter; [or]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(4)
 
Failure
 to immediately give medical treatment to an injured child 
nbsp;resulting in serious impairment of his growth and development or in
 his permanent incapacity or death.
 
 


Taking into account the special circumstances surrounding the case at
 bench, the act of masturbating in the presence of the minor is 
considered a lascivious conduct and constitutes psychological abuse on 
the minor victim. The act of masturbation then falls within the scope of
 R.A. No. 7610 and not the RPC.


The Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 7610 defines "lascivious conduct" as: 


The intentional touching, either directly or through 
clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or 
buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or 
mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an 
intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the 
sexual desire of any person, bestiality, 
masturbation
, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person. (Emphasis supplied)


In relation thereto, in 
Amployo v. People
,
[23]
 the Court illustrated what a "lewd" act means, 
viz
.:


The term "lewd" is commonly defined as something indecent or
 obscene; it is characterized by or intended to excite crude sexual 
desire. That an accused is entertaining a lewd or unchaste design is 
necessarily a mental process the existence of which can be inferred by 
overt acts carrying out such intention, 
i.e
., by conduct that can
 only be interpreted as lewd or lascivious. The presence or absence of 
lewd designs is inferred from the nature of the acts themselves and the 
environmental circumstances. What is or what is not lewd conduct, by its
 very nature, cannot be pigeonholed into a precise definition. As early 
as 
US. v. Gomez
 we had already lamented that â


It would be somewhat difficult to lay down any rule 
specifically establishing just what conduct makes one amenable to the 
provisions of article 439 of the Penal Code. What constitutes lewd or 
lascivious conduct must be determined from the circumstances of each 
case. It may be quite easy to determine in a particular case that 
certain acts are lewd and lascivious, and it may be extremely difficult 
in another case to say just where the line of demarcation lies between 
such conduct and the amorous advances of an ardent lover.


The Court concurs with the CA that even if the Information did not 
categorically state that petitioner is charged with Section 10(a) of 
R.A. No. 7610, he may still be convicted of the same. The failure to 
specifically indicate the aforesaid provision is not deemed fatal so as 
to violate petitioner's right to be informed of the nature and cause of 
accusation against him.
[24]
 In 
Olivarez v. Court of Appeals
,
[25]

 the Court held that despite the absence of the specific provisions of 
R.A. No. 7610, which were violated by the accused, what is determinative
 of the offense is the recital of the ultimate facts and circumstances 
in the complaint or information.
[26]
 


In the case at bench, the Information alleged sufficiently all the 
elements constituting the crime of other forms of child abuse penalized 
under Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610, namely: (a) the minority of the 
victim; and, (b) the acts constituting physical or psychological abuse 
committed by petitioner against the victim â petitioner fondled his 
penis and masturbated in the presence of the victim thereby prejudicing 
her psychological and physical development and further debasing, 
degrading and demeaning her intrinsic worth and dignity.


Thus, despite the absence of the attendance of coercion and influence
 in petitioner's act to constitute other sexual abuse, which is 
punishable under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, the CA properly ruled 
that the act is still punishable as other forms of child abuse under 
Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610.


As regards petitioner's insistence that he should be convicted with 
the crime of unjust vexation, this contention is utterly without merit. 
The purpose of the crime of unjust vexation is to cause annoyance, 
irritation, torment, distress, or disturbance to the mind of the person 
to whom it was directed.
[27]
 
However, there is overwhelming evidence on record and applicable 
jurisprudence which support the ruling of the CA that the act of 
masturbating is not just an act to vex the minor victim, but such was 
done intentionally to excite crude sexual desire on account of the minor
 victim.


Again, the law specifically classifies masturbation as a lascivious 
conduct, which basically aims to satiate the sexual desire of the doer. 
The effect of masturbation on the minor victim or the "audience" is far 
from only evoking emotions of irritation or annoyance. In this case, the
 lascivious act of masturbating caused the minor victim to suffer 
anxiety and trauma. This specie of psychological abuse is basically one 
of the acts aimed to be punished under R.A. No. 7610. While the 
petitioner asserts that the child victim may have suffered traumatic 
experience in the past which caused her to wrongly infer the acts of the
 petitioner as masturbating, such postulations are purely based on 
surmises and conjectures and cannot outweigh the direct, positive, and 
unwavering testimony of the victim that she saw the petitioner 
masturbating his penis.


As mentioned earlier, herein petitioner postulates that he should 
only be convicted of unjust vexation since the act was not done with the
 participation of or was directed at the minor victim. This position 
must fail. The fact that the act of masturbation was done by him (an 
employee of an educational institution) while the student was taking an 
examination clearly establishes that the act was intentional and 
directed towards the minor victim. Notwithstanding that the lewd act was
 done without the participation of the minor victim and even if 
petitioner was facing the bookshelf, it is worthy to emphasize that 
petitioner was fully aware that the minor victim was only an arm's 
length away from him in a small room. This leads to the conclusion that 
the act of masturbating was not merely a personal and private act of 
pleasure on the part of the petitioner nor can it be deemed to have been
 done to cause vexation or annoyance on the victim, rather it was done 
with lewd designs.


Other than the psychological abuse caused by petitioner's 
masturbation, the Court concurs with the RTC and the CA that such act is
 debasing, degrading, demeaning and is prejudicial to the child victim's
 development. To debase is to reduce the quality or purity of something.
 To degrade is to lessen the quality or character of the person. And to 
demean is to lower the character or condition of a person.
[28]

 Indeed, a student is expected to feel secure within the school premises
 and under the care of the school's faculty and employees. The feeling 
of being violated and the anxiety suffered by the minor student upon 
witnessing a school employee masturbating in her presence inside the 
school campus undoubtedly tarnished her purity, quality, character, and 
dignity. In 
Lucido v. People
,
[29]
 the Court held that the crime committed under R.A. No. 7610 is 
mala prohibita
,
 thus, the intent to debase, demean, and/or degrade is not a defining 
mark. Any lascivious conduct that results to the debasing, demeaning, 
and degrading of the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child is deemed to
 constitute the offense, as in this case.


 Petitioner likewise assails the credibility of the minor victim and 
attempts to discredit her testimonies due to some alleged 
inconsistencies. The inconsistencies relied upon by the petitioner are 
so trivial and do not affect the probative value of the testimony of the
 child victim. Herein petitioner insists that his testimony is more 
credible than that of the minor victim. Notably, the CA did not disturb 
the appreciation of the RTC of the minor victim's testimony. As a rule, 
the assessment of the trial court on the credibility and trustworthiness
 of the minor victim is generally accorded respect and even finality 
when upheld.and undisturbed by the CA.
[30]

 Unless substantial facts and pieces of evidence were patently 
overlooked, misappreciated or misunderstood, the findings offact of the 
RTC and the CA will not be disturbed by the Court.
[31]
 


At any rate, the minor victim's testimony weathered the duress of 
direct and cross-examinations and she did not waiver on her account of 
the sordid details of the act of masturbation by petitioner. To 
elucidate, an excerpt of the minor victim's testimony is hereby 
reproduced:

I saw the accused hoId.ng his 
penis and masturbating motion. A masturbating motion, I mean, hoId.ng 
his penis and moving it back and forth, that is masturbation motion.

ATTY. PANGANIBAN
 
 
 
 
Was it really possible for her to see all three (3) things, face all three (3) things at the same time?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 
 
Yes
 ma'am. I was taking my exam, it was on a coffee table, it was more of a
 couch than a chair and I was sitting down and I was taking my test. And
 as I have stated in my Affidavit, I heard a tapping motion first before
 I turn my head, I saw him masturbating.
[32]
 
 


The Court reiterates that petitioner's defenses of denial and alibi 
cannot prevail over the straightforward, detailed, and consistent 
testimony of the minor victim.
[33]
 Denial and alibis are inherently weak defenses, unless substantiated by clear and convincing evidence.
[34]
 


Herein petitioner also theorizes that the minor victim could not have
 witnessed any act of masturbation considering that she was still able 
to finish the exam and the employees at the reception area did not 
observe anything unusual on her behavior. Time and time again, the Court
 has stressed that people have different reactions to stressful or 
traumatic experiences - others may shout, faint, resist, run, some may 
openly welcome the intrusion and some may look calm on the outside, as 
in this case. However, any of these reactions do not impair or taint the
 credibility of the victim of child abuse.
[35]

 The Court concurs with the observation of the CA that the fact that the
 minor victim immediately relayed the incident to her friend and without
 delay reported the same to her mother are indications that the minor 
victim felt violated and distressed by what she witnessed.
[36]




The Penalty and Damages




Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 provides that for persons who committed other acts of child abuse, the penalty is 
prision mayor

 in its minimum period, which ranges from six (6) years and one (1) day 
to eight (8) years of imprisonment. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence 
Law, and in the absence of any mitigating and aggravating circumstances,
 the CA did not err when it imposed the penalty of four (4) years, nine 
(9) months and 11 days of 
prision correccional
, as minimum, to six (6) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
, as maximum.




As regards the award of damages, the Court hereby increases the award
 imposed by the CA to the following amounts: (1) P50,000.00 as civil 
indemnity and (2) P50,000.00 as moral damages. The Court also reinstates
 the award of exemplary damages and imposes the amount of P50,000.00 
from the P2,000.00 award by the RTC.


In 
Malto v. People
,
[37]

 the Court stressed that the purpose of R.A. No. 7610 is to afford 
children special protection against abuse, exploitation and 
discrimination. Consistent with the principles that every person who, 
contrary to law, willfully or negligently causes damage to another, 
shall indemnify the latter for the same and that every person criminally
 liable for a felony is also civilly liable.
[38]

 the Court finds that the award of civil indemnity to the child is 
proper in cases involving violation of Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610. 
As to the amount of civil indemnity to be imposed, Article 2206 of the 
Civil Code provides the minimum amount of P3,000.00 without prescribing 
for a ceiling. In 
People v. Jugueta
,
[39]

 the Court declared that even if the minimum amount cannot be changed, 
the award of civil indemnity may be validly increased and modified 
depending on the circumstances surrounding a particular case. The Court 
fmds that the award of civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 is 
reasonable under the facts obtaining in this case.


Anent the award of moral damages, there is no hard-and-fast rule in 
the determination of the fair and equitable amount considering that each
 case is governed by its unique facts. Likewise, Article 2220 does not 
fix the amount of damages to be awarded and it is discretionary upon the
 Court, depending on the mental anguish and emotional torture suffered 
by the victim.
[40]
 In line 
with prevailing jurisprudence and considering the emotional trauma the 
child victim has suffered, the Court deems it proper to increase the 
award of moral damages from P20,000.00 to P50,000.00.
[41]


 As to exemplary damages, the Court has awarded the same to set a 
public example and to serve as deterrent to elders who abuse and corrupt
 the youth.
[42]
 In this case, 
exemplary damages is awarded on account of the moral corruption and 
perversity of an employee of an educational institution, who is expected
 to be morally upright and to have the highest regards in the 
preservation and protection of the best interest of a childHence, the 
Court reinstates the award of exemplary damages and imposes the amount 
of P50,000.00 from the P2,000.00 award by the RTC.


In consonance with prevailing jurisprudence, the imposition of legal 
interest of 6% over the monetary awards from the date of finality of 
this decision until full payment thereof is upheld.


All told the Court echoes the pronouncement in 
Patulot v. People
,
[43]
 
viz
.: 


Time and again, the Court has stressed that R.A. No. 7610 is
 a measure geared towards the implementation of a national comprehensive
 program for the survival of the most vulnerable members of the 
population, the Filipino children, in keeping with the Constitutional 
mandate under Article XV, Section 3, paragraph 2, that "[t]he State 
shall defend the right of the children to assistance, including proper 
care and nutrition, and special protection from all forms of neglect, 
abuse, cruelty, exploitation, and other conditions prejudicial to their 
development." This piece of legislation supplies the inadequacies of 
existing laws treating crimes committed against children, namely, the 
RPC and Presidential Decree No. 603 or The Childand Youth Welfare Code. 
As a statute that provides for a mechanism for strong deterrence against
 the commission of child abuse and exploitation, the law has stiffer 
penalties for their commission, and a means by which child traffickers 
could easily be prosecuted and penalized. Also, the definition of child 
abuse is expanded to encompass not only those specific acts of child 
abuse under existing laws but includes also "other acts of neglect, 
abuse, cruelty or exploitation and other conditions prejudicial to the 
child s development."
