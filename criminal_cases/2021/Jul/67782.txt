CIRILO P. TIRADO, SR. AND EDNA S. CASIPLE, COMPLAINANTS, VS. YANENA D. PORTILLANO, CLERK OF COURT II, 3
RD
 MUNICIPAL CIRCUIT TRIAL COURT, BAGUMBAYAN-ESPERANZA, SULTAN KUDARAT, RESPONDENT.


D E C I S I O N




PER CURIAM:


 
Antecedents


 Complainants Cirilo P. Tirado, Sr. (Tirado) and Edna S. 
Casiple (Casiple) filed a verified complaint charging respondent Yanena 
D. Portillano, (Portillano) Clerk of Court II, 3
rd
 Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC), Bagumbayan-Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat, with misconduct.
  
 The complaint essentially alleged that Tirado was one of the accused in Criminal Case Nos. 3386 and 3387, entitled "
People of the Philippines v. Cirilo Tirado, Sr. et al.
"
 for robbery with force upon things. Casiple was Tirado's bondswoman. 
During the preliminary investigation, Casiple posted a cash bail bond of
 P40,000.00 for each case or a total of P80,000.00 for Tirado's 
temporary liberty. Casiple submitted the cash bond to Portillano, then 
Clerk of Court of the MCTC, Bagumbayan-Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat. 
Thereafter, the criminal cases were filed with the Regional Trial Court 
(RTC) and raffled to Branch 19, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat. 
 During 
the hearing, Tirado, through counsel, moved for the reduction of his 
bail bond from P40,000.00 to P20,000.00 for each case. By Order
[1]
 dated June 13, 2007 given in open court, the trial court granted the motion. 
 Thereafter, Tirado's counsel, Atty. Rutillo B. Pasok (Atty. Pasok), wrote
[2]

 respondent requesting the release of P40,000.00 from Tirado's cash 
bond. Respondent, however, refused to release the cash bond on ground 
that the order did not specifically instruct that the amount of 
P40,000.00 be released to Casiple. Consequently, Tirado filed with 
RTC-Branch 19 an 
ex-parte
 motion for issuance of an order to release P40,000.00 from his original cash bond of P80,000.00. 
 By Order
[3]

 dated June 26, 2007, the trial court granted Tirado's motion. It 
directed respondent to release the cash bond in the amount of P80,000.00
 to Atty. Heathcliff H. Leal (Atty. Leal), Clerk of Court, RTC-Branch 
19, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat. The latter, in turn, shall issue two (2) 
acknowledgment receipts for Criminal Case Nos. 3386 and 3387 in the 
amount of P20,000.00 each as cash bond for Tirado's provisional liberty.
 The remaining P40,000.00 from the original cash bond of P80,000.00 
shall be released to Casiple, the bondswoman. 
 Tirado and Casiple
 brought the Order dated June 26, 2007 to the MCTC, Bagumbayan-Esperanza
 but failed to present it to respondent after a certain Jocelyn Chiva, a
 court employee, refused to receive it because respondent was allegedly 
on leave. 
 Meantime, retired Presiding Judge Osmundo M. 
Villanueva (Judge Villanueva) of the MCTC, Bagumbayan-Esperanza 
supposedly told complainants and their lawyer Atty. Pasok that 
respondent would either execute a promissory note or pay P80,000.00 on 
or before July 30, 2007. Judge Villanueva also allegedly offered to 
advance the P20,000.00 of said amount. Tirado and Casiple rejected the 
supposed offer. They asked that the Order dated June 26, 2007 be 
strictly followed, i.e., for respondent to turn-over the cash bond of 
P80,000.00 to Atty. Leal and for the latter, in turn, to release the 
amount of P40,000.00 to Casiple while the remaining P40,000.00 be posted
 as Tirado's reduced cash bond. 
 In her Comment
[4]

 dated March 10, 2008, respondent claimed that the P80,000.00 cash bond 
had already been remitted to Atty. Leal pursuant to the Order dated June
 26, 2007 of RTC-Branch 19. She presented as proof a receipt dated July 
17, 2007. She explained that she did not immediately remit the amount 
because she had to inquire first from the auditor on the proper 
procedure for a partial refund. She further averred that the reason for 
her failure to immediately comply with the Order dated June 26, 2007 was
 because she was in Davao City attending to her sick son. Nonetheless, 
despite her leave of absence, a member of their court staff remitted the
 amount in compliance with the order. 
 
THE RTC REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION


 By Resolution,
[5]
 
dated October 21, 2009, the Court referred the administrative case to 
Judge Milanio M. Guerrero (Executive Judge Guerrero), Executive Judge of
 RTC, Tacurong City, Sultan Kudarat for investigation, report, and 
recommendation. 
 After due proceedings, Executive Judge Guerrero submitted his Investigation Report
[6]

 dated February 10, 2011, finding respondent guilty of dishonesty for 
her failure to deposit the cash bond of P80,000.00 with the court's 
authorized depositary bank. 
 Executive Judge Guerrero opined that
 respondent's failure to immediately release the amount of P80,000.00 to
 Atty. Leal, despite the court's directive, gave rise to the presumption
 that she had misappropriated it for her personal benefit. Although the 
cash bond was eventually released, albeit, more than two weeks late, 
this would not negate respondent's liability. Her delayed compliance 
demonstrates her failure to live up to the standards of competence and 
integrity expected of her as an officer of the court. 
 The 
investigation report clarified, however, that respondent was not liable 
for non-compliance with the Order dated June 13, 2007, which did not 
specifically authorize her to release the cash bond of P80,000.00 to 
Casiple. Rather, respondent's liability hinges on her failure to heed 
the Order dated June 26, 2007 to-remit the cash bond of P80.000.00 to 
Atty. Leal who, in turn, was directed to release P40,000.00 to Casiple, 
to give effect to the bail reduction granted by the court. 
 The 
ultimate penalty of dismissal is meted for the grave offense of 
dishonesty, even if committed for the first time. Despite respondent's 
resignation as clerk of court effective December 24, 2008, the Court 
has, nonetheless, held in a number of cases that resignation is not and 
should not be a convenient way to evade administrative liability. In 
lieu of dismissal, it was recommended that respondent be barred from 
accepting or holding any position in public office. 
 
THE OCA REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION


 The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) adopted the 
factual findings in the investigation report but modified the 
recommended penalty. Aside from respondent's perpetual disqualification 
from re-employment in any branch of the government, the OCA further 
recommended that all her benefits, except accrued leave credits, be 
forfeited. 
 
THE COURT'S RULING


 The Court adopts the report and recommendation of the OCA with
 modification. In addition to dishonesty, the Court also finds 
respondent guilty of grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty. 

 The duties of a clerk of court are multi-faceted. Apart from exercising
 general administrative supervision over all personnel of the court,
[7]

 a clerk of court also performs a delicate function as designated 
custodian of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties, and 
premises.
[8]
 Clerks of court 
have always been reminded of their duty to immediately deposit the 
various funds they receive to the authorized government depositories, 
for they are not supposed to keep the funds in their custody.
[9]

 The importance of proper management of court collections cannot be 
overemphasized as in fact, the Court had issued several circulars
[10]

 on the matter of handling court funds. The clerk of court is, thus, 
entrusted with the responsibility of implementing these regulations 
regarding fiduciary funds.
[11]
 Supreme Court Circular No. 13-92
[12]

 commands that all fiduciary collections "shall be deposited immediately
 by the clerk of court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an 
authorized government depositary bank." Supreme Court Circular No. 5-93,
[13]
 on the other hand, designates the Landbank of the Philippines as depositary bank for court, collections. 
 Furthermore, Section B(4) of Supreme Court Circular No. 50-95
[14]
 requires that "[a]ll 
collections from bail bonds
, rental deposits, and other fiduciary collections 
shall
 be deposited within twenty four (24) hours by the clerk of court 
concerned, upon receipt thereof, with the Land Bank of the 
Philippines[,]" in the name of the court
 as instructed in Supreme Court Circular No. 13-92.
[15]
 These circulars are mandatory in nature.
[16]

 They are plain enough to command strict compliance to promote full 
accountability for government funds and no protestation of good faith 
can override such mandatory nature.
[17]

 Here, respondent failed to immediately release Tirado's cash bond to 
Atty. Leal pursuant to the Order dated June 26, 2007. Such failure is 
considered 
prima facie
 evidence that she misappropriated the money.
[18]

 Respondent was unable to rebut this presumption. Although she tried to 
justify the delayed release of the cash bond by claiming she had a 
pending inquiry with the auditor on the procedure for a partial refund, 
respondent presented no proof to support such claim. Too, that 
respondent was in Davao City and supposedly attending to her sick son is
 not an excuse. Personal problems should never justify the incurring of 
shortages and the delay in remitting cash collections for the judiciary.
[19]

 Worse, respondent failed to fully disclose where the money was during 
this supposed inquiry. To be sure, respondent could have easily 
dispelled doubts that she misappropriated the funds by presenting the 
passbook reflecting the date or dates when she supposedly deposited and 
later withdrew the cash bond for turn over to Atty. Leal, together with 
the corresponding deposit and withdrawal slips. This respondent failed 
to do, thus, leading to the indubitable conclusion that the amount was 
never deposited with the court's depositary bank. To repeat, the fact of
 non-deposit of the fund is 
prima facie
 evidence of misappropriation which respondent failed to refute.
 In 
OCA v. Dequito
,
[20]

 the Court held that the unwarranted failure of a clerk of court to 
fulfill his responsibilities deserves administrative sanction. In 
several cases, the Court has regarded the misappropriation of judicial 
funds not only as a form of dishonesty, but also of grave misconduct
[21]
 and gross neglect of duty.
[22]


 In 
Audit Report, RTC-4, Davao del Norte
[23]
 and 
Office of the Court Administrator v. Racio, et al.
[24]
 the Court held that failure to remit court funds is tantamount to 
gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct
.
 Delayed remittance of cash collections constitutes gross neglect of 
duty because this omission deprives the court of interest that could 
have been earned if the amounts were deposited in the authorized 
depository bank. Even the restitution of the whole amount cannot erase 
her administrative liability.
[25]


 Gross neglect of duty refers to negligence characterized by 
the glaring want of care; by acting or omitting to act in a situation 
where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently, but willfully and 
intentionally; or by acting with a conscious indifference to 
consequences with respect to other persons who may be affected.
[26]

 Dishonesty is defined as a disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or 
defraud; unworthiness; lack of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or 
integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; 
disposition to defraud, deceive, or betray.
[27]

 Dishonesty is a malevolent conduct that has no place in the judiciary. 
We have repeatedly warned that dishonesty, particularly that which 
amounts to malversation of public funds, will not be countenanced. 
Otherwise, courts of justice may come to be regarded as mere havens of 
thievery and corruption.
[28]

 Misconduct, on the other hand, is a transgression of some established 
and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or 
gross negligence by the public officer. To warrant dismissal from the 
service, the misconduct must be grave, serious, important, weighty, 
momentous, and not trifling. The misconduct must imply wrongful 
intention and not a mere error of judgment and must also have a direct 
relation to and be connected with the performance of the public 
officer's official duties amounting either to maladministration or 
willful, intentional neglect, or failure to discharge the duties of the 
office. In order to differentiate gross misconduct from simple 
misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law,
 or flagrant disregard of established rule, must be manifest in the 
former.
[29]
 Rule 140 of
 the Revised Rules of Court governs the proceedings for the discipline 
of members of the judiciary as well as its officers and employees. 
Section 22 thereof classifies dishonesty and grave misconduct as grave 
offenses. On the other hand, Section 52(A)(2) of the 1999 Uniform Rules 
on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (URACCS), which has 
suppletory application to administrative cases involving officers and 
employees of the judiciary, likewise classifies gross neglect of duty as
 a serious offense. Further, Section 25(A), paragraph 1 of Rule 140 
provides that the respondent who is found guilty of a serious offense 
shall be meted the penalty of dismissal from the service, forfeiture of 
all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and 
disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office,
 including government-owned or controlled corporations. Provided, 
however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include 
accrued leave credits. 
 Here, the penalty of dismissal can no 
longer be meted on respondent in view of her resignation from the 
service. Nonetheless, the accessory penalties of cancellation of civil 
service eligibility, forfeiture of benefits, and disqualification from 
reinstatement or re-appointment to any public office subsist. Her 
accrued leave credits, however, shall not be forfeited pursuant to 
Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon v. Dionisio
[30]
 and other similar cases. 
 
ACCORDINGLY
, respondent 
YANENA D. PORTILLANO
,
 former Clerk of Court II, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, 
Bagumbayan-Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat is found guilty of dishonesty, 
gross neglect of duty, and grave misconduct. In view of her resignation 
from the service, the penalty of dismissal can no longer be imposed on 
her. Nonetheless, the accessory penalties corresponding to the penalty 
of dismissal subsist and are, thus, meted on her. Her civil service 
eligibility is 
CANCELLED
 and her retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, are 
FORFEITED
. She is 
PERPETUALLY DISQUALIFIED
 from re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations. 
 
SO ORDERED.
