SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 200333, January 21, 2015 ]


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. DOMINGO DILLA Y PAULAR, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
R E S O L U T I O N




DEL CASTILLO, J.:


Appellant Domingo Dilla y Paular was charged with the crime of murder for the death of his brother, Pepito Dilla 
y 
Paular (Pepito).  Based on the evidence presented by the prosecution, it was shown that at around 5:30 in the afternoon of July 22, 2003, at Sitio Ilaud, Himaao, Pili, Camarines Sur, Pepito was working on his farm when appellant suddenly appeared and shot the victim with a gun hitting him on his left thigh.  The victim managed to run but was overtaken by appellant who then stabbed him with a bolo.  The son of the victim, Pepito Jr., and Mary Jane Renegado (Renegado), witnessed the incident.
Appellant presented a different version.  He claimed that it was Pepito who was the aggressor.  He narrated that Pepito went to his (appellantâs) house and challenged him to a fight.  Dismissing the challenge, he went out of his house and proceeded to his farm to get his carabao but the victim pursued him.  They grappled for possession of the gun and bolo.  In the ensuing struggle, he struck the victim with a wrench.  He denied having fired the gun. He pointed to somebody allegedly wearing a hat who could have shot and stabbed Pepito.
In a Decision
[1]
 dated July 13, 2009, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pili, Camarines Sur, Branch 32, found appellant guilty of murder.  Lending credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, the trial court held that the attack on the victim was perpetrated by no other than appellant; that the attack was treacherous as the appellant suddenly appeared and shot the victim, and after having wounded him, stabbed him with a
 bolo
.  The RTC found appellantâs tale incredible and self-serving especially in view of his positive identification by the prosecution witnesses.
The dispositive portion of the trial courtâs Decision reads:
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and sentences him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua, together with its accessory penalties, condemning him to pay actual damages of P35,448.00, moral damages of P50,000.00 and P50,000.00 as indemnity for the death of Pepito Dilla; the accused is credited in full for his preventive detention should he agree in writing to abide by the rules for convicted prisoners, otherwise to 4/5 of the same; costs against the accused.
SO ORDERED.
[2]
Aggrieved, appellant appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) arguing in the main that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of the charge.  He contended that there was no direct proof showing that he actually killed the victim.
The CA, however, was not persuaded.  Thus, in its June 9, 2011 Decision,
[3]
 it affirmed with modification the findings of the RTC, 
viz
:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of the Regional  Trial Court, Branch 32, Pili, Camarines Sur, in Crim. Case No. P-3466 for Murder, convicting Domingo Dilla y Paular is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.  Accordingly, accused is hereby sentenced to suffer Reclusion Perpetua together with its accessory penalties, and is further ORDERED to pay the victimâs heirs P35,448.00, as actual damages, P50,000.00, as moral damages, and P75,000.00, as civil indemnity for the death of the victim.
SO ORDERED.
[4]
Hence, this appeal. In a Resolution
[5]
 dated April 18, 2012, we required both parties to file their Supplemental Briefs. However, both parties opted not to file the same.
[6]
  Hence, we will resolve this appeal based on the briefs submitted by the parties before the CA.
After a careful review of the records of the case, the Court finds the appeal to be lacking in merit.  The records belie appellantâs contention that there was no direct proof identifying him as the perpetrator of the crime.  The testimonies of prosecution witnesses Pepito, Jr. and Renegado established without a shadow of doubt that it was appellant who mercilessly killed his brother, Pepito.
Pepito, Jr. was categorical in his testimony that -

[7]
 
 
Pepito, Jr.âs testimony was corroborated in all material points by the testimony of Renegado.
[8]
In fine, both the RTC and the CA correctly found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and properly sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua.
  Moreover, appellant is not eligible for parole pursuant to Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9346 or the Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines. The awards of civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00 and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 are proper.  In addition, the heirs of the victim are entitled to exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00.
Anent the award of actual damages in the amount of P35,448.00, we find that only the amount of P15,000.00 was duly receipted.
[9]
  The amount of P20,448.00
[10]
 which supposedly pertained to expenses incurred during the wake was not supported by receipts but consisted only of handwritten entries.  As we held in 
People v. Villanueva
,
[11]
 âwhen actual damages proven by receipts during the trial amount to less than P25,000.00, as in this case, the award of temperate damages of P25,000.00 is justified in lieu of actual damages of a lesser amount.â  Accordingly, we grant temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00 in lieu of actual damages.  In addition, all damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum
 from date of finality of judgment until fully paid.
WHEREFORE
, the assailed June 9, 2011 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.-CR-HC. No. 04088 finding appellant Domingo Dilla 
y
 Paular guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay the heirs of Pepito Dilla 
y
 Paular the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages, is 
AFFIRMED
 with 
MODIFICATIONS
 that appellant is not eligible for parole; appellant is further ordered to pay the heirs of the victim P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P25,000.00 as temperate damages, all with interest at the rate of 6% 
per annum
 from date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.
