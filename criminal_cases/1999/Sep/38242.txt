PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RICARDO ACUNO Y BABASOL, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


A treacherous and sanguinary plot claimed the lives of three innocent persons and wounded more than a dozen others. No culprit could be identified at first. But after a couple of days, accused-appellant Ricardo Acunoâs name surfaced to end the puzzling search for the perpetrator. Indicted, he vehemently denied responsibility. His trial, however, appeared to have proved otherwise and he was thus convicted. But as he maintains his innocence, we heed the call for a review.
Records show that accused-appellant was prosecuted and subsequently convicted under an information
[1]
 for multiple murder and multiple frustrated murder filed before the Regional Trial Court, Cagayan de Oro City, Branch XIX, the accusatory portion of which reads:
âThat on or about July 31, 1993, at 4:00 oâclock in the afternoon at Capt. Vicente Roa Street, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously and with intent to kill, and with the qualifying aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation and treachery, deliberately placed inside a cement bag containing rice grains fragmentation grenade, a deadly explosive, inside a passenger jeepney loaded with several passengers, with deliberate intent to cause explosion of the same and as a consequence of which (explosion) resulted to the death of passengers Teresita Mabulay, Celso Tunglos, and Cookie Grace Dayla and serious physical injuries to passengers Richard Rabela, Ruben Cabanyas, Reynante Doria, Rey Nagac, Elsie Nagac, Charmaine Nagac, Angelina Mabunay, Oliveth Bacarrisas, Glady Abella, Arturo Domingo, Jess Nazar, Elizabeth Abratiguin, which were necessarily fatal and mortal, thus performing all the acts of execution which should have also produce (sic) the crime of Murder as a consequence, but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent of his will, that is, by the timely and able medical assistance rendered to the latter twelve (12) persons which prevented their death.â

On April 14, 1997, the trial court rendered its decision
[2]
 finding him guilty as follows
  âWHEREFORE, the court finds accused Ricardo Acuno y Babasol guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of multiple murder of Teresita Mabulay, Celso Tunglos, and Cookie Grace Gayla, and frustrated murder of Ricardo Rabela, Ruben Cabanyas, Reynante Doria, Rey Nagac, Elsie Nagac, Charmaine Nagac, Angelina Mabunay, Oliveth Bacarrisas, Glady Abella, Arturo Domingo, Jess Nazar, Elizabeth Abratiguin and Gemma Gayla, qualified by treachery, and hereby sentences [him] to suffer [the penalty of] reclusion perpetua.  
âAccused is also ordered to indemnify the heirs of Cookie Grace Gayla the sum of P50,000.00, pay them moral damages also in the sum of P50,000.00, and actual damages in the sum of P25,238.80.  
âAccused likewise is ordered to indemnify the heirs of Teresita Mabulay the sum of P50,000.00[,] moral damages in the sum of P50,000.00 and actual damages in the sum of P27,500.00.  
âHe is likewise ordered to indemnify the heirs of Celso Tunglos[,] if there are any[,] in the sum of P50,000.00.
He is also ordered to indemnify for the hospitalization and medical expenses of Gemma Gayla, Angelina Mabunay and Elizabeth Abratiguin in the respective amounts of P24,556.00, P9,372.55 and P21,846.20.
 âAccused is ordered to pay the costs and is sentenced to suffer all accessory penalties provided by law.  
âSO ORDERED.â
Evidence for the prosecution shows that at about 4:00 oâclock in the 
afternoon of July 31, 1993, Gemma Gayla and her three-year old daughter 
Cookie Grace, boarded the Pagatpat-bound passenger jeepney âCatli 2â 
which was then parked near the Yip Modern Bakery located along Capt. 
Vicente Roa Street in Cagayan de Oro City. There were already a number 
of passengers who were on board when she sat on the jeepneyâs left side 
just behind the driver. While seated, she noticed a man in military 
fatigue uniform wearing sunglasses and a multi-colored bandana on his 
head. She saw the man kneel on the right front seat of the jeepney and 
place a jute sack of rice on the seat behind him. After that, the man, 
whom this witness later identified as accused-appellant Acuno, glanced 
at her, alighted from the jeepney and walked away.
 Later, as 
additional passengers were boarding, the dispatcher urged those already 
on board to move in their seats. One passenger, Elizabeth Abratiguin, 
who sat next to the deceased Teresita âIndangâ Mabulay on the right side
 of the vehicle, requested the latter to move. Mabulay apparently 
protested because the sack was on the seat beside her, thus, prompting 
Abratiguin to call the dispatcherâs attention. The dispatcher requested 
Mabulay to remove the sack. Right after Mabulay removed the sack, there 
was a hissing sound followed by a deafening explosion. A commotion 
ensued as passengers scampered for safety. Gayla sustained a wound on 
her leg while her daughter Cookie Grace was hit by shrapnel on the right
 temple. Both of them were brought to the hospital for treatment but, 
unfortunately, Cookie Grace died the following day. The untimely death 
of her daughter caused her worry, anxiety, and wounded feelings.
 
Gayla testified further that a few days after the incident, she went to 
the âOKKâ
[3]
 office at the 
NAPOLCOM Training Center upon the invitation of police officers 
investigating the same. Inside the office, she trembled and cried when 
she saw accused-appellant whom she immediately recognized as the one who
 was wearing fatigue uniform, sunglasses and bandana and the one who put
 the jute sack inside the jeepney that caused the explosion.
Gaylaâs
 testimony was substantially corroborated by witnesses Elizabeth 
Abratiguin and Angelina Mabunay who were also on board the ill-fated 
jeepney at the time the explosion occurred.
Abratiguin confirmed 
the fact that she was seated beside the deceased Mabulay when she 
requested that the latter move after the dispatcher requested the 
passengers already on board to move in their seats in order to 
accommodate additional passengers. She remembered that she saw the jute 
sack behind the front seat and that she requested Mabulay to put the 
sack on the floor. After that, she heard Mabulay utter, âWhat is this?â 
and then an explosion followed. She was hospitalized for three days 
because of the injuries she sustained from the explosion. She likewise 
testified that she experienced nightmares and that she became scared of 
traveling from then on.
Angelina Mabunay, on the other hand, 
testified that she boarded the jeepney with Abratiguin and Mabulay 
opposite her. She claimed that she also heard the dispatcherâs request 
for Mabulay to remove the sack and that thereafter she heard a whistling
 sound and then an explosion. Although already injured on the head, she 
managed to get out of the window at which time she saw Gayla. They then 
went together to the hospital for treatment. She stated further that 
immediately prior to the incident, she saw the accused-appellant sitting
 near a table inside Yip Modern Bakery. She remembered that 
accused-appellant, who was only about four meters away from her, looked 
suspicious because he was restless and could not remain in his seat.

 Witness Noel Silabay, who was initially suspected of perpetrating the 
crime but was later released after investigation, testified that he was 
inside the Yip Modern Bakery at about the time the incident occurred. He
 recalled that accused-appellant, who was just outside the bakery, would
 stand up and walk to the right front side of the jeepney. He would then
 stay in the vehicleâs front seat, peep inside, and then return to where
 he sat. When seated, he kept on turning his head from left to right, 
looking at the direction of the bakery and then the jeepney. Just before
 the explosion, this witness saw accused-appellant approach the jeepney 
again and when the explosion occurred, he did not see him anymore.

 Felix Reyes, the jeepneyâs dispatcher, also noticed accused-appellant 
at the bakery. He observed that accused-appellant was very alert. Just 
before the explosion, he recalled seeing accused-appellant across the 
street or about ten âfathomsâ
[4]

 away from the vehicle.
Immediately after the explosion, policemen
 responded to the crime scene and found shrapnel, scattered parts of the
 jeepney, and assorted items belonging to the passengers. During the 
investigation that followed, accused-appellantâs name came up as one of 
the suspects. Since he had previous criminal records, police officers 
proceeded to his residence at Basurahan, Carmen, Cagayan de Oro City. He
 was not at home, so police officers followed him to the Carmen Market 
where he had gone according to the owner of the house. Finding him 
there, the police team invited him to go with them for investigation. 
SPO4 Ronnie Lagsa, Chief of the Homicide and Arson Section, informed 
accused-appellant of his constitutional rights. When asked by Lagsa 
about the clothes he wore at the time of the incident, accused-appellant
 readily surrendered a military fatigue uniform, sunglasses, and a 
multi-colored bandana. He was then brought to the NAPOLCOM Training 
Center for further investigation. It was there where Gayla identified 
him as the very person who placed the sack behind the front seat of the 
passenger jeepney.
Staff Sgt. Emmanuel Cawaling testified that at 
about 4:00 oâclock in the afternoon of July 31, 1993, police officers 
sought his assistance in investigating the cause of the explosion. In 
the course of the investigation, he found grenade Mark II shrapnel on 
the front seat and around the place where the sack was placed. According
 to him it was absolutely possible that the safety pin of the grenade 
had been removed and that moving the sack could have triggered its 
explosion within four to five seconds. He testified further that the 
fatal range of said grenade was five meters.
The defense, on the 
other hand, had a different version. Testifying for himself, 
accused-appellant narrated that in the morning of July 31, 1993, he went
 to Amoros, El Salvador, Misamis Oriental in the company of four other 
relatives where they harvested mangoes and gathered coconuts. At around 
3:00 oâclock in the afternoon, they left Amoros and went to Pagatpat 
terminal where the ill-fated jeepney was parked waiting for passengers 
to board. He alleged that he was left behind by his four other 
companions who boarded another jeepney. It was at this juncture that he 
stationed himself beside the jeepney where the explosion later took 
place. Contrary to the prosecution witnessesâ testimony, he claimed that
 he never left the jeepney and that he stayed near the front seat 
because it was about to depart and he really wanted to ride in front of 
said vehicle. This was why he was hit on the face, nose, ear, neck, and 
chest when the explosion occurred. Although he was hit, he was still 
conscious and was able to walk towards the Opol terminal which was 
located a block away. At the terminal, he met his uncle who inquired why
 he was bleeding and he replied that he was hit by grenade splinters. He
 was brought to the hospital for treatment but he was allowed to go home
 on the same day.
Two days after the incident, he alleged that he 
was arrested, brought to a forested area, and maltreated by police 
officers. During the investigation that followed, he disclaimed having 
perpetrated the crime and stated that he never knew who Gayla was. He 
declared further that he did not act suspiciously when he was at the 
jeepney terminal; that he did not bring anything with him when he tried 
to board the ill-fated jeepney; that he was not a soldier; that he never
 obtained any training whatsoever on how to explode a grenade, but he 
knew how a grenade looks like and that he had seen one in their place.

 Yore Miel, another defense witness, corroborated accused-appellantâs 
claim that he was at Amoros in the morning of July 31, 1993 and that 
accused-appellant was left behind upon the invitation of a certain 
âTata,â who is a bus driver.
During the pre-trial, the parties 
entered into a partial stipulation of facts: that accused-appellant was 
arraigned and had pleaded not guilty; that at around 4:00 oâclock in the
 afternoon of July 31, 1993, an explosion caused by a fragmentation 
grenade occurred inside a jeepney bearing plate number KBRâ125, plying 
the Cogon Market-Pagatpat route which was then parked along Capt. 
Vicente Roa St.; that as a consequence of the explosion, three persons 
died and thirteen others were wounded. It was further agreed that the 
victimsâ heirs shall be entitled to indemnification as well as medical 
expenses.
The sole and crucial issue to be determined in this 
appeal is whether accused-appellant is guilty of the crime for which he 
was indicted in the court 
a quo.
Accused-appellant 
maintains that he is innocent and urges this Court to absolve him of the
 crime charged as the prosecutionâs evidence failed to link him to the 
authorship of the grenade blast that killed three and wounded several 
other passengers. According to him, not one of the witnesses for the 
prosecution knew him and that their testimonies merely confirmed his 
presence at the crime scene, which fact he never disputed. He further 
avers that the witnesses could not categorically say that he was the one
 who placed the grenade inside the sack and that Gaylaâs testimony was 
actually contrived and a mere emotional outburst owing to the loss of a 
loved one. Finally, he capitalizes on the fact that after the incident, 
he still stayed in his uncleâs house in Carmen, Cagayan de Oro City 
which he alleged was an indication of his innocence, because had it been
 otherwise, he would have fled to Kalilangan, Bukidnon where he actually
 resided.
We deny the appeal.
This Court finds no cogent 
reason to reverse the finding of conviction. A judicious scrutiny of the
 records and the trial courtâs ratiocination shows beyond cavil of doubt
 that the Peopleâs evidence against accused-appellant meets the exacting
 standards of proof required to overturn the constitutional presumption 
of innocence in his favor.
As stated earlier, accused-appellant 
challenges the sufficiency of the prosecutionâs evidence linking him to 
the crime because not a single witness ever saw him place a grenade 
inside the sack. This argument fails to persuade us. Under the rules on 
evidence, accused-appellant can still be convicted even if no eyewitness
 is available to directly testify that he was seen placing a grenade 
inside a sack. All that is required is that enough circumstantial 
evidence has been established by the prosecution to prove beyond 
reasonable doubt that it was accused-appellant who committed the crime.
[5]
 To put it differently, 
accused-appellant may be convicted based on circumstantial evidence 
where the circumstances constitute an unbroken chain which leads to one 
fair and reasonable conclusion that points to him, to the exclusion of 
all others, as the guilty person.
[6]

 Indeed, circumstantial evidence may be sufficiently cogent to satisfy 
the judicial conscience, and may be as potent as direct testimony in 
tending to connect accused-appellant to the commission of the offense.
[7]
 In the case at bar, we 
find that the prosecution was able to meet the sufficient quantum of 
circumstantial evidence regarding accused-appellantâs participation in 
the offense charged. 
First,
 it was established and, in fact, 
admitted, by the accused that at about the time the blast occurred, he 
was in the locus criminis or vicinity of the crime scene. 
Second, 
the
 testimonies of Mabunay, Abratiguin, and S/Sgt. Cawaling confirmed the 
fact that the explosion was due to a fragmentation grenade as evidenced 
by the shrapnel recovered from the ill-fated vehicle and that such 
fragmentation grenade was placed inside a sack whence a hissing sound 
was heard immediately before the blast. 
Third, 
the sack would 
have been the only place where the grenade was hidden because the 
fatalities, Cookie Grace Gayla and Teresita Mabulay, were both near or 
adjacent to the sack. 
Fourth,
 Gemma Gayla positively identified
 accused-appellant both at the police station and during trial as the 
man wearing a military fatigue uniform, sunglasses and multi-colored 
bandana who placed the sack behind the front seat where deceased Mabulay
 sat and that at the time he was placing said sack, he was observed 
acting suspiciously. 
Finally,
 witness Noel Silabay described 
accused-appellant at the crime scene as acting suspiciously, always 
alert and could not remain in his seat.
 Against this string of 
circumstances duly established by the prosecutionâs evidence, all that 
accused-appellant could interpose as defense are mere denials which, 
under settled jurisprudence, could not prevail over the positive 
testimony of witnesses. Denial is intrinsically a weak defense which 
must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit 
credibility.
[8]
 Moreover, the 
mere fact that he did not leave Cagayan de Oro City does not mean that 
he is any less guilty. Flight in jurisprudence is a strong indication of
 guilt, although its converse does not necessarily imply innocence.
[9]
 While it is a rule that the 
prosecution cannot profit from the weakness of accused-appellantâs 
defense and that it must rely on the strength of its own evidence, 
nonetheless, we believe that the aforecited circumstances when taken 
together point to no other conclusion than that accused-appellant was 
indeed the perpetrator. Needless to say, proof beyond reasonable doubt 
does not mean that which produces absolute certainty ---- only moral 
certainty is required or that degree of proof which produces conviction 
in an unprejudiced mind.
