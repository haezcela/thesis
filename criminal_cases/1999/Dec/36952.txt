YNARES-SANTIAGO,
J.:


After a heated altercation with Alex Espanto and Juanito Bibat, Julio Ocumen y Saludares allegedly pulled out a knife and went berserk during a wedding celebration in the evening of October 28, 1989. In the ensuing uproar, he plunged the knife into the back of one Mary Jane Bueno who was then fourteen (14) years old and fatally stabbed one Jesus Ilasin in the stomach.
For plunging the knife at Mary Jane Buenoâs back, Julio Ocumen y Saludares was indicted for Frustrated Murder in Criminal Case No. 1774 in an Information
[1]
 alleging -
âThat on or about 9:00 oâclock in the evening of October 28, 1989, at Brgy. Aggub, Municipality of Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and by means of treachery and taking advantage of superior strength, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab the back of Mary Jane Bueno with a knife which would have caused the death of the latter, thus performing all the acts of execution which would produce Murder as a consequence but which nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrator, that is the timely medical attendance extended to the victim which prevented her death, but nevertheless resulted to her damage and prejudice.â
while for the fatal stabbing of Jesus Ilasin, he was charged with Murder in Criminal Case No. 1778 in an Information
[2]
 which avers â
âThat on or about 9:00 oâclock in the evening of October 28, 1989, at Brgy. Aggub, Municipality of Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and by means of treachery and taking advantage of superior strength, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab Jesus Ilasin with a bladed knife causing his instantaneous death, to the prejudice of his heirs.â
Upon arraignment, accused pleaded not guilty to both charges.
[3]
 The two cases were thereafter consolidated and tried on the merits.
[4]
After trial, the court 
a quo
 rendered judgment,
[5]
 the dispositive portion of which reads:
âWHEREFORE, finding accused Julio Ocumen y Saludares GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of Frustrated Murder and Murder, respectively, the said accused is hereby sentenced as follows: In Criminal Case No. 1774, accused Ocumen is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 13 years and one (1) day to 16 years of 
reclusion temporal,
 to pay the victim the sum of P25,000.00 as actual damages, P15,000.00 as moral damages, P10,000.00 as exemplary damages and to pay the costs of the suit. In Criminal Case No. 1778, Julio Ocumen y Saludares is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, to pay the heirs of Jesus Ilasin the sum of P45,000.00 as actual damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P20,000.00 as moral damages and P15,000.00 as exemplary damages and to pay the costs of the suit.
SO ORDERED.â
[6]
Dissatisfied, accused-appellant interposed this appeal ascribing a lone assignment of error which insists that â
THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR MURDER AND SENTENCING HIM TO RECLUSION PERPETUA INSPITE OF THE ABSENCE OF THAT QUANTUM OF PROOF NECESSARY TO OVERTHROW THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.
[7]
The prosecutionâs version of the incident is summed thus by the Solicitor General in the Peopleâs brief:
âIn the evening of October 28, 1989, [at] about 9:00 p.m., Camila Bueno, the prosecutionâs main witness, was entertaining guests attending her daughterâs wedding celebration inside a saloon, fronting their house, at Aggub, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. While busying herself during the affair, she was abruptly informed by her niece, Adelaida Bueno, of a commotion taking place nearby. Camila saw appellant Julio Ocumen argue heatedly with Alex Espanto and Juanito Bibat. Knowing appellant to be related to her new son-in-law, Camila approached them to pacify them. But before she could intervene, appellant charged wildly at Espanto and Bibat, who both ran away. At this point, appellant pulled out a knife and went after the duo.
[8]
Mary Jane Bueno, Camilaâs daughter, then 14 years of age, unaware of the commotion, was at the time walking towards the dancing saloon when she was suddenly stabbed from behind by appellant. Mary Jane screamed and was immediately embraced by her mother, Camila, who from a distance of about four (4) meters, because of the surprising turn of events, helplessly watched as appellant stabbed her daughter. Mary Jane had a glimpse of appellant who was running towards the mini-park outside their house.
[9]
Appellant went berserk and, chancing upon another victim, Jesus Ilasin, at the mini-park, stabbed him in the stomach near the navel.
[10]
Camilla immediately carried her wounded daughter to a tricycle and had her brought to a nearby clinic. At the clinic, they were advised to proceed to the Provincial Hospital as it did not possess adequate facilities to treat the wounds sustained by Mary Jane. Timely medical assistance in the Nueva Vizcaya Provincial Hospital saved Mary Janeâs life.
[11]
 
Ilasin, the other victim, was also rushed to the Provincial Hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival.
[12]
The Post-Mortem Report, issued by Dr. Antonio R. Labasan, reveals the following:
Stab Wound, Penetrating, 1 inch length, midclavicular line,
Subcostal margin, lacerating the body of the stomach with mesenteric blood vessel severed.
Immediate Cause of Death: Internal Hemorrhage, 2 stab wounds.
The testimonies of Dr. Labasan and of Dr. Reynaldo de la Cruz who issued the Certificate of Death
[13] 
were dispensed with during the trial, as the defense admitted the death of the victim, including its underlying cause.â
[14]
On the other hand, accused-appellant flatly denied having anything to do with the incident claiming that he was nowhere near the 
locus criminis
 at the time of its occurrence. As culled from his testimony, he was in Manila working as a carpenter and a mason in a construction company, which had an ongoing project at Ayala-Alabang, at the time and date of incident.
[15]
 He claimed that he started working with the construction firm on April 12, 1988 and came home to Villaverde, Nueva Vizcaya only on September 17, 1991.
[16]
Accused-appellantâs story was corroborated by Roger Seridon, accusedâs barriomate and childhood friend, who testified that he and accused-appellant went to Metro Manila on April 12, 1988 where they were employed as construction workers.
[17]
 They stayed there up to September 1991 boarding at the house of one Domingo Portaliza at 109 P. Burgos St., Poblacion, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila.
[18]
  Seridon declared that accused-appellant reported for work at the construction site in Ayala-Alabang on October 27 and 28, 1989
[19]
 and further stated that during the time of their employment as construction workers in Manila, they only went home during the Christmas holidays having done so at least four times.
[20]
In support of accused-appellantâs alibi, his mother, Juliana Ocumen, averred that she was in Manila on that fateful date of October 28, 1989 to deliver accused-appellantâs supply of rice so that he would not buy rice anymore.
[21]
 Like accused-appellant and Roger Seridon, she maintained that accused-appellant started working as a construction worker in Manila together with Seridon, one Tino de la Cruz and some others since April 12, 1988.
[22]
 She additionally declared that her son stopped working as a laborer in Manila on September 17, 1991.
[23]
In sum, accused-appellant assails the credibility of Camila Bueno âtestifying as the lone eyewitnessâ
[24]
 whose testimony dwelt mainly on her daughterâs case. According to him, Camila could not have witnessed either the stabbing of Jesus Ilasin or that of Alex Espanto at the mini-park because she was âso engrossed in her daughterâs condition.â
[25]
 Thus, her âinconclusiveâ
[26]
 declaration that he fatally stabbed Jesus Ilasin falls short of positive identification and is not sufficient to overthrow the constitutional presumption of innocence.
We disagree.
No rule in criminal jurisprudence is more settled than that alibi is the weakest of all defenses and should be rejected when the identity of the accused has been sufficiently and positively established by eyewitnesses to the crime.
[27]
 In other words, alibi can not prevail over the positive identification of the accused by the prosecution eyewitnesses.
[28]
 Assuming 
arguendo
 that Camila Buenoâs testimony is indeed uncorroborated, her lone testimonial declarations does not make them any less credible. This Court has consistently stated, time and again, that the testimony of a single witness, if positive and credible, will suffice to sustain a judgment of conviction even in a charge for murder.
[29]
 In the case of 
People v. Romeo Hillado
[30]
 we ruled that â
ââ¦[W]ell-settled in our jurisprudence is the principle that the testimony of a single witness, if straightforward and categorical, is sufficient to convict.
[31]
 Thus, the testimony of a lone eyewitness, if found positive and credible by the trial court, is sufficient to support a conviction especially when the testimony bears the earmarks of truth and sincerity and had been delivered spontaneously, naturally and in a straightforward manner.
[32]
 Witnesses are to be weighed, not numbered.
[33]
 Evidence is assessed in terms of quality not quantity. Therefore, it is not uncommon to reach a conclusion of guilt on the basis of the testimony of a lone witness. For although the number of witnesses may be considered a factor in the appreciation of evidence, preponderance is not necessarily with the greatest number and conviction can still be had on the basis of the credible and positive testimony of a single witness.â
[34]
Camila Bueno, whose testimony in open court was uncontradicted, positively pointed to accused-appellant as the assailant who stabbed her daughter and Jesus Ilasin on that fateful night of October 28, 1989. On direct examination, she testified as follows:

What translation do you want about that term Atty. Rupisan, so that we can discuss it.

[35]
Contrary to the claims of the defense that Camila was âinconclusiveâ in her testimonial declarations that it was accused-appellant who assaulted her daughter from behind and fatally stabbed Jesus Ilasin, she, in fact, remained steadfast and unwavering on cross-examination, despite intense grilling from defense counsel, to wit:

And when he made the rush Juanito Bibat and Alex Espanto also ran away, is that right?
A 
Yes, sir.
 
 
Q 
What direction did they go?

They ran away at the back of the house, sir.

A 
They were near the cloth curtain. (Witness is pointing to a distance of about 2 meters.)
 
 
Q 
You mean your daughter was also near the 3 persons?

About 5 meters, sir.
 
 
Q

nabagsul
â my daughter, sir.
 
 
Q 
Did your daughter meet Julio Ocumen while running under your house?
 
 
PROSECUTOR:
 
 
 
The witness is incompetent.
 
COURT:
 
 
 
According to him the daughter can be seen. Let her answer.
 
 
A 
He was the one who bumped â
nakadalapus
â my daughter, sir.
 
 
ATTY. RUPISAN:
 
 
Q 
Why (sic) did Julio Ocumen run behind your daughter swinging a weapon?
A 
Yes, sir. He was holding a knife.
 
 
Q 
So your daughter when Julio Ocumen ran(sic) towards your house were facing each other when he bumped your daughter?
A 
No, sir. They were not facing each other.
 
 
Q 
Was the back of your daughter towards Julio Ocumen while he is running to go under your house?
A 
Yes, sir.
 
 
Q 
You mean to say that when Julio Ocumen ran under your house he accidentally hit with a knife the back shoulder of your daughter?
A 
Yes, sir, he stabbed.
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
You clarify that. Was it intentional on the part of Julio Ocumen to stab your daughter or was it merely a matter of accident when he accidentally hit the back portion of the shoulder of your daughter?
 
 
A
 I do not know if he stabbed her intentionally or not, sir.
 
 
ATTY. RUPISAN:

Q 
Now about Julio Ocumen, how was he holding the weapon which you stated he was holding when he was running towards the direction of your daughter?
A
 Like this, sir. (witness demonstrating by holding the knife stretching and swinging her right hand upward).
 
 
Q 
If that is true, and your daughter had her back towards Julio Ocumen, your daughter could have been hit by the knife at the lower portion of her body and not her back shoulder, is that not correct?
A 
My daughter was still small and he swung the knife in this manner, sir.
 
 
 
(witness is swinging the knife from her side upward with her right hand.)
 
 
Q 
How old was your daughter? What is her height?
A 
Fourteen years old and her height is like this, sir. (witness pointing just above her shoulder with a height of 4 feet tall).

A
 From here up to that open window (witness pointing to the third window from the second post of the court room, a distance of 5 to 6 meters, more or less.)

A 
Yes, sir.
 
 
Q 
Did you see how Jesus Ilasin was stabbed?

Q 
Where was Jesus Ilasin stabbed?
A
 He was stabbed near the mini park leaning on the post, sir.
 
 
Q 
Post of what?
A 
The mini park, sir.
 
 
Q 
Was there a light of 
(sic)
 the mini park?
A
 Yes, sir, it was bright.
 
 
Q
 What kind of light?
A 
Fluorescent light, sir.
 
 
COURT:
 
 
Q 
Where could the light be found in relation to the position of Jesus Ilasin, was it near or was it far?
A
It was near because the light was placed in a post where Jesus Ilasin was leaning, sir.
 
 
ATTY. RUPISAN:
 
 
Q 
You mean the fluorescent lamp was attached to the post where Jesus Ilasin was leaning?
A 
No, sir because the light was connected to the shed of the dancing hall and the mini park was near the shed or the dancing hall.
 
 
Q 
The fluorescent light of the dancing hall and not the mini park, is that right?
A 
The premises could be lighted because there was no obstruction.
 
 
Q 
My question is that the fluorescent lamp is the light of the mini park, is that what you mean?
A
 Light of the shed, sir.
 
 
Q 
The shed or the dancing hall is made of coconut leaves, is that right?
A
 No, sir, it is made of canvass 
(sic).
 
 
Q 
And the fluorescent lamp is below the canvass 
(sic)
, is that right?
A
 Yes, sir.
 
 
Q
 How many fluorescent lights were there in the dancing hall?
A 
Four, sir.â
[36]
Camila Bueno, however, was not a âlone eyewitness,â contrary to the claim of accused-appellant, considering that he was identified by no less than Mary Jane Bueno herself who testified thus on direct examination:

[38]
To reiterate, accused-appellantâs defense of alibi is the weakest of all defenses for it is easy to contrive and difficult to prove.
[39]
 A positive identification of the accused made by an eyewitness prevails over such a defense.
[40]
 In this case, not one but two (2) eyewitnesses identified accused-appellant as the assailant of the victims. Furthermore, accused-apellantâs alibi, though corroborated, dovetails too neatly to deserve credence. It becomes even less plausible when it is invoked and sought to be crafted mainly by the accused himself and his immediate relatives. 
[41]
 Indeed -
ââ¦[w]e have consistently ruled that where an accusedâs alibi can only be confirmed by his relatives, his denial of culpability deserves scant consideration, especially in the face of affirmative testimonies of credible prosecution witnesses as to his presence in the crime scene.â
[42]
All told, an overall scrutiny of the records of this case leads us to no other conclusion but the correctness of the trial courtâs findings that accused-appellant committed the acts imputed to him. What remains to be determined is whether the elements of the crimes charged justify accused-appellantâs conviction for the said offenses.
While we agree that accused-appellant assaulted the victims we, nonetheless, are unable to agree with the trial court that the crimes committed by accused-appellant were murder and frustrated murder. The charges in Criminal Cases Nos. 1774 and 1778 alleged treachery as a qualifying circumstance. There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.
[43]
 Two elements are, therefore, necessary, namely: 1.] that the malefactor employed means of execution that affords the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and 2.] the said means of execution was deliberately or consciously adopted.
[44]
We find no treachery in both cases. An altercation preceded the stabbing incidents. The time between the altercation and the stabbing was not significant as to create a break in the series of events. In fact, immediately after the argument with Alex Espanto and Juanito Bibat, accused-appellant pulled out a knife and immediately rushed at the two who fled. The records clearly show that the two victims unfortunately happened to be in the path of accused as he pursued the fleeing Espanto and Bibat. That both victims were unarmed and defenseless does not by itself make the attack treacherous. Treachery can not be presumed. Indeed â
ââ¦ Deeply ingrained in our jurisprudence is the rule that where no particulars are known as to the manner in which the aggression commenced and how the act which resulted in the death of the victim unfolded, we cannot surmise from the circumstances that the accused perpetrated the killing with treachery.
[45]
 Treachery cannot be presumed, it must be proved as clearly and as convincingly as the killing itself.
[46]
 Any doubt as to the existence of treachery must be resolved in favor of the accused.â
[47]
With the absence of 
alevosia
, accused-appellant can only be convicted of homicide for the death of Jesus Ilasin. In the same manner, he can only be convicted of frustrated homicide for stabbing Mary Jane Bueno considering that the wound inflicted which punctured the right lung, lacerated the liver and transverse colon, was life-threatening.
[48]
The penalty for homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code is 
reclusion temporal
 while the penalty for frustrated homicide pursuant to Article 50 of the same Code is 
prision mayor
. In the computation of the proper penalties to be imposed, it needs be determined whether or not modifying circumstances attended the commission of the offenses.
With regard to Criminal Case No. 1778 taking advantage of superior strength has been alleged together with 
alevosia
. To take advantage of superior strength means to use 
purposely excessive
 force out of proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked.
[49]
 There has been no showing in this case that accused-appellant purposely employed superior strength to consummate his nefarious deed, hence, it can not be appreciated as a generic aggravating circumstance against him.
With the absence of any modifying circumstance, the penalty shall be imposed in the medium period. Since accused-appellant is entitled to the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, he should be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty whose minimum shall be within the range of 
prision mayor
, the penalty next lower in degree to that provided in Article 249, and whose maximum shall be within the range of 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period for the homicide charge. Taken in the light of the prevailing facts of the case, the Court deems it proper to impose upon the accused-appellant an indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
 as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of reclusion temporal as maximum, with all the accessory penalties prescribed by law.
[50]
Abuse of superior strength must, however, be appreciated in Criminal Case No. 1774. An attack made by a man with a deadly weapon upon an unarmed and defenseless woman constitutes the circumstance of abuse of that superiority which his sex and weapon used in the act afforded him, and from which the woman was unable to defend herself.
[51]
 Thus, this circumstance was appreciated in a case where the accused attacked and killed an unarmed four (4) feet, eleven (11) inch girl.
[52]
There being one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance, the penalty shall be imposed in its maximum period.
[53]
 Considering that the penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed by law for a consummated felony shall be imposed upon principals of a frustrated felony
[54]
 is prision mayor which ranges from six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years, the minimum of the imposable penalty, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, shall be taken from prision correccional, which has a range of six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years.
Taking into consideration the manner and circumstances in which the crime was committed as well as the gravity of the offense, which are factors to be considered in the determination of the imposable penaltyâs minimum term,
[55]
 the court deems it proper to impose upon accused-appellant an indeterminate prison term ranging from six (6) years of prision correccional, as minimum, to twelve (12) years of prision mayor, as maximum likewise with all the accessory prescribed by law.
The civil indemnity of P50,000.00 awarded by the trial court is sustained as this is in accord with prevailing jurisprudence.
[56]
 However, for lack of sufficient evidence, the awards of moral and exemplary damages have to be deleted.
[57]
WHEREFORE, with the following modifications that:
1.] The penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. 1774 is hereby reduced from 
reclusion temporal
 to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) years of 
prision correccional
, as minimum, to twelve (12) years of 
prision mayor
, as maximum.
2.] The penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. 1778 is hereby reduced from 
reclusion perpetua
 to an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum.
3.] The awards of moral and exemplary damages made in both cases are set aside.
The appealed Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Nueva Vizcaya, Branch 27 (Bayombong) in Criminal Cases Nos. 1774 and 1778 is AFFIRMED in all other respects.
