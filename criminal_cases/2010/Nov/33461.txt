SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 179487, November 15, 2010 ]


ROMEO ILISAN Y PIABOL, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




NACHURA, J.:


This is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the August 23, 2007 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 29937, which affirmed with modification the June 14, 2005 decision
[2]
 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 81, finding petitioner Romeo Ilisan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of homicide.
The RTC and the CA similarly arrived at the following factual findings:
On February 3, 2002, a baptismal celebration was held at the residence of Ricky Silva in Barangay Nagkaisang Nayon, Novaliches, Quezon City. Among those who attended were petitioner and one Joey Gaton (Gaton). They belonged to different groups of guests.
[3]
While Gaton and petitioner were having a drinking spree with their respective groups, one of petitioner's companions apparently got irked by the way Gaton looked at him. This prompted petitioner and his companions to maul Gaton. A melee then ensued; in the course of which, petitioner shot Gaton at the abdomen, causing the latter's instantaneous death.
[4]
 The gun used by petitioner was a .45 caliber pistol.
On February 7, 2002, an Information for murder was filed against petitioner with the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 81, 
viz.
:
That on or about 3
rd
 day of February, 2002, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously with intent to kill, and with treacheryÂ  and evident premeditation and with use of superior strength assault, attack and employ personal violence upon the person of one JOEY GATON Y GARALDE, by then and there shooting him with a gun hitting him on his trunk, thereby inflicting upon him serious and grave wounds which were the direct and immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of JOEY GATON Y GARALDE.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
[5]
When arraigned on March 18, 2002, petitioner pleaded not guilty to the offense charged.
[6]
Evidence for the prosecution consisted mainly of the testimonies of Gabriel Gaton, the victim's brother, Marlon Dellamas, and Edgardo Dag-um, both neighbors of the victim, who all positively identified petitioner as the gunman. Gabriel Gaton was summoned to the place of the incident while his brother was being mauled; Marlon Dellamas went to the scene of the incident to look for his brother Jojo; and Edgardo Dag-um was at the place where the mauling and shooting transpired.
In his defense, petitioner and his witnesses, Jomarie Ilisan and Jaime Escasinas, petitioner's brother and cousin, respectively, claimed that another guest, Chito Partisala, a jail guard in Bicutan, was the assailant. The defense also presented Engineer Leonard Jabonillo, Forensic Chemist of the Central Police District Crime Laboratory, who testified that petitioner tested negative for gunpowder residue when paraffin tests were conducted on him a day after the incident.
In its June 14, 2005 decision, the RTC accorded more weight to the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses over the declarations of the defense. There being no adequate proof that treachery and evident premeditation qualified the killing of Gaton, the RTC convicted petitioner of homicide, 
viz
.:
IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING
, the Court finds accused ROMEO ILISAN y PIABOL guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Homicide punishable under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. Applying the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law and there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the accused is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment for a term ranging from eight years and one day of 
prision mayor
 as minimum to fourteen years and eight months of 
reclusion temporal
 as maximum, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amounts of P75,000.00 as actual damages, P50,000.00 for the death of the victim and P50,000.00 as moral damages.
The period during which said accused was under detention should be deducted from the service of his sentence. Let a mittimus order be issued for service of sentence.
[7]
On appeal to the CA, petitioner questioned the credibility of the prosecution witnesses who allegedly harbored ill motive against him because they were either related to the victim or to one of the participants in the commotion. Petitioner also argued that the negative results of the paraffin residue test conducted on him strongly indicate his innocence.
[8]
In a Decision dated August 23, 2007, the CA affirmed the RTC's finding of guilt, but modified the amount of actual damages awarded and the maximum period of the penalty imposed by adding one (1) more day thereto, 
viz
.:
WHEREFORE
, the trial court's Decision dated June 14, 2005 is affirmed, subject to the modification of the maximum period of the indeterminate sentence to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal medium, and the reduction of the award of actual damages to P58,520.00.
[9]
Hence, the present petition wherein petitioner reiterates the issues he raised before the CA.
We deny the petition.
The Court generally defers to the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of witness and their testimonies, for it is in a better position to decide questions of credibility, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their attitude and deportment during trial.
[10]
 In the absence of any clear showing that the trial court overlooked or misconstrued cogent facts and circumstances which would alter a conviction, we are doctrinally bound by the trial court's assessment of the credibility of witnesses.
[11]
 The application of this rule becomes even more stringent when such findings are sustained by the appellate court,
[12]
 as in the present case.
We see no misappreciation of facts committed by the courts 
a quo
, which were uniform in their reliance on the prosecution's version. Both were correct in concluding that the identity of petitioner and his actual shooting of Gaton were established beyond moral certainty through the testimonies of three (3) witnesses, namely: (i) Gabriel Gaton, who was summoned to the place of the incident while his brother Gaton was being mauled; (ii) Marlon Dellamas, who went to the scene of the incident to look for his brother; and (iii) Edgardo Dag-um, who was in the vicinity when the shooting transpired. Their ensuing testimonies are notable:

About two (2) meters away sir.
 
 
 
Q: 
 
What kind of firearm did this Romeo Ilisan use in shooting Joey Gaton?
 
 
 
A: 
 
.45, sir.
[15]
 
 
The fact that Gabriel Gaton is the victim's brother does not impair his credibility as a witness. Relationship by itself does not give rise to a presumption of bias or ulterior motive, nor does it 
ipso facto
 diminish the credibility or tarnish the testimony of a witness. On the contrary, a witness' relationship to a victim of a crime would even make his or her testimony more credible as it would be unnatural for a relative who is interested in vindicating the crime to accuse somebody other than the culprit. The natural interest of witnesses, who are relatives of the victim, in securing the conviction of the guilty would actually deter them from implicating persons other than the true culprits.
[16]
There is likewise no indication that Marlon Dellamas and Edgardo Dag-um were improperly motivated when they testified against petitioner. As aptly observed by the Office of the Solicitor General in its Comment,
[17]
 aside from the prosecution witnesses' relationship with the other participants in the fight, petitioner failed to show any other basis for the ill motive he imputes against them. As a rule, absent any evidence showing any reason or motive for prosecution witnesses to perjure, the logical conclusion is that no such improper motive exists, and their testimonies are thus worthy of full faith and credit.
[18]
Petitioner's reliance on the negative results of the paraffin test conducted on him the day after the fateful event must fail. Our ruling in 
People v. Manalo,
[19]
Â  is 
apropos: 
[E]ven if he were subjected to a paraffin test and the same yields a negative finding, it cannot be definitely concluded that he had not fired a gun as it is possible for one to fire a gun and yet be negative for the presence of nitrates as when the hands are washed before the test. The Court has even recognized the great possibility that there will be no paraffin traces on the hand if, as in the instant case, the bullet was fired from a .45 Caliber pistol.
Indeed, paraffin tests, in general, have been rendered inconclusive by this Court. Scientific experts concur in the view that the paraffin test has proved extremely unreliable. It can only establish the presence or absence of nitrates or nitrites on the hand; still, the test alone cannot determine whether the source of the nitrates or nitrites was the discharge of a firearm. The presence of nitrates should be taken only as an indication of a possibility or even of a probability but not of infallibility that a person has fired a gun.
[20]
 Conversely, the absence of gunpowder nitrates on petitioner's hands, the day after the incident, does not conclusively establish that he did not fire a gun; neither are the negative results yielded by the paraffin test an insurmountable proof of his innocence.
The courts 
a quo
 also correctly rejected the version of the defense as a mere afterthought intended to exculpate petitioner, 
viz.
:
If it is true that they saw Chito Partisala sh[o]ot Joey, why they did not tell the policeman who arrived at the crime scene immediately that Partisala was the gunman. Why did Jomarie wait until somebody pointed to the accused as the gunman before he told them that it [was] Partisala who shot the victim.
[21]
Thus, the positive, clear, and categorical testimonies of the three eyewitnesses to the crime deserve full merit in both probative weight and credibility over the negative results of the paraffin test conducted on petitioner and his witnesses' anomalous claims.
We now go to the penalty imposed. Homicide is punishable by 
reclusion temporal.
[22]
 There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstance proven in the case at bar, the penalty should be applied in its medium period of fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months.
[23]
Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum penalty will be selected from the above range, with the minimum penalty being selected from the range of the penalty one degree lower than 
reclusion temporal
, which is 
prision mayor
 (six 
[6]
 years and one 
[1]
 day to twelve (12) years).Hence, the indeterminate sentence of eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum, imposed by the RTC, and affirmed with modification by the CA, is correct.
The civil indemnity and moral damages awarded by the RTC and the CA were also in order and consistent with current jurisprudence.
Civil indemnity is mandatory and granted to the heirs of the victim without need of proof other than the commission of the crime.
[24]
 Under prevailing jurisprudence,
 
the award of P50,000.00 to the heirs of the victim as civil indemnity is proper.
[25]
Moral damages must also be awarded because these are mandatory in cases of homicide, without need of allegation and proof other than the death of the victim.
[26]
 The award of P50,000.00 as moral damages
[27]
 is correct.
We must, however, modify the actual damages awarded by the CA. Actual damages pertain to the actual expenses incurred by the victim's heirs in relation to his death, 
i.e
., burial and funeral expenses. To justify an award therefor, it is necessary for a party to produce competent proof or the best evidence obtainable, such as receipts.
[28]
 In this case, the actual expenses incurred for the wake and burial of the victim were duly shown by receipts marked as Exhibits "K," "L," "M," and "M-1"
[29]
 in the aggregate amount of P88,520.00. But the CA awarded only P58,520.00, which, after a perusal of the records, appears to have been caused by the non-inclusion of Exhibit "L," a receipt for P30,000.00 paid by the victim's wife to La Funeraria Novaliches for the deceased's autopsy and embalming treatment, and use of mortuary equipment for the interment. Having convincingly proved the nature of the expense in the amount of P30,000.00 in Exhibit "L," it is only right to increase the actual damages awarded to the victim's heirs to P88,520.00.
WHEREFORE
, premises considered, the petition is hereby 
DENIED
. The August 23, 2007 Decision of the Court of Appeals is 
AFFIRMED
 with modification that the award of actual damages is increased to P88,520.00.
