PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. FERDINAND T. BALUNTONG,  APPELLANT. 
D E C I S I O N




CARPIO MORALES, J.:


Ferdinand T. Baluntong (appellant) appeals from the August 13, 2007 Decision
[1]
 of the Court of Appeals to which the Court had earlier referred the present case for intermediate review following 
People v. Mateo
.
[2]
In its challenged Decision, the appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction by the Regional Trial Court of Roxas, Oriental Mindoro, Branch 43, of 
Double Murder with Frustrated Murder
, following his indictment for such offense in an Information reading:
That on or about the 31
st
 day of July 1998, at about 10:30 in the evening at Barangay Danggay, Municipality of Roxas, Province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did, then and there, with malice aforethought and with deliberate intent to kill, 
set on fire, the house of Celerina Solangon, causing the complete destruction of the said house and the death of Celerina Solangon and Alvin Savarez, and inflicting serious physical injuries on Josua (sic) Savarez
, thereby performing all the acts of execution which would produce the crime of murder as a consequance (sic) but which, nevertheless do not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrator.

Gathered from the records of the case is the following version of the prosecution:
At around 10:30 p.m. of July 31, 1998, while then 12-year old Jovelyn Santos (Jovelyn) was sleeping in the house of her grandmother Celerina Solangon (Celerina) at Barangay Dangay, Roxas, Oriental Mindoro, she was awakened by heat emanating from the walls of the house. She thus roused her cousin Dorecyll and together they went out of the house.
Jovelyn saw appellant putting dry hay (
dayami
) around the house near the terrace where the fire started, but appellant ran away when he saw her and Dorecyll.
Appellant's neighbor, Felicitas Sarzona (Felicitas), also saw appellant near Celerina's house after it caught fire, following which, appellant fled on seeing Jovelyn and Dorecyll stepping out of the house, as other neighbors repaired to the scene to help contain the flames.  Felicitas also saw Celerina, who was at a neighbor's house before the fire started, enter the burning house and resurface with her grandsons Alvin and Joshua.
Celerina and Alvin sustained third degree burns which led to their death.  Joshua sustained second degree burns.
Upon the other hand, appellant, denying the charge, invoked alibi, claiming that he, on his mother Rosalinda's request, went to Caloocan City on July 15, 1998 (16 days before the incident) and stayed there until February 1999.  Rosalinda corroborated appellant's alibi.
By Decision of February 28, 2003, the trial court found appellant guilty as charged, disposing as follows:
WHEREFORE
, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:
(a) The court finds accused Ferdinand Baluntong 
GUILTY 
beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of Double Murder with Frustrated Murder punishable under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act 7659 in relation to Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code and is hereby sentenced to suffer the supreme penalty of 
DEATH
 to be executed in accordance with the existing law;
x x x x
(c)  Accused Ferdinand Baluntong is also ordered 
to pay the 
heirs of Celerina 
Suba Solangon
 the sum of 
P50,000.00 as compensatory damages
 and the 
heirs of 
Elvin 
[
sic
] Savariz
 the following:  (I) the sum of 
P50,000.00 as compensatory damages
 (II) the sum of P16,500.00 as actual damages; and (III) the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages.
SO ORDERED.

In affirming the trial court's conviction of appellant, the appellate court brushed aside appellant's claim that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  The appellate court, however, 
modified 
the trial court's decision by 
reducing 
the penalty to 
reclusion perpetua
 
in light of the passage of Republic Act No. 9346,
[5]
 and by 
additionally
 
awarding 
exemplary damages
 to the heirs of the victims (Celerina and Alvin), and 
temperate damages
 to Joshua representing his "hospitalization and recuperation."  Thus the appellate court disposed:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the February 28, 2003 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Roxas, Oriental Mindoro, Branch 43, is 
MODIFIED 
as follows:
Accused-appellant FERDINAND BALUNTONG y TALAGA is found 
GUILTY 
beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of Double Murder with Frustrated Murder and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.
Accused-appellant is 
further required to pay the heirs of the victims
 the amount of P25,000.00 as 
exemplary damages 
and the amount of P25,000.00 as 
temperate damages for the hospitalization and recuperation of Joshua Savariz
.
In all other respects, the February 28, 2003 Decision of the regional trial court is hereby 
AFFIRMED
.
[6]
 (italics and emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied) 
In his Brief, appellant raises doubt on prosecution witness Felicitas' claim that she saw appellant fleeing away from the burning house, it being then 10:30 p.m. and, therefore, dark.  He raises doubt too on Jovelyn's claim that she saw appellant, given her failure to ask him to stop putting dried hay around the house if indeed her claim were true.
After combing through the records of the case, the Court finds that the trial court, as well as the appellate court, did not err in finding that appellant was the malefactor.
There should be no doubt on prosecution witnesses Felicitas' and Jovelyn's positive identification of their neighbor-herein appellant as the person they saw during the burning of the house, given, among other things, the illumination generated by the fire. Consider the following testimonies of Felicitas and Jovelyn:
FELICITAS:
Q: Which portion of the house was on fire when you saw Balentong (sic) for the first time?
A: The fire was at the rear portion going up, sir.
Q: How 
far was Balentong (sic) from that burning portion of the house?
A: He was just infront (sic) of the house, sir.
Q: How far from the burning portion of the house?
A: 
About two (2) meters away, sir.
Q: The two (2) meters from the front portion or two (2) meters from the burning portion?
A: About two (2) meters, sir.
Q: From the burning portion?
A: Yes, sir.
[7]
  (underscoring supplied)
JOVELYN:
Q: 
How big was the fire
 when according to you, you saw the back of this Ferdinand Balontong (sic)?
A: 
It is already considerable size
, Your Honor.
Q: What effect has this fire in the illumination in that vicinity, regarding visibility of that vicinity?
A: 
The surrounding was illuminated by that fire
, Your Honor.

  (underscoring supplied)
Appellant's alibi must thus fail.
In determining the offense committed by appellant, 
People v. Malngan
[9]
 
teaches:
[I]n cases where both burning and death occur, in order to determine what crime/crimes was/were perpetrated - whether arson, murder or arson and homicide/murder, it is 
de rigueur
 to ascertain the main objective of the malefactor: (a) if the 
main objective is the burning 
of the building or edifice, but death results by reason or on the occasion of arson, the crime is simply 
arson
, and the resulting homicide is absorbed; (b) if, on the other hand, the 
main objective is to kill 
a particular person who may be in a building or edifice, when fire is resorted to as the means to accomplish such goal the crime committed is 
murder
 only; lastly, (c) if the 
objective is, likewise,
 
to kill 
a particular person, and in fact the offender has already done so, but fire is resorted to as a means to cover up the killing, then there are two separate and distinct crimes committed - 
homicide/murder and arson
. (emphasis and underscoring partly in the original; emphasis partly supplied)
Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1613, "
Amending the Law on 
Arson,"  reads:
Section 3.  Other Cases of Arson. Ã¢ââ¬ The penalty of 
Reclusion Temporal to Reclusion Perpetua
 shall be imposed if the property burned is any of the following:
x x x x
2.  Any inhabited house or dwelling;
The Court finds that there is no showing that appellant's main objective was to kill Celerina and her housemates and that the fire was resorted to as the means to accomplish the goal.
In her Affidavit executed on August 11, 1998,
[10]
 Felicitas stated that what she knew is that Celerina wanted appellant, who was renting a house near Celerina's, to move out.
How Felicitas acquired such "knowledge" was not probed into, however, despite the fact that she was cross-examined thereon.
[11]
Absent any concrete basis then to hold that the house was set on fire to kill the occupants, appellant cannot be held liable for double murder with frustrated murder.  This is especially true with respect to the death of Celerina, for even assuming 
arguendo
 that appellant wanted to kill her to get even with her in light of her alleged desire to drive him out of the neighboring house, Celerina was outside  the house at the time it was set on fire. She merely entered the burning house to save her grandsons.
While the above-quoted Information charged appellant with "Double Murder with Frustrated Murder," appellant may be convicted of Arson. For the only difference between a charge for Murder under Article 248 (3) of the Revised Penal Code and one for Arson under the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 3 (2) of P.D. No. 1613, lies in the intent in pursuing the act.
As reflected above, as it was not shown that the main motive was to kill the occupants of the house, 
the crime would only be arson
, the homicide being a mere consequence thereof, hence, absorbed by arson.
[12]
When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information and that proved, and the offense charged is included or necessarily includes the offense proved, conviction shall be for the offense proved which is included in the offense charged, or the offense charged which is included in the offense proved.
[13]
Under Section 5 of P.D. 1613, the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua 
to death is imposed when death results.  In the light of the passage of Republic Act No. 9346,
[14]
 the penalty should be 
reclusion perpetua.
A word on the damages awarded.
The appellate court affirmed the award of compensatory damages to the heirs of Celerina.  But entitlement thereto was not proven.
The appellate court likewise affirmed the award of compensatory damages, actual damages, and moral damages to the heirs of Alvin.  Compensatory damages and actual damages are the same, however.
[15]
  Since the trial court awarded the duly proven actual damages of P16,500.00 representing burial expenses, the award of compensatory damages of P50,000.00 does not lie.  It is gathered from the evidence, however, that Alvin was hospitalized for 
five days
,
[16]
 hence, an award of P8,500.00 as temperate damages for the purpose would be reasonable.
As for the award to Alvin of moral damages, the records do not yield any basis therefor.
More. The appellate court awarded exemplary damages "to the heirs of the victims," clearly referring to the deceased Celerina and Alvin.  Absent proof of the presence of any aggravating circumstances, however, the award does not lie.
[17]
When death occurs due to a crime, the grant of civil indemnity requires no proof other than the death of the victim. The heirs of Celerina are thus entitled to an award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity 
ex delicto
.
[18]
  And so are Alvin's.
The appellate court's award of temperate damages of P25,000.00 to Joshua is in order.
WHEREFORE, 
the assailed Court of Appeals Decision of August 13, 2007 is 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
, and a 
NEW
 one is rendered as follows:
Appellant, Ferdinand T. Baluntong, is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Simple Arson under Sec. 3(2) of P.D. No. 1613 and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 with no eligibility for parole.
Appellant is ORDERED to pay the amount of  P50,000.00 to the heirs of Celerina Solangon, and the same amount to the heirs of Alvin Savariz, representing civil indemnity.
Appellant is likewise ORDERED to pay the amount of P16,500.00 to the heirs of Alvin as actual damages for burial expenses, and P8,500.00 as temperate damages for hospitalization expenses.
Appellant is further ORDERED to pay P25,000.00 as temperate damages to the heirs of Celerina.
Finally, appellant is ORDERED to pay P25,000.00 as temperate damages to Joshua Savariz.
SO ORDERED.

reclusion perpetua
 or life imprisonment and allowed intermediate review by the Court of Appeals before such cases are elevated to the Supreme Court.
