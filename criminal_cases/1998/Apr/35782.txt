FLORENTINO C. BAGUNAS,
COMPLAINANT, VS. ACTG. JUDGE CONCORDIO L. FABILLAR, RESPONDENT.

D E C I S I O N




PUNO, J.:


Before us is a
verified complaint filed by Florentino C. Bagunas, dated February 27, 1997
charging Acting Judge Concordio L. Fabillar
[1]
 with
Gross Ignorance of the Law and Grave Abuse of Discretion in finding probable
cause in Criminal Case No. 1238 entitled "People of the Philippines v.
Florentino Bagunas @ "Tinong" for Illegal Possession of Firearms.


On May 17, 1995,
a demand letter was sent by SPO2 Aquilino A. Fabillar of the Giporlos Municipal
Police Station, Eastern Samar to complainant Bagunas, to wit:


"S i r:


This has reference with (sic) your
signed Memorandum Receipt dated 07 October 1989 in connection with your
borrowed caliber .38 (Smith & Wesson) revolver during your term as
Municipal Mayor of Giporlos, Eastern Samar.


As accountable officer of this Station, we have your
(sic) honor to request your cooperation to turn-over to this office the
aforecited firearm for it is very much needed for accounting of firearm
nationwide.


In relation above, may we request to hear your side
within seventy two (72) hours upon receipt thereof.


Your utmost cooperation on this matter is highly
appreciated.  I am (sic)


Very truly yours,


(Sgd.) AQUILINO A. FABILLAR


  SPO2  PNP 


Chief Invest/Supply NCPO."
[2]


In a letter
dated June 7, 1995, Bagunas informed SPO2 Fabillar that the firearm had already
been returned, viz.:


"x x x


"S i r:


In connection with your request for
turn-over of the .38 Caliber Revolver (Smith & Wesson) personally owned by
Col. Alzate, the then Provincial Commander of Eastern Samar, which revolver he
lent me for my protection during my term as the Mayor of Giporlos and for which
a memorandum receipt was caused to be prepared by Col. Alzate in your office, I
have the honor to inform you that said revolver have (sic) already been taken
from my possession sometimes (sic) in the year 1989 or 1990 by two (2)
Confidants (sic) of Col. Alzate, one of whom was (sic) a relative of said Col.
Alzate, who came to me one afternoon at about 4:30 P. M. and who alleged (sic)
that they were ordered by Col. Alzate to get the same revolver from me.  I was asking a receipt from said soldiers,
but because they were in a hurry to proceed to Lawaan for another mission, so
they only promised me to give me a receipt upon their return from Lawaan for
they might be nighted (sic).  Due to my
confidence and trust of the other person who was (sic) said to be the relative of
Col. Alzate and because Col. Alzate was my friend, I gave said revolver to
them, with my expectation and hope that they will give me the receipt for such
revolver upon their return from Lawaan, but until the following day, said two
soldiers did not pass anymore by me (sic) in Giporlos.


So, I went to the office of the
Chief of Police in Giporlos, informed Rafael Valdemoro, who was then the Chief
of Police that time (sic) about the matter and requested him to make the
incident that took place appear in his police blotter.
[3]


x x x


For your information, said Col.
Alzate was the sole property owner of said revolver and not the Municipal
Government of Giporlos nor of the Provincial Government of Eastern Samar or of
the National Government, which information about said firearm was narrated to
me by said Col. Alzate before he lend me such arm, and so, you will not be
accountable for such property which was not turned to you for responsibility
and/or accountability.


x x x.


Very truly yours, 


(Sgd.) Florentino C. Bagunas."
[4]


In spite of said
explanation, a complaint signed by SPO2 Sofronio Barsania, the Acting Chief of
Police of Giporlos Municipal Police Station, was filed on July 31, 1995
charging Bagunas with illegal possession of firearm, to wit:


"That sometimes (sic) on
October 7, 1989, the accused FLORENTINO C. BAGUNAS @ `Tinong', a resident of
Brgy. No. 2, Poblacion Giporlos, Eastern Samar, a former Municipal Mayor of
Giporlos, Eastern Samar, within the preliminary jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court the abovenamed accused failed to returned (sic) his receipted short
firearm Smith and Wesson .38 caliber revolver bearing serial number C14647 from
the office of Giporlos police station in spite of the verbal and written demand
letter made by SPO2 Aquilino A. Fabillar PNP the supply NCPO of the said
station to returned (sic) the said firearm, did there and then the (sic)
willfully, unlawfully and criminally kept in his possession and control of the
said firearm without proper documents and functional (sic) in Violation (sic)
of PD 1866 (ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF FIREARM)."
[5]
 


On August 1,
1995, respondent judge Concordio Fabillar, conducted a preliminary
investigation during which Atty. Francisco Mirales, counsel of Bagunas,
manifested that his client has not received a subpoena and copies of the
affidavits of complainant's witnesses.  Respondent judge explained that he was just conducting the "first
phase" of the preliminary investigation, hence Bagunas was not yet
entitled to a subpoena as well as to copies of the affidavits.  According to respondent judge, the first
phase of the investigation is intended to determine whether the complaint is
meritorious and it is only after finding such merit will the court issue a
subpoena.  Although Atty. Mirales informed
the respondent judge that a preliminary investigation has only one stage, he
deferred to judge Fabillar's decision to continue with the so-called
"first phase" of the preliminary investigation.
[6]
 Thus, the
investigation proceeded, with respondent judge commenting:


"x x x.


"COURT:


Now, go back to my first impression
of the case, I was asking the Chief of Police if there is a way where we can
avoid this case.  To make it simplier
(sic), to settle in this case without asking concurrence delima (sic).  Be it remembered that the respondent in this
case is an Ex-mayor of the municipality of Giporlos, a friend of the presiding
judge and he is a relative.  It is not
easy to endure the rigors of setting the case where one is friend of the
court.  I hope I can share with this
period (sic) to some people whom you know well, but that is the game (sic) the
wish be grant (sic) and according to the Supreme Court it is mandated that we
should follow the law (sic)."
[7]


After the
so-called "first phase" of the investigation, where complainant's
witnesses were simply asked whether they prepared their respective affidavits,
respondent judge issued an order, to wit:


"Pursuant to paragraph (a) of
Section 3, Rule 112 of the New Rules of Court, the court scrutinized the
complaint as well as the supporting affidavits and documents.  It is found that the complaint as supported
by the affidavits and other documents is impressed with merits.


It is therefore ordered that copies
of the complaint and supporting affidavits be furnish (sic) the respondent
Florentino C. Bagunas requiring him to file his counter affidavit within a
period of ten (10) days from receipt thereof, if he so desire, after which this
case will be set for the final phase of the preliminary investigation which
date must take place on August 14, 1995 at 8:30 o'clock in the morning. x x
x." (Underscoring supplied)
[8]


On August 9, 1995, Bagunas, through
counsel, filed his counter-affidavit and the affidavits of his witnesses.  He also filed an Urgent Motion for
Inhibition and for the Forwarding of the Case to the Provincial Prosecutor for
preliminary investigation.
[9]


In an Order
dated August 9, 1995, respondent judge denied the Motion holding that although
he is a "friend" of Bagunas and a distant relative of prosecution
witness SPO2 Aquilino Fabillar, under Rule 137, he is not mandatorily required
to inhibit himself from conducting the preliminary investigation.  He also denied Bagunas' request to forward
the case to the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor.
[10]


On August 14,
1995, respondent judge issued an order
[11]
 finding
probable cause against Bagunas.  He
forthwith issued a warrant of arrest against Bagunas.


On August 24,
1995, Bagunas, through counsel, filed a Motion to Transmit Resolution/Records
of the Case to the Provincial Prosecutor, alleging that:


"x x x.


"2.
      
On August 17, 1995 at about 10:00 A.M., undersigned counsel
requested the Clerk of Court of this Court to show him the records of this case
for him to examine all other evidence submitted by the complainant, if any, pursuant
to paragraph (b) of P.D. No. 911, in relation to paragraph (b), Section 3, Rule
112 of the New Rules on Criminal Procedure, but he was informed that the case
folder was brought home by the Honorable Presiding Judge, hence the same could
not be available for examination;


3.
       
Respondent
is intending to file a motion for reinvestigation of this Case before the
Provincial Prosecutor's Office, however, the resolution together with the
entire records of this case is, up to this time, with the custody of this
court;


x x x."
[12]


Respondent Judge
denied said Motion stating:


"x x x.


"It must be emphasized that
the records of this case can only be elevated to the Office of the Provincial
Prosecutor for his proper action, upon the termination of the preliminary investigation
in conformity with the provisions of the aforesaid section thus cited.  But the preliminary investigation could not
be terminated because although the court has already made clarificatory
questions upon some witnesses of the case during which the accused deliberately
failed to appear despite due notice, pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph
(e) of Section (sic) of the same rule, and thus has found the existence of a
probable cause, pursuant to the mandate of Paragraph (b) of Section 6, also of the
same rule, the accused has not been placed under the jurisdiction of this court
and remains at large despite the issuance of a warrant for his apprehension,
the Preliminary Investigation therefore cannot be terminated and as a
consequence thereof, cannot be elevated to the proper forum of competency.


The court is ready with its
resolution of the result of the Preliminary Investigation, but as above
intimated, it cannot elevate the records hereof as the accused had not been
arrest (sic) nor surrendered to the court or any proper authority. Before then,
the preliminary investigation cannot be terminated and the records cannot be
elevated.


SO ORDERED."
[13]


On September 8,
1995, Bagunas, through counsel, filed a Motion for Reinvestigation with the
Department of Justice where he raised the following grounds:


"1.
      
THE PRESIDING JUDGE HAS COMMITTED GRAVE AND PATENT ABUSE OF
DISCRETION IN NOT FORWARDING THE RECORDS OF THIS CASE TO THE PROVINCIAL PROSECUTOR
AND IN THE PRECIPITATE ISSUANCE OF THE WARRANT OF ARREST AGAINST THE
RESPONDENT.


2.
       
THE
INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY THE PRESIDING JUDGE WAS TAINTED WITH PATENT AND
GROSS IRREGULARITIES AND NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 37 OF BATAS PAMBANSA
BILANG 129 IN RELATION TO PD 911, AS SUBSTANTIALLY REPRODUCED IN SECTION 3,
RULE 112 OF THE NEW RULES ON CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.


3.
       
THE FACTS ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT DO NOT
CONSTITUTE THE OFFENSE OF ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF FIREARM."
[14]


On September 15,
1995, Bagunas surrendered to respondent judge and posted a bond for his
temporary release.


On September 18,
1995, respondent judge issued another Resolution finding probable cause exists
to continue with Criminal Case No. 1238 for Illegal Possession of Firearm
against Bagunas.
[15]


On January 15,
1996, Asst. Provincial Prosecutor Fred O. Japzon, submitted his Reinvestigation
Report finding that:


"x x x there is no gun
recovered from the respondent, the charge is based only on a Memorandum
Receipt, the corpus delicti, the gun, which is the body of the crime was not
recovered, so, there is no prima facie case in this instant case that can
prosper in filing an information.


That the return of the gun in
question a short firearm Smith and Wesson .38 caliber revolver to the two (2) soldiers
on September 12, 1990 was witnessed by PO3 Victor Leona, PNP, Giporlos and
Sangguniang Bayan Juan Albutra, and was recorded in the next day September 13,
1990 in the Police Blotter, Annex "A", for the defense  which the undersigned believed to be truthful
and recorded properly.


That the demand letter of SPO3
Aquilino Fabillar dated May 17, 1995 happened only after there was a case filed
against prosecution witness Angel Dacuno in the Ombudsman Visayas, and five (5)
years after it was recorded in the police blotter on September 13, 1990, that
the said firearm was already returned to two (2) soldiers sent by Lt. Col.
Alzate.


That the prosecution witness Angel
C. Dacuno, is bias (sic) because he became a witness to this case after
respondent filed against him nine (9) criminal cases in the Ombudsman,
prosecution witness Maximo C. Fabillar is also biased because he is a relative
of the incumbent Mayor Rodito Fabillar, who had an election protest filed
against him by respondent.


C o n c l u s i o n-


In view
of the foregoing reasons, let this case of Illegal Possession of Firearms
against Florentino C. Bagunas, alias Tinong, be dismissed, as it is hereby
ordered DISMISSED."
[16]


Hence, this
administrative complaint before us where Bagunas alleges that respondent judge
exhibited gross ignorance of the law and abused his discretion when he: (1)
refused to inhibit himself from conducting the preliminary investigation; (2)
failed to dismiss Criminal Case No. 1238 for lack of probable cause; and (3)
precipitately issued a warrant of arrest.


After
investigation, the Court Administrator found that the complaint is meritorious.


We agree.


Under Par. 1,
Sec. 1, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court, a judge or judicial officer shall be
mandatorily disqualified to sit in any case in which:


(a)
      
he,
or his wife or child, is pecuniarily interested as heir, legatee, creditor or
otherwise;


(b)
      
he
is related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or
affinity, or to counsel within the fourth degree, computed according to the
rules of civil law;


(c)
      
he
has been executor, administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel;


(d)
      
he
has presided in any inferior court when his ruling or decision is the subject
of review, without the written consent of all parties in interest, signed by
them and entered upon the record.


Paragraph two of
Section 1, Rule 137, provides for the rule on voluntary inhibition and states:
"(a) judge may, in the exercise of his sound discretion, disqualify
himself from sitting in a case, for just or valid reasons other than those
mentioned above."


In the case at
bar, respondent Judge is not mandatorily disqualified from conducting the
preliminary investigation of the complainant.  His relationship to prosecution witness SPO2 Aquilino Fabillar does not
fall under the scope of the prohibition mandated by the Rules of Court.
[17]


The next issue
is whether the respondent judge should have voluntarily inhibited himself.  Whether or not a judge should voluntarily
inhibit himself is addressed to his sound discretion.  The operative word is sound for the soundness of his discretion
can be passed upon by this Court.  Where
the exercise of his discretion is characterized by grave abuse, this Court will
not sit still and let the error remain uncorrected.  In the case at bar, we find the respondent judge gravely abused
his discretion when he decided to proceed with the preliminary investigation of
the complainant knowing fully well that his impartiality was impaired.


The records show
that respondent judge's partiality manifested itself when he found the
existence of probable cause in Criminal Case No. 1238 despite paltry evidence
presented by the prosecution.  Acting
Chief of Police Barsania filed the complaint for illegal possession on the basis
of a mere Memorandum Receipt signed by Bagunas on October 7, 1989 and executed
by Pfc. Aquilino Fabillar, then supply officer of Giporlos Police Station.
[18]
 It is highly suspicious why the
police would try to recover said firearm after a span of five (5) years.  Indeed, SPO2 Aquilino Fabillar, who wrote
the demand letter, is privy to the issuance of said firearm to Bagunas.  For his part, Bagunas did not deny that he
received the subject firearm.  However,
he asserts that he had returned it and the return was recorded in the police
blotter.
[19]
 To corroborate Bagunas' assertion,
Juan Albutra and PO3 Victor L. Leona stated in their respective
counter-affidavits that on September 12, 1990, they witnessed then Mayor
Bagunas surrendering the subject firearm to two (2) soldiers who were sent by
Col. Alzate.
[20]
 And we take it against the
prosecuting police officers that they did not present Col. Alzate, who is in
the best position to shed light on the whereabouts of the firearm he issued to
Bagunas.


More telling
against the respondent judge is the series of procedural blunders he committed
to the prejudice of the respondent, viz.:  (1)  in insisting that there are
two stages to a preliminary investigation; (2) in holding that he could not
conclude the preliminary examination and transmit the records to the provincial
prosecutor for appropriate action without acquiring jurisdiction over the
person of Bagunas through his arrest; and (3) in ruling that there was
necessity to issue a warrant of arrest.


In Sangguniang
Bayan of Batac, Ilocos Norte v. Judge Efren Albano,
[21]
 we have explained that under our
new rules of procedure, preliminary investigation has only one stage, viz.:


"(u)nder the old rules, the
preliminary investigation conducted by a municipal judge had two stages: (1)
the preliminary examination stage during which the investigating judge
determines whether there is reasonable ground to believe that an offense has
been committed and the accused is probably guilty thereof, so that a warrant of
arrest may be issued and the accused held for trial; and (2) the preliminary
investigation proper where the complaint or information is read to the accused
after his arrest and he is informed of the substance of the evidence adduced
against him, after which he is allowed to present evidence in his favor if he
so desires.  Presidential Decree 911,
upon which the present rule is based, removed the preliminary examination stage
and integrated it into the preliminary investigation proper.  Now, the proceedings consist only of one
stage."


Nor should the
respondent judge wait for the arrest of the accused before elevating the
records of the case to the provincial prosecutor.  Section 5, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court is crystal clear on the
matter, viz.:


"Sec. 5.  Duty of investigating judge. -- Within ten
(10) days after the conclusion of the preliminary investigation, the
investigating judge shall transmit to the provincial or city fiscal, for
appropriate action, the resolution of the case, stating briefly the findings of
facts and the law supporting his action, together with the entire records of
the case, which shall include:  (a) the
warrant, if the arrest is by virtue of a warrant; (b) the affidavits and other
supporting evidence of the parties; (c) the undertaking or bail of the accused;
(d)  the order of release of the accused
and the cancellation of his bail bond, if the resolution is for the dismissal
of the complaint.


x x x." (Emphasis supplied)


Indeed, under
the same rule, a preliminary investigation is concluded after the following
procedure, viz.:


"Sec. 3.  Procedure. - Except as provided for in
Section 7 hereon, no complaint or information for an offense cognizable by the
Regional Trial Court shall be filed without a preliminary investigation having
been first conducted in the following manner:


(a)  The complaint shall state the known address of the respondent and
be accompanied by affidavits of the complainant and his witnesses as well as
other supporting documents, in such number as copies as there are respondents,
plus two (2) copies for the official file.  The said affidavits shall be sworn to before any fiscal, state
prosecutor or government official authorized to administer oath, in their
absence or unavailability, a notary public, who must certify that he has personally
examined the affiants and that he is satisfied that they voluntarily executed
and understood their affidavits.


(b)  If the investigating officer finds no ground to continue with the
inquiry, he shall dismiss the complainant.  Otherwise, he shall issue a subpoena to the respondent, attaching
thereto a copy of the complaint, affidavits and other supporting documents and
granting him ten (10) days from receipt within which he may submit
counter-affidavits and other supporting documents.  The respondent shall have the right to examine all other evidence
submitted by the complainants.


(c)  Such counter-affidavits and other supporting evidence submitted
by the respondent shall also be sworn to and certified as prescribed in
paragraph (a) hereof and copies thereof shall be furnished by him to the complainant.


(d)  If the respondent cannot be subpoenaed, or if subpoenaed does not
submit counter-affidavits within the ten (10) day period, the investigating
officer shall base his resolution on the evidence presented by the complainant.


(e)  If the investigating officer believes that there are matters to
be clarified, he may set a hearing to propound clarificatory questions to the
parties or their witnesses, during which the parties shall be afforded an
opportunity to be present but without the right to examine or
cross-examine.  If the parties so
desire, they may submit questions to the investigating officer which the latter
may propound to the parties or witnesses concerned."


(f)
       
Thereafter,
the investigation shall be deemed concluded, and the investigating officer
shall resolve the case within ten (10) days therefrom.  Upon the evidence thus adduced, the
investigating officer shall determine whether or not there is sufficient ground
to hold the respondent for trial.


Respondent judge
should have resolved the case within ten (10) days after the hearing where he
clarified the evidence of the parties and then, he should have forthwith
transferred the records to the provincial prosecutor for appropriate action.


It is also clear
that respondent judge gravely abused his discretion in issuing a warrant of
arrest against Bagunas.  No expediency
warranted the immediate arrest of Bagunas.  "Even if the judge finds probable cause, it is not mandatory for
him to issue a warrant of arrest x x x.  He must further find that there is a necessity of placing the respondent
under immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice."
[22]


We agree with
the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), that respondent insisted on
investigating complainant Bagunas due to his close association with the
latter's political rivals.  It appears
that Bagunas filed an election protest before the Regional Trial Court of
Guian, Eastern Samar, against Mayor Rodito Fabillar, a relative of respondent
judge, after the May 1995 local elections.
[23]
 As earlier stated, Bagunas filed a
graft and corruption case against COMELEC officer Angel Dacuno, who is also a
friend and relative of respondent judge.
[24]


As early as
1967, in the case of Pimentel v. Salanga,
[25]
 we drew the guidelines for judges
to follow where their impartiality is challenged by a party, viz.:


"A judge may not be legally
prohibited from sitting in a litigation.  But when suggestion is made of record that he might be induced to act in
favor of one party or with bias or prejudice against a litigant arising out of
circumstance reasonably capable of inciting such a state of mind, he should
conduct a careful self-examination.  He
should exercise his discretion in a way that the people's faith in the courts
of justice is not impaired.  A salutary
norm is that he reflect on the probability that a losing party might nurture at
the back of his mind the thought the judge had unmeritoriously tilted the
scales of justice against him.  That
passion on the part of a judge may be generated because of serious charges of
misconduct against him by a suitor or his counsel, is not altogether
remote.  He is a man, subject to the
frailties of other men.  He should,
therefore, exercise great care and caution before making up his mind to act or
withdraw from a suit where that party or counsel is involved.  He should in good grace inhibit himself
where the case could be heard by another judge and where no appreciable
prejudice would be occasioned to others involved therein.  On the result of his decisions to sit or not
to sit may depend to a great extent the all-important confidence in the
impartiality of the judiciary.  If after
reflection he should resolve to voluntarily desist from sitting in a case where
his motives or fairness might be seriously impugned, his action is to be
interpreted as giving meaning and substance to the second paragraph of Section
1, Rule 137.  He serves the cause of the
law who forestalls miscarriage of justice.
