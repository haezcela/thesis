PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. DOMINADOR PILI Y ORTIZ, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


In view of the
intrinsic nature of rape where only two persons are usually involved, courts
are cautioned to minutely scrutinize the words and actions of the victim.  In this case, we meticulously examined the
testimony of the complainant, but we find no reason to disturb the trial
courtâs finding which gave it full faith and credence.


The Case


This is an
appeal from the Decision
[1]
 dated December 22, 1995 of the
Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 219, in Criminal Case No.
Q-94-55418 convicting Dominador Pili 
y
 Ortiz of rape.
[2]


In a Complaint
dated March 9, 1994, Fe Dejucos Revilla accused Dominador Pili of rape.  Assistant City Prosecutor Leonil G. Reas
treated the said Complaint as the Information and filed it in the
aforementioned Court, with a certification that the accused opted not âto avail
himself of the right to preliminary investigation.â
[3]
 The accusatory portion of the
Information reads as follows:


âThe undersigned accuses
DOMINADOR PILI y CORTEZ [sic] of the crime of RAPE committed as follows:


That on or about the 6th
day of March, 1994, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused by means of
force and intimidation, to wit: by [sic] then and there wilfully, unlawfully
and feloniously at knife point undress the undersigned and thereafter have
carnal knowledge with the undersigned complainant against her will and without
her consent.


CONTRARY TO LAW.â
[4]


Upon
arraignment, the accused, assisted by Counsel Henry B. Inting of the Public
Attorneyâs Office,
[5]
 pleaded not guilty.  After trial, the lower court rendered the
assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, finding the
accused DOMINADOR PILI guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of [r]ape,
defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended
by R.A. 7659, the Court hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of 
[r]eclusion
[p]erpetua
, to pay the complainant the amount of 
P
30,000.00 as moral
damages, and to pay the costs.â 


Hence, this
appeal.
[6]


The Facts


Version of the Prosecution


The
prosecutionâs version of the facts, as summarized by the solicitor general in
the Appelleeâs Brief, is as follows:
[7]


âAt around 8:00 oâclock in
the evening of 6 March 1994, private complainant Fe Revilla [âFe,â for brevity]
was in the company of long time friends Raquel Castaneda and Carlito Ocenas who
came to visit her at her house in Freedom Park III, Batasan Hills, Quezon City
(TSN, 7 June 1994, pp. 3-4).


While enjoying their
tattle, appellant and his Muslim companion, Ashmad, unexpectedly arrived.  The two joined in the conversation when
suddenly, appellant pulled out a fan knife and jeered, âTrip kong manggulo
ngayonâ [I feel like creating trouble] (
Ibid
., p. 5).


Thereafter, Ashmad left the
group.  Meantime, Fe and her friends
were immobilized with fear and apprehension over appellantâs conduct (
Ibid.
).


Soon, appellant left the
house (
Ibid.
).  Feeling quite
relieved, Fe rose from her seat to prepare coffee.  Minutes later, however, appellant came back, still in his
uncharacteristic mood, and reiterating that he wants to stir trouble (
Ibid.,

p. 6).


Since Raquel and Carlito
became apprehensive of appellantâs presence, they left without even tasting
their coffee (
Ibid.,
 p. 6).


Taking advantage of Feâs
sudden isolation, appellant bodily seized her and told her to go to bed with
him (
Ibid.,
 p. 7).  Initially, Fe
resisted.  When appellant, however,
aimed his knife at Fe while the latter was already tangled in his embrace,
Fe  could only plead for mercy and
entreat appellant about her children and the consequences of his act.


Ostensibly unmoved by her
cry for mercy, appellant pushed Fe to the nearby bed, about five (5) steps away
(
Ibid.,
 p. 9).  Thereafter,
appellant pulled down his trousers and went on top of his victim.  Appellant thereafter slid his victimâs one-length
dress up to her shoulders and removed her underwear.  Then, appellant introduced his organ into hers and began to pump
until apparently he realized that his victim was menstruating. (
Ibid.,

p. 11).


Appellant inquired from Fe
if indeed she was menstruating and despite receiving an affirmation, appellant
lit a lighter and checked on his victimâs pudendum (
Ibid.,
 p. 11).  Although he already pulled out his organ
from his victim, appellant now took time in kissing his victim all over her
face (
Ibid.,
 pp. 11-12).


Fe could now only cry.  When a vehicle suddenly blew its horn, Fe
distracted appellant by saying that a visitor just came (
Ibid., 
p.
12).  Appellant said he could not
care.  When a carâs horn again sounded,
Fe reiterated that a cousin may have arrived (
Ibid.,
 p. 13).


This time, appel[l]ant
budged.  Taking this as her cue,  Fe pushed appellant and ran as fast as she
could (
Ibid.
).


Fe scampered to the
direction of the Barangay Lupon (
Ibid.,
 p. 13).  By chance, Rev. Reynaldo Cabangon [âRev.
Cabangon,â for brevity], a pastor, happened to meet a distressed Fe on the road
who was crying and uttering that she was raped and molested by a certain
âDomengâ (TSN, 7 June 1994, p. 14).


At around 10:40 oâclock
that evening of the same date, Feâs sworn statement was taken (Exh. âC,â
Records, p. 85).


The following morning, or
on 7 March 1994 at 11:00 oâclock a.m., a medical examination was conducted on
private complainant.


Thus,
Medico-Legal Report No. M-0429-94 states:


âSPECIMEN
SUBMITTED:


Person of
Fe D. Revilla, about 38 years old and a resident of Freedom Park 3, Batasan

At around 8:45 oâclock in
the evening of 7 March 1994, police officers apprehended appellant at his
residence in 98 Freedom Park, Batasan Hills, Quezon City, where appellant
voluntarily came with the police officers to the precinct for investigation
(TSN, 31 Aug. 1994, pp. 6-8).


On 9 March 1994, private
complainant Fe Revilla signed a complaint for [r]ape against appellant.â


Version of the Defense


Appellant
interposes denial and alibi.  In the
Appellantâs Brief, the defense adopted the trial courtâs narration as its
version of the facts, which is reproduced as follows:
[8]


âThe accused DOMINADOR
PILI, 38 years old carpenter, married, and a resident of 98 Dama de Noche St.,
Freedom Park, Batasan Hills, Quezon City.  His testimony was offered to deny the allegations stated in the Information

the residence of Ricardo Malto at Freedom Park, Batasan Hills, Quezon City

house of Johnny Corpuz also at Freedom Park to borrow a betamax tape; that he

of a rechargeable lamp; that when he reached home, his wife prepared coffee and
they talked about the preparation for her birthday the next day, March 7; that

that he was familiar with the house of the complainant because it is very near
his place and he was the one who made its window upon the order of his brother;
and that the door of her house is that of a refrigerator.


He further told the Court
that sometime in May, 1992, he was living with his brother Ricardo, his parents
and his family at his present address; that at the time, Ricardo whose wife was
then working in Saudi Arabia, was cohabiting with the complainant, whose
husband in turn was in the Bahamas; that he and his mother, who was living with
them in an extended room, did not approve of their relationship; that the
relationship ended upon the arrival of Ricardoâs wife in November 1993; that
Ricardo and the complainant actually separated sometime in January, 1994, and
he felt good about the separation but he had no ill feeling against her when
she left; that he told the two to end their relationship because it was
embarras[s]ing to her sister-in-law but the complainant told him that someday
he and his brother would kneel before her; that the complainant had been
harboring ill feelings against him because of his objection to their
relationship; that the complainant testified in his favor in another criminal
case which he filed against a certain Rex Lucero, before the rape incident
happened; that she testified for him because of his brother; and that despite
her favorable testimony, he still disapproved of their relatio[n]ship.

1993; that because of the severance, the complainant told him that he and the

Ever Emporium at Commonwealth Avenue and invited her for a talk; that when he
asked her if his brother did rape her, she just laughed; and that the

was offered to establish the fact that sometime in December, 1993, the

He narrated that he came to
know the complainant, through Ricardo Pili, during a dance session held every

her live-in partner; that one Friday, the complainant angrily told him, in the

of her house opens toward the inside (Exh. J and J-1); that she does not know
Orlando Tigolo so she could not have danced with, or talk to him, and she saw
him for the first time in court; and that sometime [sic] attended the social

As earlier stated, the
defense presented Gil Piquero and Ricardo Pili as sur-rebuttal witnesses. Their
respective testimonies are as follows:

married, self employed and a resident of 91 Everlasting St., Freedom Park III,
Batasan Hills, Quezon City.  The
testimony of the witness was offered to show that he is the Purok leader of
Freedom Park 3, Batasan Hills, Quezon City, and that he personally knows that
the complainant and Ricardo Pili lived as husband and wife at Freedom Park III

holding the position of barangay secretary; that he knew the accused and his
brother because they were his neighbors; that, as a purok leader, he knew for a
fact that Ricardo Pili and the complainant were live-in partners for one (1)
year at Sgt. Piliâs house at Dama de Noche St., and that the accused
constructed her sari-sari store because he always passed by it on his way to
the multi-purpose hall; and that a certain Hatulan helped the accused construct
the sari-sari store.


On cross-examination, the witness
clarified that his friendship with the accused was not really personal byt
[sic] he knew the latter as a carpenter in their place; that Ricardo Pili was a
friend but not a close friend; that he is an accused in three cases, two
attempted homicide and one for acts of lasciviousness before the court; and
that the accused requested him to testify in his favor.â
[9]


The Issues


Appellant
submits the following assignment of errors:
[10]


âI


The trial court committed
serious errors in the appreciation of the evidence presented both by the
prosecution and the defense which amount to grave abuse of discretion.


II


Certain material unrebutted
facts were brushed aside which, if properly appreciated, would tilt the scale
toward the innocence of the accused.


III


The quantum of evidence
required to overthrow the presumption of innocence has not been mustered
contrary to the trial courtâs findings.â


Simply put,
appellant questions the trial courtâs assessment of the credibility of the
witnesses and the sufficiency of the prosecutionâs evidence.


The Courtâs Ruling


The appeal is
bereft of merit.


Credibility of Witnesses


It is
doctrinally settled that âthe assessment of the credibility of witnesses and
their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court, because of its
unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their
demeanor, conduct and attitude under grilling examination.  These are the most significant factors in
evaluating the sincerity of witnesses and in unearthing the truth, especially in
the face of conflicting testimonies.  Through its observations during the entire proceedings, the trial court
can be expected to determine, with reasonable discretion, whose testimony to
accept and which witness to disbelieve.  Verily, findings of the trial court on such matters will not be
disturbed on appeal unless some facts or circumstances of weight have been
overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted so as to materially affect the
disposition of the case.â
[11]
 In the instant case, appellant has
failed to present any substantial evidence or argument to convince us to modify
or reverse the findings of the trial court.  On the contrary, after careful examination of the records, we find the
trial courtâs judgment, except the grant of moral damages, worthy of
affirmation.


This Court has
repeatedly expressed that âin view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape
where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant
must be scrutinized with extreme caution.â
[12]
 In keeping with this principle, we
exhaustively examined the complainantâs testimony and found it sufficient to
support the conviction of rape.


Carnal knowledge
of a woman constitutes rape under any of the following instances: (1) when
force or intimidation is used; (2) when the woman is deprived of reason or is
otherwise unconscious; or (3) when she is under twelve years of age.
[13]
 In  the present case, complainant testified that  appellant,  intimidating  her  with  a  knife,  forced  himself upon her.  Her testimony
is as follows:

The above-quoted
testimony is bereft of equivocation and constitutes an unmistakable narration
of consummated rape.  âIt is a truism
that when an alleged victim of rape says that she was violated, she says in
effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on her, and
so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be
convicted on the basis thereof.â
[15]
 This is so in the instant case, in
which the trial court found the testimony of the complainant âplausible and
credible.â
[16]


âThe rule in
rape cases is that physical resistance need not be established when
intimidation is exercised upon the victim and the latter submits herself, against
her will, to the rapistâs embrace because of fear for life and personal
safety.â
[17]
 The complainant clearly testified
that appellant brandished a knife at her and threatened to kill her with
it.  She was obviously cowed into
submission by the real and present threat of physical  harm  on her person.  Besides, although no laceration was found on
the genital area of the victim, who had had four children, the abrasion on her
left shoulder is enough evidence of the struggle that ensued.
[18]


Several
witnesses corroborated the testimony of the complainant on the circumstances
before and after the alleged act.  Among
them was Carlito Ocenar who positively testified that the accused was present
in the house of the complainant on the evening of March 6, 1994:


âPROS. PURUGANAN:


Q
     
Mr. Witness, do you remember where you were
on March 6, 1994?


WITNESS:


A
     
Yes, [maâam].


PROS. PURUGGANAN:


Q
     
Tell the Honorable Court what date and
time?


A
     
At about 7:00 oâclock in the evening,
more or less, I was at the house of Fe Revilla, a victim of this case[;] my
companion was her friend Raquel Castaneda, maâam.


Q
     
Why were
you in the house of the complainant on said date and time?


A
     
Because they were friend
[sic] and they were conversing because they have not seen each other for a long
time, [maâam].


Q
     
What
happened while you and Raquel sere [sic] conversing with the complainant?


A
     
While we were talking [with]
each other, all of a sudden two (2) male persons arrived and their name[s] are
Dominador Pili and a certain Asmad, a certain Muslim, [maâam].


Q
     
What
happened when Dominador Pili and a certain Asmad, the Muslim, arrived?


A
     
While we were inside the
house of the victim, all of a sudden Asmad immediately went home and after that
Dominador Pili brought out a fan knife brandishing the knife in front of the
complainant and us, [maâam].


Q
     
What did
you do when Dominador Pili [was] brandishing the knife?


A
     
What I did while sitting, I signed to
Raquel no [sic] to [be] afraid because they were neighbors, [maâam].


Q
     
What
happened next, Mr. [W]itness?


A
     
After that
while Dominador Pili [was] brandishing his beinte nueve (29) Raquel asked
permission to leave because she was afraid and I go [sic] with her, [maâam].â
[19]


After a close
observation of the demeanor on the stand of said witness, whose narration
tallied with that of the complainant, the trial court characterized him as
reliable and credible.


Pastor Reynaldo
Cabangonâs testimony on what transpired after the alleged molestation, in turn,
dovetails with complainantâs narration.  He recounted that he was on his way to the radio station when he saw the
complainant in the vicinity of the chapel.
[20]
 He said that the complainant, who
was crying, asked his help, as she was raped and molested by a certain
âDoming.â
[21]
 He brought her to the 
Barangay
Lupon
 and left her there, because he had to go to the radio station.
[22]
 The trial court
[23]
 observed, and we agree, that the
testimony of said witness was limited to what he personally knew, and that his
story was believable and trustworthy.


The complainant
testified that Pastor Cabangon brought her to the 
Barangay Lupon
, where
he referred her to Ramon Erfello, another 
Lupon
 member, who subsequently
brought her to the police station.
[24]
 This was confirmed by Cabangon
[25]
 and SPO3 Abdon Micosa.  On the witness stand, the latter testified
that the complainant went to the police station to file a complaint.  Thereafter, he was asked by the desk officer
to accompany said complainant to the place where the accused could possibly be
apprehended.
[26]
 The trial court commented that this
âproves the fact that the complainant did not waste time in making an outcry
after the harrowing experience.â
[27]


Appellant
contends that certain portions of the testimony of complainant are patently
false and inconsistent with ordinary human experience and the normal order of
things.  The defense stresses that it is
unimaginable how the accused-appellant could poke a knife at the right side of
the complainantâs body when they were facing each other, with the left hand of
accused-appellant embracing the complainant.  If accused-appellant was holding the knife with his right hand, he must
have poked it at the left side of complainantâs body.
[28]
 We are not persuaded.  The partners must have been constantly moving
as the ravager tried to pin down the victim, who tried to struggle away until,
overcome by force, she succumbed to the intimidation.


The defense also
points out: âWe are amazed how the penis of the accused-appellant [could] be
inside complainantâs vagina while the former [was] in a kneeling position, his
right hand holding a lighter probing the latterâs vagina if she had
menstruation.â
[29]
 This is a clutch at straws.  The acts described were not necessarily
simultaneous.  That the narration of the
events, which were in themselves traumatic, was less than letter-perfect is
understandable, considering that the story was extracted through questions and
answers in open court.


The defense also
asks why the victim did not escape when the first opportunity presented
itself.  This is really a minor
point.  When a rape victim becomes
paralyzed with fear, she cannot be expected to think and act coherently.  Her failure to immediately take advantage of
the early opportunity to escape does not automatically vitiate the credibility
of her account.  In any event, the Court
notes that she eventually managed to escape.


Next, appellant
contends that the medical finding does not support the claim of the complainant
[30]
 that her thigh was caught in the
door as she wrestled with the accused.  Again, this is captious reasoning.  It is common knowledge that the constitution and physical make-up of
individuals vary.  The fact that no
abrasion or contusion was found on complainantâs left thigh does not
necessarily negate the possibility that, indeed, her left thigh was caught in
the door.


The defense
further argues that complainantâs narration of the attempted apprehension of
the accused on the day of the incident itself is implausible.
[31]
 If the policemen went to the house
of the accused to apprehend him, they should have been more assertive of their
right to enforce their duty.  This is
easily explained by the fact that the policemen could not have arrested the
accused, as they had no warrant of arrest.  Hence, they only invited him for questioning.


The defense
likewise asserts that if the appellant was really guilty, he would have
escaped, considering that he had stayed in his house the next day, after having
been apprised of the complaint lodged against him the night before.  It contends that the non-flight of the
accused is a categorical indicium of innocence.  We do not agree.  This
Court has repeatedly held that âthere is no law or principle which guarantees
that non-flight 
per se 
is proof, let alone conclusive proof, of oneâs
innocence and, as in the case of alibi, such defense is unavailing when placed
astride the undisputed fact that there is positive identification of the
felon.â
[32]


The defense also
assails the credibility of Carlito Ocenar.  If said witness really saw the accused brandishing a knife and uttering
threatening statements, he should have asked the neighbors or the authorities
for assistance.  His abject indifference
to the danger that lurked around a friend is labeled as abnormal.  We cannot subscribe to this idea.  It is true that said witness -- as a
concerned citizen, more so as a friend -- should have done something to help
the complainant.  But it must be
stressed that not everyone can be expected to be brave and heroic.  As stated by the trial court  in its decision, âgone are the days of the
knights in shining armor.â
[33]
 His cowardice or unconcern does
not, by itself, negate the credibility of his corroborative testimony.


Finally,
appellant ascribes ill motive to the complainant who allegedly wanted to hit
back at him for his opposition to her extramarital affair with his
brother.  To quote the appellant:
âApparently, the trial court has become oblivious of the commonplace occurrence
in our midst that crimes more heinous and dastardly than rape have been
committed in the name and by reason of âLOVEâ or lack thereof.  A spurned or abandoned suitor or lover is at
times driven by a devilish force to commit acts only heartless beasts can do.â
[34]
 We disagree.  The alleged ill motive, even if true, is too
flimsy and inconsequential.  Granting 
arguendo

that the accused and the complainant did not get along well, the Court does not
see how the complainant, a married woman, could demean her womanhood, risk
public censure, and expose herself to the rigors, embarrassments and headaches
of a public trial, if her motive was other than to secure justice.


Denial and Alibi


In comparison
with the clear and straightforward testimony of the complainant and her
witnesses, the defenses of denial and alibi, which appellant relies upon, are
discredited and shopworn.  âIn the case
of alibi, it is elementary case law that the requirements of time and place be
strictly complied with by the defense, meaning that the accused must not only
show that he was somewhere else but that it was also physically impossible for
him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.â
[35]
 This the defense utterly failed to
do.  The appellant testified that he was
watching basketball in the house of Ricardo Malto when the incident happened.
[36]
 He stated further that the distance
between the house of Ricardo and that of the offended party could be traversed
in âa minute, maybe 2 to 3 minutes.â
[37]
 Clearly, the proximity of the
houses in question refutes the defense of alibi.  In any event, âwe have ruled so many times to the point of
triteness that denial and alibi cannot prevail over positive identification.â
[38]


Damages


The trial court
awarded moral damages to the complainant in the amount of 
P
30,000.  This award cannot be sustained for lack of evidentiary
basis, no proof having been adduced in its support.  On the other  hand,
civil  indemnity  of  
P
50,000  must  be awarded in line with current jurisprudence.  Such award is automatically given to the offended party without
need of further evidence other than the fact of the commission of the rape.
[39]


WHEREFORE,
 the appeal is DENIED and the
assailed Decision is AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that Appellant Dominador
Pili is ordered to PAY Fe Revilla the amount of 
P
50,000 as civil
indemnity, but the  award of moral
damages is DELETED.  Costs against
appellant.


SO ORDERED.
