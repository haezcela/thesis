PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. ORLANDO PALLARCO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




PANGANIBAN, J.:


As a defense,
alibi is inherently unreliable and easy to fabricate.  It cannot prevail over the positive identification of the
appellant by a credible eyewitness who has no ill motive to testify falsely.


The Case


The Court
applies this principle in denying the appeal of Orlando Pallarco from the
Decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch
15 of Ozamis City,
[2]
 convicting him of murder and
sentencing him to 
reclusion perpetua
.


In an
Information dated September 20, 1993, First Assistant Provincial Prosecutor
Liben Go Medina of Ozamis City charged appellant as follows:


âThat on or about the 30th day of
July, 1993, at about 8:30 oâclock in the evening, more or less, in barangay
Pan-ay, municipality of Clarin, province of Misamis Occidental, Philippines,
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused,
with intent to kill, armed with a handgun revolver, with evident premeditation,
taking advantage of the darkness of the night, did then and there, willfully,
unlawfully, treacherously and suddenly shot [sic] the victim JESUS JERUSALEM,
thereby inflicting upon the latter, gunshot wound on the head, which caused the
instantaneous death of the said victim.â
[3]


Assisted by his
counsel 
de oficio
, Graciano R. BaÃ±osia of the Public Attorneyâs Office
(PAO), appellant entered a plea of not guilty.
[4]
 After trial in due course, the
lower court rendered the assailed Decision, the decretal portion of which
reads:


âWHEREFORE, finding accused Orlando
Pallarco guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder qualified by treachery,
without other modifying circumstances, this Court sentences him to 
reclusion
perpetua
 and orders him to pay the heirs of Jesus Jerusalem death indemnity
of 
P
50.000.00.  With costs
against accused.â
[5]


Hence, this
appeal.
[6]


The Facts 
Version of the Prosecution


The prosecution
presented as witnesses (1)  Apolonio
Enomar Jr.
[7]
 and (2)  Diogenes
[8]
 Salazar,
[9]
 eyewitnesses who were with the
victim at the time of the assault; and (3)  Mrs. Evangelista Jerusalem,
[10]
 the widow.
[11]
 The antecedent facts, as summarized
by the trial court and adopted by the solicitor general in the Appelleeâs
Brief,
[12]
 are reproduced hereunder:


â2.
           
Apolonio
Enomar, Jr. - eyewitness, declared that on July 30, 1993 at 8:00 p.m., he was
at home in Pan-ay, Clarin, Mis. Occ. with Diogenes Salazar and the victim Jesus
Jerusalem, drinking beer in the kitchen; suddenly accused appeared at the door
and shot Jerusalem three times on the head with a revolver, hitting him at the
nape; victim had his back to accused; victim died; accused has been [his]
neighbor for 10 years.


3.
 
Diogenes
Salazar, eyewitness, declared that on July 30, 1993, he was at the house of
Apolonio Enomar Jr. drinking beer with victim Jesus Jerusalem in the kitchen;
the victim was shot by the accused who has been his friend and neighbor for 20
years; he saw accused shoot the victim - he was just one meter away; accused
just came in through the kitchen door and shot the victim on the head with a
short firearm; he fired three shots and ran away; there was a gas lamp in the
kitchen; on cross, he admitted that he executed an affidavit to the effect that
he did not know the assailant; that he complained to Atty. Alegria CariÃ±o that
his affidavit was not correct[,] so upon advice, he executed another affidavit
before Pros. Daomilas in Ozamis City to the effect that he knows the assailant.


[4].
          
Evangelista Jerusalem, widow of the victim, declared that
Apolonio Enomar Jr. told her at the wake of her husband that he and Diogenes
Salazar witnessed the shooting of her husband so she went to Diogenes[â] house
to ask him to testify; accused and her husband Jesus Jerusalem had an earlier
altercation at the weekly barangay market caused by accusedâs failure to pay
her husbandâs winnings in a cockfight.â
[13]


Version of the Defense 


Setting up alibi
and denial, the defense presented  1)  Vicente Siao,
[14]
 barangay captain of Pan-ay where
the killing took place;  (2)  Jose Roque,
[15]
 who was allegedly with the
appellant in a drinking spree at the time of the incident; and (3) appellant
himself.
[16]


Appellant
presented in his Brief
[17]
 his own version of the facts, as
follows:


âx x x [I]n the afternoon of July
30, 1993, accused-appellant was selling his tomato harvest in the market place
of Pan-ay, Clarin, Misamis Occidental, when he met Jose Roque, an
acquaintance.  Roque invited Pallarco to
his house because he will butcher a dog.  At about six in the evening, Jose Roque, Orlando Pallarco and one
Meliton Batlag proceeded to the formerâs house.  They prepared and cooked the dogâs meat.  Thereafter, they drank tuba and ate dogâs
meat.  At about 8:30 oâclock in the
evening, they heard three (3) gun shot[s] coming from the direction of the
market place.  A commotion followed
shortly, prompting Pallarco and Batlag to verify.  The duo went to the market place and notice[d] people milling
around Apolonio Enomarâs house.  Curious,
Pallarco entered Enomarâs kitchen and saw Jesus Jerusalem dead on the
floor.  Some policemen were present at
the crime scene.  Policeman Calinga and
Taylaran requested the appellant to turn the cadaver upside and to look for any
identification or firearm.  Thereafter,
Batlag and Pallarco returned to Roqueâs house to resume their drinking session.
They went home at ten in the evening.  Accused-appellant denied killing Jesus Jerusalem.  He never quarreled with Jerusalem but he
once had an altercation with alleged eyewitness Apolonio Enomar, Jr. when he
refused to give the latter a bottle of Tanduay rhum.


âIn the early morning after the
shooting incident, Barangay Captain Vicente Siao of Pan-ay, Clarin, Misamis
Occidental, went to the market place after he learned that somebody was killed
there the night before.  He proceeded to
Enomarâs house, the scene of the incident.  He saw Enomar and Salazar and inquired from them who killed Jesus
Jerusalem.  The duo told the barangay
captain that they failed to identify the gun man because it wa s very
dark.  Siao observed that Enomarâs
kitchen was lighted with a gas lamp and there was no other source of
illumination outside the kitchen.  (TSN,
pp. 2-8, August 26, 1994; pp. 2-14, September 21, 1994; pp. 2-18, October 19,
1994).â
[18]


The Trial Courtâs Ruling


While, on the
one hand, the trial court belittled the testimony of Witness Diogenes Salazar
as ânot reliable [because] he flip-flopped from saying he identified the
assailant to declaring he did not,â
[19]
 on the other hand, it gave credence
to Apolonio Enomar Jr. by declaring:


âWitness Enomar spoke with
sincerity and conviction and positively identified accused.  There appeared no reason why he would
falsely testify against him.  [That] he
had told defense witness Siao the morning after the shooting that he was not
able to identify the assailant because it was dark is understandable.  This Court takes judicial notice of the
reluctance of witnesses to bandy about their knowledge of the identity of
assailants especially when these assailants are still on the loose.â
[20]


Assignment of Error


Appellant
assails the trial court on this ground:


âThe Court 
a quo 
gravely
erred in finding that the guilt of the accused-appellant for the crime charged has
been established beyond reasonable doubt.â
[21]


In the
main,  appellant disputes the trial
courtâs assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the sufficiency of
the evidence of his guilt.


This Courtâs Ruling


The appeal has
no merit.


Credibility of Prosecution Witness


Appellant argues
that the testimony of Prosecution Eyewitness Apolonio Enomar Jr. is not worthy
of credence for the following reasons:


1.
 
He
failed to immediately report the identity of the assailant to the police and
the widow.


2.
 
Prosecution
Witness Diogenes Salazar contradicted Enomarâs allegation that he recognized
the attacker.


3.
 
Corroborating
Salazar, Defense Witness Siao alleged that both Enomar Jr. and Salazar admitted
to him that they failed to recognize the gunman.


4.
 
Enomar
harbors an ill motive against the appellant.


We do not
agree.  Basic is the rule that appellate
courts will not disturb the trial courtâs assessment of the credibility of
witnesses, in the absence of proof that some fact or circumstance of substance
has been overlooked, or its significance misinterpreted which, if properly
appreciated, would affect the disposition of the case.  Having heard the witnesses and observed
their deportment on the stand, the trial judge is in a better position to
resolve such question.
[22]
 We have examined the records and
found no reason to depart from this well-settled rule.


Eyewitness
Enomarâs testimony is straightforward, credible and candid.  He narrated the incident thus:


âQ
   
Mr.
Apolonio Enomar, do you remember where were you on July 30, 1993 at around 8:30

Now,
considering that it was night time, it was already dark during that time?


A
    
There
was light.


Q
    
What
kind of light?


A
    
Ours
is kerosene lamp and outside is a fl[uo]rescent light.


Q
    
The
fl[uo]rescent is outside of your kitchen?


A
    
Outside
of my house near the other house fronting our house.


Q
    
So
the source of light that illumines your kitchen is only a gas lamp?


A
    
Gas
lamp and fl[uo]rescent light.


Q
    
But
you stated that the fl[uo]rescent is outside the kitchen near the other house?


A
    
Because
we have the same roof with that other house.


Q
    
But
you are using a gas lamp?


A
    
In
the kitchen because the fl[uo]rescent light is outside.


Q
    
The
question is, you are using a gas lamp in the kitchen because the fl[uo]rescent
lamp is not enough in your kitchen?


A
    
Yes,
sir because we used that for our table only.


Q
    
So
you and your friends were drinking beer na beer around the table?


A
    
Yes,
we were facing each other.


Q
    
And
you are facing the two of your friends, these Salazar and Jerusalem?


A
    
We
were facing with [sic] Deojenes Salazar.


Q
    
And
to whom did Jesus Jerusalem seated? [sic]


A
    
He
sat beside me.


Q
    
So
the two of you, Jerusalem and you were sitting with your back at the door of
your kitchen?


A
    
Side
view sir.


Q
    
To
which side of yours is the door on your kitchen, to your left or your right
side?


A
    
Left
side.


Q
    
And
where was Jesus Jerusalem sitted [sic] beside your right or left?


A
    
Jesus
Jerusalem was standing on my left side sir.


Q
    
So
Jesus Jerusalem was not sitting beside you?


A
    
No,
sir.


Q
    
And
it was while Jesus Jerusalem was standing at your left that he was shot in the
head?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
At
the first time you noticed that he was shot, was when you heard shots?


A
    
When
it [sic] turned my head sir.


Court
         
The first time you saw the accused was when you heard shot
[sic]?


A
    
Yes,
Your Honor.


Court
                   
Proceed.


Q
    
And
there were three shots you heard according to you?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
It
was a successive shots? [sic]


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
What
was your reaction at the first time you heard a shot?


A
    
I
only looked at the accused or gunman.


Q
    
You
mean to say you did not try to take cover to avoid being hit?


A
    
No,
sir.


Q
    
And
Jesus Jerusalem was shot while he was at your left side?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
And
it was only a matter of second[s] when a person entered the kitchen and shot
Jesus Jerusalem?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
Now,
after shooting Jesus Jerusalem the person immediately went out?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
And
because of that very brief span of time, you were not able to look exactly [at]
Jesus Jerusalem?


A
    
I
have looked at him closely.


Q
    
You
mean to say you were able to look at the assailants [sic] closely to be able to
recognize him?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
Now,
what was the pants  worn by the
assailants [sic]?


A
    
He
was wearing a âpurolâ or short pants.


Q
    
What
about his shirt?


A
    
T-shirt
yellow sando, with black stripe, and a cloth covering his head.


Q
    
Now,
because the assailant was covering a portion of his head, you could not
actually see his hair?


A
    
I
can see his hair.â
[23]


Enomar
positively identified the appellant as the person who shot Jesus
Jerusalem.  He saw the incident because
the 
locus criminis
 was illuminated by a kerosene lamp, and such
illumination has been held sufficient to permit the identification of a
malefactor.
[24]
 Moreover, the witness saw the face
of the appellant when the latter shot the victim who was beside him at the
time.  He could not have failed to
recognize the appellant, for they had known each other for almost ten years.


We do not
subscribe to the argument of the defense that the testimony of Salazar
contradicts that of Enomar Jr.  It
appears from the transcript of stenographic notes that Witness Salazar
identified Appellant Pallarco as the assailant, and thereafter denied having
seen Pallarco shoot the victim.  At this
point, the judge stopped the hearing and declared that the witness was a
âliar.â
[25]
 In her decision, she plainly
labeled Salazar as âunreliableâ and firmly rejected his testimony.  Hence, the testimony of Salazar could not
have contradicted that of Enomar Jr. or provided a basis for the conviction of
appellant.  Rather, Salazar contradicted
only himself.  In any event, we
reiterate that the trial courtâs evaluation of the credibility of a witness, as
a rule,  is accorded respect and
finality by the appellate courts.  And
we see no error in its evaluation of Salazar.


Appellant also
casts doubts on Enomarâs account because said witness allegedly delayed
reporting the identity of the malefactor.  Jurisprudence teaches that delay in revealing the identity of the
perpetrators of a crime does not necessarily impair the credibility of a
witness, especially where such witness gives a sufficient explanation.
[26]
 The eyewitness in the present
case  did give such an  explanation -- he was afraid of appellant.
[27]
 This Court has already taken
âjudicial notice of the actuality that witnesses in this country are usually
reluctant to volunteer information about a criminal case or are unwilling to be
involved in or dragged into criminal investigations.â
[28]
 That Enomar subsequently overcame
his fear should not destroy his credibility.  For the Court to unreasonably discredit Enomarâs account for the reason
that it was delayed, as appellant bids, is to permanently seal the lips of
reluctant and timorous witnesses. 


We also dismiss
the contention of Defense Witness Siao that, upon reaching the crime scene, he
was informed by Enomar and Salazar that they were unable to identify the
assailant because it was dark.
[29]
 
First
, Enomar testified that
he did not notice the presence of Siao.
[30]
 Salazar likewise stated that he did
not remember having talked to Siao.
[31]
 
Second
, assuming that Enomar
did see Siao at the time, the formerâs reluctance to relate the incident to
Siao who was the barangay captain is explained by his subsequent admission that
fear kept him from immediately reporting what he knew to the police or other
persons in authority.  As earlier
observed, this delay does not lessen Enomarâs credibility.


Appellant also
claims that Witness Enomar bore a grudge against him because he once refused to
give said witness a bottle of Tanduay Rhum.  This argument scarcely deserves consideration.  We find it incredible that a person will falsely testify against
another, with the possibility of consigning him to prison for the rest of his
life, just to spite him for refusing to give him a bottle of liquor.  Ill motive cannot rest on such a flimsy
excuse.  In the absence of any evidence
indicating that the principal witness for the prosecution was moved by any
improper motive, the presumption is that he was not so moved, and his testimony
is thus entitled to full faith and credit.
[32]


Alibi


Nor can we
accept the defense of alibi.  For this
defense to prosper, appellant must prove not only that he was somewhere else
when the offense was committed but also that it was physically impossible for
him to have been at the crime scene or its immediate vicinity.
[33]
 Appellant utterly failed to
demonstrate either one.


In his
testimony, appellant merely stated that he was drinking with Roque when the
crime was committed.  He failed to
specify, however, how far he was from the crime scene, or how long it would
take to traverse the distance.  Worse,
his own witness, Jose Roque, alleged that they were only one hundred meters
away from the 
locus criminis
.  We
are not convinced by Roqueâs inconclusive and even evasive testimony, the
pertinent parts of which are reproduced below:


âQ
   
You
also mentioned that you met Meliton Batlag, and Orlando Pallarco on what date
was that when you went to your house and eat [sic] dog meat?


A
    
July
30, 1993 Friday.


Q
    
You
mentioned also that it was only 100 meters [to] your house from the market[,]
am I correct?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
And
do you know the house of one Apolonio Enomar, Jr.?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
How
far is it from the public market?


A
    
Very
near.


Q
    
You
mean to say your house and the house of Apolonio Enomar, Jr. is also very near?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Court
         
If this is your house, where is the house of Apolonio Enomar
located? please point.


A
    
From
my seat to the national highway (Estimated to be 100 meters).


Court
                   
Proceed.


Q
    
You
mean to say from your house going to the house of Apolonio Enomar, Jr. if you
are just in ordinary walk between the two distance it would only take four
minutes? [sic]


A
    
Yes,
sir


Q
    
Now,
if one has to run from your house going to the house of Apolonio Enomar, Jr.,
would you say that it would only take around one or two minutes to run?


A
    
It
depends sir, if you run fast or slow.


Q
    
If
you run slow how long would it take you?


A
    
One
or two minutes.

A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
You
would not know what kind of explosion was that because you were eating inside
your house?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
In

Atty. BaÃ±osa
        
Objection Your Honor, misleading.

A
    
I
am not certain Your Honor, the distance is 100 meters.


Pros. Medina

did you drink?


A
    
Tuba.â

Although Roque
refused to make a categorical statement on how long it would take to reach the
crime scene from his house, he did state that the distance was only one hundred
meters.  Clearly, appellant was in the
immediate vicinity of the 
locus criminis.


Well-settled is
the rule that alibi is a weak defense not only because it is inherently
unreliable but also because it is easy to fabricate.
[35]
 In the absence of strong and
convincing evidence, as in this case, alibi cannot prevail over the positive
identification of the appellant by an eyewitness who  has  no  improper  motive  to  testify  falsely.
[36]
 Such  defense  must  necessarily  fail.


Murder


The trial court
correctly appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery or 
alevosia
.
[37]
 There is treachery âwhen the
offender commits any of the crimes against the person employing means, methods,
or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure
its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the
offended party might make.â
 
[38]
 
It is present when the attack comes without
warning,  is sudden and unexpected and
the unsuspecting victim is not in a position to parry the assault.
[39]
 In this case, the victim was
drinking with his friends, unarmed and in no position to defend himself when
the appellant suddenly appeared and shot him thrice.  Clearly, treachery qualified the killing.


We cannot,
however, appreciate the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and
nighttime which were alleged in the Information.  Evident premeditation must be proven with clear and convincing
evidence.
[40]
 That is, the prosecution must show
the following: (1)  the time when the
accused determined to commit the crime, (2)  an act manifestly indicating that the accused clung to his
determination, and (3)  a sufficient
lapse of time between such a determination and its execution to allow him to
reflect upon the consequences of his act.
[41]
 The records do not show the
presence of these three conditions or any attempt on the part of the
prosecution to establish them.


Nor can the
aggravating circumstance of nighttime be appreciated, for the prosecution
failed to demonstrate (1) that the malefactor particularly sought or took
advantage of the darkness to commit the offense or (2) that nighttime
facilitated the commission of the crime.
[42]
 In any event, the prosecution
presented no evidence to establish the fact that 
nocturnity
 attended the
killing.  Nighttime cannot be considered
if it is shown that the place was adequately lighted;
[43]
 in this case, it was established
that the place was sufficiently illuminated by a kerosene lamp.


Being consistent
with current jurisprudence, the award of 
P
50,000 as indemnity is
affirmed.
