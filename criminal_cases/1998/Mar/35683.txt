PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. BOBBY LUSA Y GERVACIO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




ROMERO, J.:


At fourteen,
Michelle Lusa was abused, raped and impregnated by her own father, herein
accused-appellant Bobby Lusa.  Whatever
respect and affection she held for her own father was replaced with hatred and
antipathy.  The eldest of six children,
complainant lived with her family at Barangay Alcalde, Tibig, Silang, Cavite.


Sometime in the
second week of September 1993 at around 12 oâclock midnight, she was sleeping
with her younger brothers and sisters inside one of the rooms in their
house.  Suddenly, she felt someone
touching her private parts.  Recognizing
the intruder to be no other than her father, complainant  instinctively removed accused-appellantâs
hand and kicked him.  Fearful of
untimely discovery, the latter hurriedly left the room.  Complainant kept mum about the incident.


The first week
of October 1993 at 3 oâclock in the morning, complainant was again awakened
from her slumber when she felt someone on top of her.  Again, she recognized the intruder to be her father who was
reeking of liquor.  Complainant ventured
to stand up but accused-appellant ordered her to stay put and to keep
quiet.  Accused-appellant forcibly
removed complainantâs shorts and panty, and, notwithstanding her resistance,
succeeded in forcing himself on her.  Having spent his lust, accused-appellant warned complainant not to
reveal the incident to anybody, else she would be killed.


These sexual
assaults were repeated approximately ten times, the last  being perpetrated on March 28, 1994.  Three days later, complainant disclosed her
ordeals to her aunt when the latter accosted her about her growing abdomen.  Together with her aunt, she executed her 
Sinumpaang
Salaysay
[1]
 
on April 1, 1994 in which she narrated her painful
experience at the hands of her father at the Silang Police Station.  On April 4, 1994, she underwent an internal
examination by Dra. Engracia A. dela Cruz at the Municipal Health Office where
a medical certificate
[2]
 was issued with the following
findings:


    
- No
contusion


    
-
Hymen not intact


    
-
Vaginal canal admits 2 fingers


    
-
Last menstrual period - Sept. 5, 1993


    
-
Expected date - June 9, 1994


    
- Age
of gestation - 24 weeks


    
- IDI - April 4, 1994 - Pregnancy Test, Positive


Before her due
date, complainant went to Manila and stayed with the family of a certain
Bibes.  Ma. Elena Hernaes and her
brother, Jessie Hernaes offered support and comfort during this trying period. 


On July 21, 1994
complainant gave birth to a baby boy at Fabella Hospital.  Complainant eventually gave up her child for
adoption because she could not support him.


Based on her 
Sinumpaang
Salaysay 
and the medical certificate, complainant filed a complaint
[3]
 for rape against her father, herein
accused-appellant Bobby Lusa.  Consequently, an information
[4]
 dated May 30, 1994 was filed
charging the following:


âThat sometime in the month
of September 1993 and subsequent thereto, at Barangay Tibig, Municipality of
Silang, Province of Cavite, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs, by means of force,
violence and intimidation and taking advantage of his superior strength over
the person of his daughter who was then fourteen (14) years old, did, then and
there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, have carnal knowledge of said
Michelle A. Lusa, against the latterâs will and consent, to her damage and
prejudice.


CONTRARY
TO LAW.â


Upon
arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded ânot guilty.â  Trial on the merits proceeded and on April 12, 1995 the trial
court convicted accused-appellant of rape and accordingly sentenced him -


âx x x to suffer the
penalty of 
reclusion perpetua 
or life imprisonment; to pay the offended
party Michelle Lusa y Amon the amount of P50,000 by way of indemnity, P25,000
as moral damages, and P25,000 as exemplary damages, without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency in view of the penalty imposed upon the
accused, and to pay the costs.


SO ORDERED.â
[5]
 


In so ruling,
the court 
a quo
 observed that:


âIt is remarkable to note
from the evidence appearing on record that as against the clear, positive and straightforward
testimony of his accuser, complainant Michelle Lusa, the accused had nothing to
offer except his testimony denying having committed in any way the crime of
rape imputed against him.  Worse, to
make sure that such denial would work to his advantage, he even alluded an
accusation that Michelle Lusa could be a young woman of low morals, easy-to-get
and flirtatious. However, this inference has no positive effect on this Court
and that the same should be rejected as a shallow alibi of a desperate person
who later came to his senses and after realizing the seriousness of the offense
he committed, concocted this last-minute attempt on his part to cover up the
effects of his dastardly act, much less conceal his shame for the rape of his
very own flesh and blood.


As to the accusedâs claim
that the instant charge was inspired by his father-in-lawâs intense desire to
place him in jail for accusedâs failure to lend him money and alleged jealousy,
such an excuse is too lame to be legally accepted as true by this Court.  On the contrary, the Court, taking into
account the relationship between the accused and complainant as father and
daughter to each other, is of the firm belief that the latter has no plausible
reason to fabricate a story of rape against her own father, file a complaint in
the instant case, and expose herself to the public ridicule if not ignominy of
having to denounce the accused, her own father, about the sexual abuse done to
her, if in truth she was not raped x x x .â


In this appeal,
accused-appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding him guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.  


This Court is
not persuaded.  Accused-appellantâs
conviction must stand.


Accused-appellant
capitalizes on the disparity between compainantâs sworn statement in her 
Sinumpaang
Salaysay
 that she was first raped on September 1993 and her testimony
[6]
 in open court that her father only
touched her private part on said date.  The alleged inconsistencies in the 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
 and
complainantâs testimony in open court are so minor that it does not in any way
affect complainantâs credibility.  Moreover, it being the first time that her honor was violated,
complainant cannot be expected, from lack of experience, to be precise in her
testimonies.


It must be taken
into consideration that a 
Sinumpaang Salaysay
 is merely a short
narrative subscribed to by the complainant in question and answer form.  Thus, it is only to be expected that it is
not as exhaustive as oneâs testimony in open court.  The contradictions, if any, may be explained by the fact that an
affidavit can not possibly disclose the facts in their entirety, and may
inaccurately describe, without deponent detecting it, some of the occurences
narrated.  Being taken 
ex-parte
,
an affidavit is almost always incomplete and often inaccurate, sometimes from
partial suggestions, and sometimes from the want of suggestions and
inquiries.  It has thus been held that
affidavits are generally subordinated in importance to open court declarations because
the former are often executed when an affiantâs mental faculties are not in
such a state as to afford her a fair opportunity of narrating in full the
incident which has transpired.  Further,
affidavits are not complete reproductions of what the declarant has in mind
because they are generally prepared by the administering officer and the
affiant simply signs them after the same have been read to her.
[7]


Accused-appellant
next points out that the 
Certificate of Live Birth 
carried the name of
Jessie Hernaes as the father of complainantâs child.  That matter cannot, in any way, exonerate accused-appellant from
the crime of rape. As explained by complainant, she merely thought that the
hospital personnel asked her the name of the father for record purposes,
unaware of its significance.  Besides,
it was Jessieâs mother who volunteered the use of Jessieâs name in the records.
[8]
 Apparently, complainant was ashamed
to place on record that her sonâs father is likewise her own.  


Significantly,
the lower court found complainantâs testimony to be credible, convincing and
straightforward.  Courts usually give
credence to the testimony of a girl who is a victim of sexual assault,
particularly if it constitutes incestuous rape because, normally, no person
would be willing to undergo the humiliation of a public trial and to testify on
the details of her ordeal were it not to condemn an injustice.
[9]
 Needless to say, it is settled
jurisprudence that testimonies of child-victims are given full weight and
credit, since when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been
raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was
committed.
[10]
 Youth and immaturity are generally
badges of truth and sincerity.
[11]


As to
accused-appellantâs claim that he could not have raped his daughter inside a
room where his other children were also sleeping, it must be stressed that  lust  is no respecter of places.  Rape
can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the
roadside, within school premises, inside a house where there are several
occupants and even in the same room where other members of the family are
sleeping.
[12]
 It is therefore neither impossible
nor incredible that accused-appellant could have raped his eldest daughter
inside a room where her siblings were also sleeping.


Accused-appellant
also claims that the prosecutionâs failure to present complainantâs brother was
detrimental to its case.  Accused-appellant concluded that non-presentation of Arnold Lusa,
complainantâs brother who allegedly woke up and witnessed the rape incident,
only proves to show that, in truth and in fact, Arnold did not witness the
incident, consequently, there was no rape.  


This Court
cannot agree to such a timeworn excuse.  Failure on the part of the prosecution to present Arnold on the witness
stand did not in any way weaken the theory of the prosecution as the testimony
would only be corroborative.  In rape
cases, the prosecution is not bound to present witnesses other than the victim
herself, as an accused may be convicted solely on the testimony of the
complaining witness, provided such testimony is credible, natural, convincing
and otherwise consistent with human nature and the course of things.
[13]
 It needs no further corroboration
to warrant the conviction of the accused inasmuch as rape is normally witnessed
only by the participants, the victim and the abuser.  Besides, it is 
non sequitur
, without any basis whatsoever
to say that non-presentation of Arnold would mean that he did not witness the
incident or that there was no rape.


Likewise
, 
the
delay in reporting the incident should not be counted against complainant.  Being only fourteen years old when the
incident happened,  she was
understandably cowed into silence as the accused-appellant warned her not to divulge
the incident to anybody, otherwise she would be killed.  It has been held in a number of cases that
delay or vacillation in making a criminal accusation does not necessarily
impair the credibility of witnesses if such delay is satisfactorily explained.  Fear of reprisal, social humiliation,
familial considerations and economic reasons have been considered as sufficient
explanations.
[14]


In his attempt
to exculpate himself, accused-appellant denied having raped and impregnated her
daughter and shifted the blame instead to one Ramil Estrada, their former
househelp.  He alleged that Ramil and
his daughter Michelle were sweethearts and that the former promised to marry
his daughter but reneged on his promise.  Obviously, such testimony, aside from being pure hearsay, is also
uncorroborated.  Besides, it is
incredible for a young girl, still in her early teens, to falsely impute so
grave a crime as rape against her own father.  No ill-motive could be attributed on the part of complainant for her to
file this complaint against her own blood.  


In addition to
blaming somebody else for her daughterâs pregnancy, accused-appellant, further
claims that his father-in-law instigated the filing of this case against
him.  He reasoned  that his father-in-law holds a grudge
against  him for his refusal to lend him
money.  Aside from this, his
father-in-law suspected him of maintaining an affair with his mother-in-law.


This Court finds
such reasoning preposterous.  If indeed
his father-in-law harbored any grudge against him, then the former would not
have gone to accused-appellant for money.  Assuming that his father-in-law wanted to borrow money from him, the
former would not have begrudged the latter for refusing to lend him the money
as accused-appellant, per his own testimony, also needed the money to pay for
the goiter operation of his wife, his father-in-lawâs daughter.


Accused-appellantâs
conduct, when the police officers went to their house was quite revealing.  Upon seeing the latter talking to his wife,
he fled and hid for three hours; this despite the fact that he did not know why
the police officers were there.  This
Court finds accused-appellantâs reaction unusual and indicative of guilt.  


Accused-appellant,
however, should be convicted only of one count of rape as the prosecution
failed to establish and prove all the other rapes allegedly committed after the
first incident.  The sentence imposed by
the lower court was â
reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment.â
  This is erroneous as 
reclusion perpetua

is not the same as life imprisonment.  Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code mentions only 
reclusion perpetua; 
  on the other hand, life imprisonment is
imposed only as a penalty under special laws.


WHEREFORE
, finding accused-appellant Bobby
Lusa 
y 
Gervacio GUILTY
 
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
rape, he is hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua 
and
to INDEMNIFY the victim Michelle A. Lusa the sum of 
P
50,000 in
accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, plus 
P
25,000.00 for moral
damages and 
P
10,000.00 for exemplary damages.  With costs.


SO ORDERED.
