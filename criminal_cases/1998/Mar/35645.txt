PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,
VS. ROMEO MAGUAD Y NICOR, NELSON LLONOR, PETER DOE AND JOHNNY DOE, ACCUSED,
NELSON LLONOR, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




ROMERO, J.:


Stands of
sugarcane bore mute witness to the rape and subsequent killing of Josephine
Pelayo. Unfortunately for the perpetrator, they were not the only witnesses.


For the rape and
killing, Romeo Maguad, accused-appellant Nelson Llonor, and two others,
identified only as Peter Doe and Johnny Doe, were charged with the complex
crime of rape with murder and robbery, in an information filed on August 14,
1991, to wit:


âThat on or about
the 30
th
 day of July, 1991, in the City of
La Carlota, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court,
the above-named four (4) accused being then armed with knives, helped and aided
one another and by means of force and intimidation, did, then and there,
wilfully, feloniously and unlawfully have sexual intercourse in succession with
Josephine Casas Pelayo, thereafter stab(bed) the victim several times resulting
to (sic) her death and further said four (4) accused take (sic), steal (sic)
and carry (sic) away her personal belongings.


That the commission of the above
crime is attended by the aggravating circumstances of superior strength and
committed in (an) uninhabited place.


AN ACT CONTRARY TO
LAW."
[1]


Upon
arraignment, Llonor and Maguad pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.


Thereafter, the
prosecution presented Nestor Samban and Ireneo Cabuguason, two witnesses who
purportedly saw the incident, Patrolman Remegio Reloj and Dr. Edwin Jayme. 


Samban, a
thirteen-year old, recounted that at around 8:30 a.m. of July 30, 1991, he was
near the railroad at Hda. Najalin in La Carlota, herding a carabao with a
certain Lloyd Gaupo who later left when Apa, a deaf-mute, joined them. By then,
Samban had noticed three men loitering in the area. He recognized two of them
as Maguad and Llonor, who is a security guard at Hda. Najalin. A woman, whom he
recognized as Josephine Pelayo, passed by and the three men grabbed her.
Josephineâs hands and feet were held by Maguad and Llonor, respectively, while
the third man covered her mouth. The men then dragged her to the canal near the
railroad. Samban, now frightened, left but returned at around 11:00 oâclock to
retrieve a sack containing tools which he, in his haste, had left behind. This
time, he saw four persons emerge from a canefield, including Maguad, who
threatened to kill him if he revealed what he saw to anyone.


On
cross-examination, Samban admitted that as a carabao herdsman living in La
Carlota, he had to leave his residence at 3:00 a.m., riding on a truck to reach
Hda. Najalin. After the incident, he stayed with Josephineâs father, Jose, for
one month. On the night in question, he participated in the search for the
missing Josephine Pelayo, but it was only two days later, or on August 1, 1991,
that he revealed the aforementioned occurrence to Jovy Egay, Josephineâs
brother-in-law. The records reveal that Sambanâs affidavit, taken by the
police, failed to mention anything about the alleged abduction of Josephine,
but only stated that he saw Maguad at the place of the incident and that the
latter threatened to kill him.


On the other
hand, Cabuguason, a 36-year old farm laborer, testified that in the morning of
July 30, 1991, at around 9:30 a.m., he was collecting firewood at a riverbank
near Hda. Najalin when he heard a woman shout six times for help. Moving
towards the railroad, from where the shouts emanated, he noticed a field where
the sugarcane plants were moving, as if people were grappling therein. As he
approached, he saw a man, whom he recognized as Llonor, on top of a woman, whom
he likewise recognized to be Josephine Pelayo. Llonor had a knife pointed at
Josephineâs neck, his pants were lowered, and he was performing the sexual act
on her. He also heard several persons talking nearby. Like Samban, he got
scared and fled.


Patrolman Reloj
testified that on July 31, 1991, in the course of the police inquiry into
Josephineâs death, they found the victimâs cadaver in a sugarcane field, Field
No. 22, with her skirt inserted in her vagina. Her clothes, underwear, and bag
were scattered nearby. She had been stabbed fourteen times.


After considering
Sambanâs testimony, they invited Llonor for questioning. During the
investigation, Pat. Reloj saw a bloodstained knife in the possession of Llonor,
which he confiscated. The knife was subsequently found to match the punctures
found in the victimâs skirt and shorts.


Dr. Edwin Jayme,
who performed the autopsy on Josephineâs cadaver,  testified that the victim suffered fourteen stab wounds, the most
fatal being one on the chest. The stab wounds all measured about one centimeter
in width and three to four inches in length, indicating that only one weapon
was used.


In rebuttal, the
defendants raised the timeworn defense of alibi, alleging that they were
elsewhere at the time of the incident. Maguad, testifying in his own behalf,
alleged that he was harvesting rice in Hda. Alejandria, adjacent to Hda.
Najalin, when the incident occurred. He presented a co-worker to corroborate
his statement.


Likewise, Llonor
claimed that at 9:00 a.m. of July 30, 1991, he was at home in Hda. Najalin
fetching water for cooking. He heard Josephine Pelayo call his sister-in-law,
Noemi Isidoro, asking the latter to accompany her. Noemi, who was then with a
certain Grace Isidoro, however declined. He further claimed that he stayed at
his house, cooking rice and viand, until 10:00 oâclock, after which he went to
work, roving Fields 17 to 23, his security assignment, until 11:30 a.m. A
certain Cresenciano Esmedia supposedly saw him during that time. He then went
home to eat lunch, then returned to his post only at around 1:00 p.m. where he
stayed until 6:00 p.m. At 8:00 in the evening, Jovy Egay passed by and asked
him whether he had seen Josephine, who was apparently missing, to which he
replied in the negative. Thereafter, Llonor joined a search party organized by
the relatives of Josephine Pelayo, but it was their relievers who found
Josephineâs body. No other witnesses testified in Llonorâs favor.


The trial court,
in its evaluation of the evidence of the parties, gave short shrift to Sambanâs
testimony, finding that:


â(T)he testimony
of Nestor Samban however has yielded irreconciliable (sic) inconsistencies in
his declaration, grave self-contradictions in his narrations and consequential
improbabilities in his statements all on points material to the matter of the
identification of the slayers of Josephine Casas Pelayo. For instance, Nestor
Samban stated that he saw the accused and another person dragging the victim
towards the canefield. Thereafter, Maguad held her hand while accused Nelson
Llonor and another companion held her feet. He then ran home because he was
afraid. And yet according to the same witness, he returned to the place where
he saw the accused and the victim at 11:00 oâclock in the same morning only for
the purpose of retrieving the sack containing a crescent and a monkey wrench
which he left earlier after running from the scene of the crime because of
fear. The court can hardly believe such a tall tale considering his age. Normal
human instincts and the promptings of human nature dictate a reaction utterly
different from those taken by Samban.â
[2]


Likewise, the
trial court found it unbelievable that Samban, who testified that he even
joined the search for the missing Josephine, did not immediately inform the
Casas family, with whom he was then staying, of his harrowing experience. The
court similarly found it incredible that Samban would leave La Carlota at 3:00
a.m. to go to Hda. Najalin just to herd a carabao which was not even theirs.
The court 
a quo
, moreover, emphasized the glaring discrepancy between
Sambanâs testimony and his sworn affidavit.


The trial court,
however, gave full faith and credence to Ireneo Cabuguasonâs testimony
identifying Nelson Llonor as the person who sexually assaulted Josephine
Pelayo.


After trial, the
court 
a quo
 acquitted Romeo Maguad but found Llonor guilty of rape with
homicide. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:


âWHEREFORE, viewed in the light of
the preceding considerations, the court hereby renders judgment finding NELSON
LLONOR guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the Special Complex crime of âRAPE
WITH HOMICIDEâ and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA,
to pay the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P100,000.00) PESOS as damages
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. Pursuant to the
provisions of Republic Act 6127 the accused Nelson Llonor is credited in full
of the period of his detention provided he has complied with the aforesaid
provisions of the law.


For utter lack of evidence, the
court hereby pronounces the verdict of ACQUITTAL as against the accused ROMEO
MAGUAD.


SO ORDERED.â
[3]


Accused-appellant
Llonor, now appeals to this Court, questioning his conviction and the trial
courtâs award of damages.


In support of
his contentions, Llonor claims that Cabuguasonâs testimony should not have been
given faith and credence by the court. He claims that it was impossible for
Cabuguason to have identified him as the perpetrator of the crime when,
admittedly, the canes in the sugarcane field where the incident transpired were
taller than people; Cabuguason was six arm lengths away; and the latter was
admittedly frightened at the time. Furthermore, Llonor claims that it was
unnatural for Cabuguason not to have helped the victim, whom he knew, when he
was armed with a 15-inch bolo as against the 6-inch knife allegedly wielded by
Josephineâs assailant.


These
disclaimers fail to convince. Llonor was positively identified as the
perpetrator of the crime by Cabuguason, who testified:


Q
    
When
you were at around six (6) arms length were you able to see who were these
persons grappling in the canal?


A
    
I
saw a woman lying on the canal with a man on top of her.


Q
    
By
the way, did you come to know who was the one who was lying in the canal with a
man on top of her?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
Who
was she?


A
    
Mrs.
Josephine Cases (sic) Pelayo.


Q
    
This
man you said whom you saw on top of the woman lying on the canal were you able
to identify him?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
Who
was he?


A
    
Nelson
Llonor.


Q
    
What
was this Nelson Llonor do while he was on top of Josephine Casas Pelayo who was
lying on the canal?


A
    
I
saw that a man was pointing a knife at the neck of a woman.


Q
    
Aside
from pointing the knife at the neck of a woman what was the man doing on top of
a woman?


A
    
I
saw that he was making a motion of push and pull.


Q
    
This
man you identified as Nelson Llonor whom you saw on top of Josephine Casas
Pelayo pointing a knife at Josephine Casas Pelayo and whom you said you saw
doing a push and pull motion on top of Josephine Casas Pelayo, if he is here in
the courtroom will you be able to identify him?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
Please
point to this court?


A
    
There
he is (Witness pointing to the person whom when asked answered by the name of
Nelson Llonor).


Q
    
This
Nelson Llonor whom you just pointed in court whom you just mentioned you saw
doing the push and pull motion on top of Josephine Casas Pelayo, do you mean to
tell the court he was doing the sexual act?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
After
seeing Nelson Llonor on top of Josephine Casas Pelayo doing performing the
sexual act, what did you do?


A
    
I
stood up immediately.


Q
    
After
standing up immediately, what else did you see?


A
    
I
saw that one person lying on top of Josephine Casas Pelayo was Nelson Llonor
and woman was Josephine Casas Pelayo.


Q
    
When
you saw Nelson Llonor performing the sexual act on Josephine Casas Pelayo has
he pants on or not?


A
    
No
(Witness pointing the location of the pants the pants were lowered down).


Q
    
This
Nelson Llonor whom you saw on July 30, 1991 having sexual act on Josephine
Casas Pelayo prior to July 30, 1991, did you already know him?


A
    
Yes,
I know him because he was a security guard of Hda. Najalin.


Q
    
After
you stood up and see again more clearer Nelson Llonor doing the sexual act on
Josephine Casas Pelayo, what did you do?


A
    
I
moved backward.


Q
    
Why?


A
    
Because I was afraid.
[4]


Additionally,
Cabuguason categorically identified the knife confiscated from Llonor as the
same knife he saw used in intimidating the victim, 
viz
:


Q
    
You
testified earlier that you saw Nelson Llonor pointing a knife on the neck of
Josephine Casas Pelayo who was lying down on the canal, if that knife be shown
to you, can you identify the same?


A
    
Yes,
sir.


Q
    
I
am showing to you a knife around six (6) inches from tip to handle, is this the
knife which you saw being pointed by the accused Nelson Llonor on the neck of
Josephine Casas Pelayo?


A
    
Yes, sir.
[5]


The court 
a
quo
 gave full faith and credit to the above-quoted testimony and the
identification of Llonor as the malefactor. We find no reason to disturb the
same, it being axiomatic that the trial courtâs evaluation of the testimony of
a witness is generally accorded not only the highest respect, but also
finality, the lower court having had the direct opportunity to observe the
witness on the stand and to determine if he was telling the truth or not.
[6]


As to Cabuguasonâs
failure to help Josephine, this Court has consistently ruled that persons do
not necessarily react uniformly to a given situation, given that  what may be natural to one may be strange to
another.
[7]
 Unchivalrous it may have been, but
it is undeniable that Cabuguason witnessed how the crime was committed and who
committed it.


In addition, the
following pieces of circumstantial evidence point to the guilt of Llonor: he
was in possession of a knife, whose blade exactly matched the punctures on the victimâs
shorts and skirt; the victim suffered stab wounds of uniform length and width,
which stab wounds tallied with his knife; and the victim was found in Field No.
22, a sugarcane field within Llonorâs security assignment, and a mere 7 to 10
minutes away from the latterâs house.


Against this
factual backdrop, all that Llonor could offer by way of defense is an alibi.
Time and again, this Court has pronounced that for an alibi to prosper, it must
be sufficiently convincing as to preclude any doubt as to the physical
impossibility of the accused-appellantâs being present at the 
locus criminis

or its immediate vicinity at the time of the incident.
[8]
 It is an established fact that
Llonorâs house, where he purportedly was at the time the crime was committed, was
only 7 to 10 minutes away from the place of the incident; thus, it was not
physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the
time of its commission.


Furthermore, the
defense of alibi is inherently weak and cannot prevail over the positive
identification of the accused-appellant as the offender.
[9]
 As related beforehand, Cabuguason
categorically identified Llonor as the author of the crime, rendering the
latterâs alibi and denial worthless.


Likewise, Llonor
failed to present Noemi and Grace Isidoro, the persons allegedly at his house
at 9:30 of that fateful day, to corroborate his alibi. Neither did Crescenciano
Esmedia, whom he claimed saw him on July 30, 1991 at his post, testify in his
behalf.


In fine, we hold
that the evidence presented by the prosecution establishes beyond reasonable
doubt that Llonor perpetrated the crime charged.


As to the award
of damages, we find that the trial court correctly awarded 
P
100,000.00
as damages, 
P
50,000.00 being indemnity for death, in accordance with
current jurisprudence, and 
P
50,000.00 as moral damages suffered for the
physical suffering, mental anguish, serious anxiety, moral shock, and social
humiliation caused by the manner by which the victim was raped and killed.
Having been found guilty of the crime charged, he is liable for damages caused
by his wrongful act.
[10]


Finally, while
the prosecution charged Llonor with ârape with murder and robbery,â the trial
court correctly found him guilty of the special complex crime of rape with
homicide, there being no such crime as ârape with murder and robbery.â In the
words of the trial court:


â(T)his case is
wrongly denominated, without the defense having objected to the imperfection of
the information. Following the doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court in the
case of 
People vs. Flores
, 195 SCRA 295, the crime charged is a Special
Complex crime of Rape with Homicide. This is so because the commission of the
crime of robbery which should appropriately be designated as theft, was only as
an afterthought, as the accused was primordially impelled by an intent to
commit a crime against chastity rather than against property.â
[11]


The penalty
imposable for rape with homicide is death, which, in view of its suspension by
the Constitution at the time of the commission of the crime under review, could
not be decreed by the trial court. The court 
a quo
, thus, correctly
imposed the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
. 


WHEREFORE
, the appeal is 
DISMISSED
 and
the decision of the trial court finding accused-appellant Nelson Llonor guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape with homicide is hereby 
AFFIRMED
.
Costs against accused-appellant.
