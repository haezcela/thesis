PANGANIBAN, J.:


Conspiracy
and/or direct participation in a crime may be proven by circumstantial
evidence.  However, the comprising
circumstances must be duly proven, consistent with each other and lead with
moral certainty to only one conclusion: that the accused is guilty.  If the totality of such circumstances
eliminates beyond reasonable doubt the possibility of innocence, conviction is
proper; otherwise, the accused must be acquitted.  If said accused, however, took advantage of the effects of the
crime and profited thereby, he can be held criminally liable as an accessory.


The Case


This is an
appeal from the March 18, 1994 Decision
[1]
 of the Regional Trial Court of
Lianga, Surigao del Sur, Branch 28, in Criminal Case No. L-1174, convicting
Raul Mondaga, Rodrigo Legarto and Daniel Maluenda of kidnapping and sentencing
them to 
reclusiÃ³n perpetua.


In an
Information dated November 20, 1992, Mondaga, Maluenda and Legarto, together
with a certain Gil Bueno, were charged by Prosecutor II  Florito G. Cuartero with kidnapping,
committed as follows:
[2]


âThat on
the 19
th
 day of August 1992, at about 9:00
oâclock in the evening, more or less, at [B]arangay Diatagon, [M]unicipality of
Lianga, [P]rovince of Surigao del Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and
mutually helping one another, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously kidnap Engr. Miguel Resus for the purpose of extorting money from
Engr. & Mrs. Resus, and detaining said Engr. Miguel Resus for a period of
four (4) days, to the damage and prejudice of the victim in the amount of 
P
200,000.00,
Philippine Currency.


CONTRARY TO LAW.  (In violation of Article 267 of the Revised
Penal Code).â


Warrants of
arrest for the four accused were issued by the trial court, but Bueno eluded
the authorities and remained at large.
[3]
 At their arraignment and with the
assistance of counsel, Legarto, Maluenda and Mondaga pleaded not guilty.
[4]


After trial in
due course, the lower court found the three accused guilty as charged and
disposed as follows:
[5]


âWHEREFORE, consistent with
all the foregoing findings, this Court finds all the accuseds [sic], namely,
Raul Mondaga, alias Bobong Gonzaga, 21 years old, single, driver by occupation,
as alleged, and resident of Tagongon, Tagbina, Surigao del Sur; Rodrigo Legarto
alias Rudy, 37 years old, married to Magdalena C. Legarto, gas man of the
bankrupt Lianga Bay Logging Co., Inc. and a resident of New Highway, Purok III,
Diatagon, Lianga, Surigao del Sur and Daniel Maluenda, Alias Commander Dongkoy,
22 years old, single, and a farmer and goldminer, and resident of Purok 1,
Barobo, Surigao del Sur, all guilty beyond reasonable doubt as co-principals of
the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom, defined and penalized under the last
paragraph of Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code as charged in the
Information, and are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion
perpetua
, with all the accessory penalties provided by law, and to restitute
to the private complainants, Engr. Miguel E. Resus and Dra. Bernardita R.
Resus, jointly and severally, the amount of 
P
200,000.00 corresponding to
the aggregate of the money in cash and medicines extorted as per the demand of
the accuseds [sic] and given by the kidnap victimâs wife, including the subject
motorcycle which has been paid for by the victimâs ransom money; (Exh. âEâ)
with the down payment as per agreement advanced by the couple Resus for a total
cost price of 
P
46,895.00 (Exh. âFâ) and to pay the costs.


Immediately after
promulgation of this decision, so as not to render the sentence imposed
ineffectual with respect to accused Rodrigo Legarto, alias Rudy, the bail bond
posted for his provisional release is hereby cancelled and said accused ordered
committed to the custody of the Provincial Warden of Surigao del Sur at Tandag,
Surigao del Sur, preparatory to the service of his sentence.


In the service of this
sentence, all the accused are ordered immediately turned over to the custody of
the Director, Bureau of Corrections, at Muntinlupa, Metro Manila, pursuant to
the mandate of Supreme Court Circular No. 4-92-A dated April 20, 1992.

their possible execution and return, and hereby consigning this case, with
respect to said GIL BUENO, to the ARCHIVES to be reinstated to the active files
of criminal cases upon his arrest.â


In view of the
penalty imposed, Legarto, Maluenda and Mondaga interposed this appeal directly
before this Court.
[6]
 However, on March 30, 1995, Mondaga
withdrew his appeal.
[7]
 Hence, this Court will now pass
upon the criminal liability of Legarto and Maluenda only.


The Facts 
Version of the Prosecution


In the
Appelleeâs Brief, the solicitor general presents the following narration of the
kidnapping:
[8]
 


âOn August 19, 1992 at
around 9:45 in the evening, Engr. Miguel E. Resus  (âEngr. Resusâ) and his wife, Dr. Bernardita B. Resus (âDr.
Resusâ), arrived at their residence/clinic at Diatagon, Lianga, Surigao del
Sur, from a novena they attended.  Waiting for the Resus spouses at the clinic which adjoins the Resus
spousesâ residence were three men who identified themselves as Commander Bobong
Gonzaga (who is actually Raul Mondaga), Commander Bongkoy (who is actually
Maluenda) and alias âAlexâ.  Upon the
arrival of the Resus spouses, Mondaga declared that they came upon orders of a
certain Father Simon, an alleged NPA Commander, with his directive to solicit
money and medicines needed for the victims of the recent military-NPA encounter
at Melale, Agusan del Sur.  The trio
demanded from the couple medicines and money in the amount of 
P
20,000.00,
but when the couple told them that they did not have such an amount, they
lowered their demand to 
P
10,000.00, and reduced it still to 
P
5,000.00
when the couple still could not produce the said amount.  Finally, the demand was lowered to any amount
the Resus couple could provide.  The
latter gave the amount of 
P
500.00 plus assorted medicines worth 
P
800.00.  After they were given the money and
medicines, the trio demanded that they be driven by Engr. Resus in his
Volkswagen car to San Roque, Barobo, Surigao del Sur, but the couple begged off
reasoning that their car [did] have any sufficient gasoline and that the car
was not in good running condition to travel that night.  Mondaga then demanded that very early in the
morning, the couple should prepare the vehicle so Engr. Resus [could] drive
them to San Roque, Barobo, Surigao del Sur.  They left the clinic with [a] threat not to tell anybody about their
coming, otherwise they [would] kill all the members of their family and blow-up
the clinic.


The next day or on August
20, 1992 at around 5:00 oâclock in the morning, Mondaga arrived at the
residence of the Resus couple.  Mondaga
hurried up Engr. Resus as he [would] meet his companions who were ferried by
Legarto.  Engr. Resus then drove Mondaga
to Andanan.  As the two passed along
Andanan, they met Legarto, who was on his way back to Diatogon after his
passengers, i.e., Maluenda and Alex, alighted from his motorcycle and
[waited]  for Mondaga and Engr. Resus at
Andanan.  Maluenda and Alex then rode
with Mondaga and Engr. Resus to Barobo.  Upon reaching Barobo, Mondaga told Engr. Resus that they [would] go to
San Francisco instead of going to San Roque.  They, however, did not reach San Francisco, and instead they stopped at
Alegria.  Upon reaching Alegria, Mondaga
ordered Engr. Resus that he had to go with them.  Against his will, Engr. Resus went with the three.  They went to the mountain hiking for almost
two (2) hours between the boundary of Cardon and Alegria.  Upon reaching a hut, Mondaga told him that
he had forgotten something and had to go back and that Engr. Resus had to stay
there.  So Engr. Resus, Maluenda, Alex
and Gil Bueno passed the night in the farmhut.


Meanwhile at the house of
the Resus couple, Dr. Resus was informed by the midwife that Mondaga came at
around 4:00 p.m. when Dr. Resus was out.  Mondaga told the midwife that he [would] come back.  Mondaga arrived at the Resus clinic at
around 7:00 in the evening.  Mondaga
demanded from Dr. Resus the amount of 
P
300,000.00 for the release of Engr.
Resus.  Dr. Resus told Mondaga that she
[could] only produce 
P
10,000.00.  Mondaga told Dr. Resus to reserve the amount for he [would] get it the
following morning.  He also instructed
Dr. Resus to look for the firearm of her husband.  Dr. Resus then searched for the gun (Exh. H) of her husband and
after finding it in the cabinet in their room, gave the same to Mondaga.  After [the gun was given to him], Mondaga
demanded for the use of Engr. Resusâ motorcycle, but Dr. Resus told him that
the motorcycle [was] out of order.  So
Mondaga instructed Dr. Resus to get the motorcycle of Legarto, which Dr. Resus
did.


On August 21, 1992, at
around 4:45 a.m. Mondaga arrived at Dr. Resusâ clinic.  Shortly thereafter, Legarto also arrived in
his motorcycle.  Mondaga demanded that
Dr. Resus go with them but the latter made excuses particularly her
health.  Dr. Resus asked that her helper
Maria Abne go instead to which Mondaga agreed.  At exactly 5:00 a.m., Mondaga, Legarto and Maria Abne left Dr. Resusâ
clinic, bringing with them the 
P
10,000.00 Dr. Resus gave and the Magnum
22 of Engr. Resus.  The three arrived at
Alegria, San Francisco, Agusan del Sur at around 7:00 a.m.  Legarto then safely kept his motorcycle
after which they walked to the forest for about 2 hours until they reached a
carabao crossing where Mondaga left Legarto and Maria Abne for 30 minutes.  Mondaga went to the hut where he left Engr.
Resus with a note from Dr. Resus which state[d], âDaddy, I have committed only 
P
10,000.00â.  He gave the note to Engr. Resus but told
Engr. Resus that âyou can afford 
P
300,000.00â.  Engr. Resus pleaded with Mondaga that they [did] not have such
amount so Mondaga lowered his demand to 
P
200,000.00.  Engr. Resus then signed the note stating,
âMommy, it is up to you to produce this amount.â  With the note, Mondaga and Legarto went back to Alegria, while
Abne was left with Engr. Resus.  Legarto
who was driving Engr. Resusâ car, went to the house of Nora Gubantes where Dr.
Resus was at that time and informed her that Mondaga [was] waiting [for] her at
SSIFA, St. Christine.  Dr. Resus went
with Legarto at SSIFA, St. Christine where they met Mondaga, who joined them at
the car after which the three proceeded to a deserted place.  Mondaga then handed to Dr. Resus the note
written by Engr. Resus where it was written the 
P
200,000.00 ransom.
[sic]  Dr. Resus told Mondaga that she
[could] only produce 
P
100,000.00  Mondaga agreed to the 
P
100,000.00 on the additional condition
that he [would] no longer return the motorcycle of Legarto and instead to give
to Legarto the amount of 
P
50,000.00 as payment for the motorcycle.  Mondaga also instructed Legarto to deliver
the amount of 
P
100,000.00 and the original license of the
motorcycle.  Dr. Resus and Legarto then
went back to the clinic leaving Mondaga behind.


At around 1:30 p.m. of
August 21, 1992, Dr. Resus, together with Nora Gubantes, went to Lianga to
secure money from the relatives of Dr. Resus.  Since Dr. Resusâ cousins were out of town, the two proceeded to San Francisco,
Agusan del Sur to see Dr. Presentacion Manatad, the mayor of San
Francisco.  Dr. Resus informed Mayor
Manatad about the incident and asked the mayor to give her an amount of 
P
150,000.00
in return for a PNB Check Dr. Resus [would] issue.  Mayor Manatad gave her the amount after Dr. Resus issued PNB
Check No. 621330-AJ in the amount of 
P
150,000.00 (Exh. B).  Dr. Resus gave the money to Nora Gubantes
with the instruction to give the same to Legarto.  Upon reaching Diatogon, Nora Gubantes gave the money to her husband
with the instruction to give the money to Legarto.  Legarto acknowledged receiving the money from Mr. Gubantes on
August 22, 1992.


On August 22, 1992, Mondaga
arrived at the hut where Engr. Resus was and told that [sic] the latter that he
would be released but that he [would] come back to get the balance of the 
P
300,000.00
in three months.  In the afternoon of
August 22, 1992, Engr. Resus and Maria Abne were released.  The two were driven by Legarto in Engr.
Resus[â] car.


Mondaga, Maluenda and
Legarto were later arrested by the police.â


Version of the Defense


Appellant
Legarto, the Resus coupleâs former part-time driver, denies any criminal
involvement in the kidnapping.  He avows
that he participated only in the delivery of the ransom money at the insistence
of Dr. Resus herself.  In Legartoâs
Supplemental Brief, his counsel submits the following counter-statement of
facts:
[9]


âOn August 19, 1992, at
9:45 in the evening, Engr. Miguel E. Resus and wife Dr. Bernardita B. Resus,
arrived at their clinic near their residence at Diatagon, Lianga, Surigao del
Sur after attending a novena.  (TSN,
March 16, 1993, p. 3).  There were three
(3) men who were waiting for them at the clinic, later identified as Commander
Bobong Gonzaga (Raul Mondaga), Commander Bongkoy (Daniel Maluenda), and a
certain âAlexâ (
ibid..
 p. 5).  Mondaga, upon arrival of the spouses, solicited money and medicines from
them, upon orders of a certain Father Simon, an NPA Commander (
ibid..
 p.
7).  These money and medicines were
needed for the victims of the recent military-NPA encounter at Melale, Agusan
del Sur.  (
ibid..
).  At first, the three asked for 
P
20,000.00
(
ibid..
 p. 8) but lowered it to 
P
10,000.00, and still reduced it
to 
P
5,000.00.  Finally, the Resus
spouses could only give 
P
500.00 together with P800.00 worth of
medicines.  (TSN, March 17, 1993 p. 42).


After the money and
medicines were handed to them, the three people demanded that they be driven by
Engr. Resus in his Volkswagen car to San Roque, Barobo, Surigao del Sur, but
Engr. Resus declined saying that he could not drive them at 12:00 midnight
because he [did] not have enough gasoline and that his service car [was] not in
good condition to travel in the evening.  (TSN, March 16, 1993, p. 8).  But
one person, Mondaga, insisted that the next morning, a vehicle should be
prepared for a trip to San Roque, Barobo, Surigao del Sur. (TSN, March 17,
1993, p. 43)


At about 4:45 in the
morning of August 20, 1992, Mondaga knocked at the door of the clinic.  Engr. Resus was just busy preparing the
vehicle, securing gasoline. (
ibid.
, p. 44.)  Mondaga rode in the vehicle of Engr. Resus and met his two
companions at Andanan. (
ibid..
)


Instead of San Roque, the
vehicle stopped at Alegria (TSN, March 16, 1993, p. 11).  The three (Mondaga, Maluenda and Alex) asked
Engr. Resus to go with them.  (
ibid..
)  They went to the mountains and hiked for
almost two (2) hours between the boundary of Gordon and Alegria. (
ibid..
)  When they reached the area, Mondaga went
back to Alegria, leaving behind the three who passed the night in the
area.  (
ibid.
, p. 12)


Mondaga arrived at around
4:00 in the afternoon at the clinic of Dr. Resus.  (TSN, March 17, 1993, p. 47)  Dr. Resus was out, but when Mondaga later came back at 7:00 in the evening
and saw Dr. Resus (
ibid.
, p. 48), he demanded the amount of 
P
300,000.00.  But since Dr. Resus had only 
P
10,000.00,
Mondaga told her to reserve it and he [would] get it the next morning.  (
ibid..
, pp. 48-49)  After asking for the firearm of Engr. Resus,
(
ibid.
, p. 51) Mondaga demanded to use the motorcycle of Engr. Resus. (
ibid..
)  Dr. Resus said that it was out of order. (
ibid..
)  Mondaga ordered her to secure a motorcycle.
(
ibid.
) Dr. Resus, together with her maid, Maria Abne, went to the house
of their driver, Rudy Legarto. (TSN, November 23, 1993, p. 22)  Dr. Resus requested Rudy Legarto to drive
for Maria Abne and Mondaga in his motorcycle to Alegria and on his return, to
drive for his Manong Mike. (
ibid.
)  Legarto refused because of his work.  (
ibid.
)  But when Dr.
Resus insisted and when told that it was very important to conduct Maria Abne
and Mondaga, and because she was his boss, he agreed. (
ibid..
)  He was asked to file a leave of absence from
his job. (
ibid..
)  It is
important to note that it was [Dr.] Resus who got Legarto involved in this
drama.


At around 5:00 in the
morning of August 21, 1992, Legarto drove for Maria Abne and Mondaga to Alegria
at the behest of Dr. Resus. (
ibid.
, p. 23)  At Alegria, the three proceeded of [sic] Dr. Resus (
ibid.
,
p. 23) to a hilly side.   (
ibid..
)
Legarto and Maria Abne were left behind and Mondaga told them that he [would]
inform his commander to release Engr. Resus. (
ibid..
)  They were also warned not to escape because
they were guarded.  (
ibid..
)


At about 9:00 in the
evening, Engr. Resus, together with Mondaga, arrived.  Legarto was told by Engr. Resus not to worry as he was treated
well.  (
ibid..
) Engr. Resus told
Mondaga that Legarto was his driver and Maria Abne was his helper. (
ibid..
)  [O]n the way back, Legarto and Abne walked
five (5) meters ahead while Mondaga and Engr. Resus walked side by side.  Legarto and Abne heard their conversations (
ibid.
,
pp. 23-24) and Mondaga was demanding 
P
300,000.00. Engr. Resus pleaded
that he [did not] have that amount. (
ibid.
)  Mondaga them ordered Engr. Resus to make a note to his wife, Dr.
Resus stating that 
P
300,000.00 be given. (
ibid.
)  After the note was signed, Mondaga got the
keys of the Volkswagen car and the motorcycle while Legarto was brought along
to Alegria.  (
ibid.
, p. 25)  Engr. Resus and Maria Abne were left
behind.  (
ibid.
)  When they arrived at Alegria, Mondaga
ordered him to drive the Volkswagen in going back to Diatagon while Mondaga
drove the motorcycle of Legarto. (
ibid..
)


However, at Diatagon,
Mondaga stopped Legarto near the School of Fisheries. (
ibid..
)  He was ordered to fetch Dr. Resus and bring
her to Mondaga for final negotiation. (
ibid..
)  There was a threat not to disseminate the information because if
he [did], then Legartoâs family [would] be killed, including himself. (
ibid..
)


He was able to find Dr.
Resus at the house of a certain Nora Gubantes and told her he was ordered to
fetch her.  Legarto asked Dr. Resus what
[was] this incident about and Legarto was told immediately to shut up.  (
ibid.
, p. 26)  Legarto asked her of her decision but was
told to shut up again. (
ibid..
)


Dr. Resus rode with him in
the Volkswagen car towards the area near the Fisheries School at St. Catherine,
Lianga, Surigao del Sur. (
ibid..
)  At some point Mondaga joined them in the car.  Dr. Resus allowed Mondaga to sit at the back while she sat in
front seat beside Legarto. They talked about the money, and Dr. Resus
pleaded  that she [could] only produce 
P
100,000.00.
(
ibid.
, p. 27) Mondaga agreed, provided the motorcycle of Legarto be
included. (
ibid..
)  Legarto, at
this point, intervened and told Dr. Resus not to include in the negotiation his
motorcycle because the installment was not yet fully paid.  (
ibid..
)  Dr. Resus then told him to âjust give his motorcycle.â (
ibid..
)  Then, Mondaga told Dr. Resus that Legarto
would be the one who [would] bring the money to Alegria.  He agreed again because Dr. Resus was his
boss. (
ibid..
)


On August 22, 1992, at 4:00
in the afternoon, Eslao Gubantes and his son delivered 
P
136,000.00 to
Legarto plus 
P
200.00 for gasoline (
ibid.
, p. 28).  The 
P
36,000.00 [was] to be paid as
partial payment for his motorcycle. (
ibid.
)


When he filed his leave of
his [sic] absence, he talked to his Superintendent Virgilio Fernandez and
others who told him he should have filed his leave of absence ahead because
nobody was detailed at the depot, (
ibid.
, p. 29) but he told them that,
there was an emergency because Engr. Resus was held hostage and he [would]
deliver the money. (
ibid..
)


On his way to Alegria, he
met Dr. Resus together with her nephew riding a police car (
ibid.
).  He was asked by Dra. Resus where the money
[was] but he answered, he brought along with him 
P
100,000.00.  (
ibid..
)  Dr. Resus told him to bring also the 
P
36,000.00 and
another 
P
14,000.00 which was about to be given by Dr. Resus. (
ibid..
)  However, he advised Dr.  Resus that he would bring only 
P
100,000.00
because that was what they [had] agreed upon. (
ibid.
)  If Mondaga objects [sic] he [would] just
come back. (
ibid..
)  This was confirmed
by Dr. Resusâ nephew (
ibid..
)


Legarto proceeded to
Alegria and subsequently delivered the money to Mondaga, which resulted [in]
the release of Engr. Resus, together with Maria Abne.  (
ibid.
, p. 30) Engr. Resus and Maria Abne were brought
back to Lianga, where they met Dr. Resus.  Mayor Layno of Lianga commented that if not for your driver and Maria
Abne, Engr. Resus [would] not be rescued. (
ibid..
) Engr. Resus and Dr.
Resus remained at Lianga, while he and Maria Abne proceeded to Diatagon. (
ibid..
)


On September 18, 1992,
Legarto and Maria Abne were brought to the municipal building to act as
witnesses for Engr. and Dr. Resus. (
ibid.
, p. 31)  However, after executing his affidavit
before the Municipal Judge, he was arrested just when he went out from the
office (
ibid.
, p. 31).  He was
brought to Patin-ay, Agusan del Sur, where he was detained.  (
ibid.
, p. 32) While there, he wrote
a letter to Engr. and Dr. Resus for help.  (
ibid..
) The letter expressed his sentiment and dismay that in
spite of his help, he was included in the case. (
ibid.
, p. 33)  He denied having driven Mondaga alias Bobong
Gonzaga at any other time.â


Similarly,
Maluenda denies knowledge of Mondagaâs plan to commit the said crime.  He accompanied the latter to Mahilom only to
mine for gold and not to plan, much less commit, any crime.  He alleges that he guarded the victim at the
hut only because Mondaga threatened to kill him and his family.  Through counsel, Maluenda presents his own
version of the facts, as follows:
[10]
 


âDaniel Maluenda testified
that on August 20, 1992 at around 10:00 oâclock in the evening, he was in his
house at Barobo when Raul Mondaga came over.  Mondaga told him that he [had] a tunnel in Mahilom and offered Maluenda
a fifty-fifty proposition to gold mine the tunnel.  Maluenda, who [was] a farmer and at the same time a gold miner,
agreed to the proposition.


On August 21, 1992 at
around 7:00 oâclock in the morning, Maluenda together with Mondaga proceeded to
Sitio Mahilom.  Upon reaching Garden,
Tambis, Surigao del Sur, Mondaga tried to give Maluenda a pistol and grenade
but Maluenda questioned Mondagaâs purpose for bringing the same since they were
just looking for gold inside the tunnel.  Mondaga in turn told Maluenda to just follow what he [ordered] so that
nothing will happen to him, and that Mondaga [would] not hesitate to kill a
person, so Maluenda merely followed Mondaga as he was afraid.


Arriving at Mahilom,
Mondaga and Maluenda proceeded to a hut where the latter saw Engr. Resus and
some other persons.  Mondaga ordered
Maluenda to stay in the hut and feed these persons.  Maluenda in turn retorted that their agreement was to mine for
gold, but Mondaga told him âto just follow my order so that nothing will happen
to you, or else I will blast your head and kill your family.â  Inside the hut, Maluenda and Engr. Resus
talked and planned to escape.


The next day at around 2:00
in the afternoon, Maluenda, together with Engr. Resus, left but when they
reached Alegria, they met Mondaga.  Mondaga approached Engr. Resus, held his hand and said, do not be afraid
because you can go home.  Mondaga also
told Maluenda not to report the matter to the authorities otherwise, they
[would] all be killed.


Maluenda denied that he was
at the clinic of Dra. Resus on August 19, 1992.  Furthermore, he denied having received any money from
Mondaga.  (TSN, November 24, 1993, pp.
50-59)â


Ruling of the Trial Court


The trial court
convicted Legarto, Maluenda and Mondaga, holding that they successfully
perpetrated a clear case of kidnapping.  It gave complete credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses
whom it deemed unquestionably reliable, sincere and candid.  The lower court held that Mondaga was the
mastermind of the kidnapping.  While
Appellant Legarto portrayed himself as a good Samaritan to the Resus couple,
the trial court stated that he was a wolf in sheepâs clothing and described his
testimony as evasive, false and shallow.


The court 
a
quo
 held: â[A]s to how accused Raul Mondaga came to know that the Resus
couple could pay ransom, the finger of suspicion points to Legarto as source.â
[11]
 Legarto failed to satisfactorily
explain why he did not testify against Mondaga in the criminal case for
carnapping involving his motorcycle.  His actuations from the outset until the time he delivered the ransom
money betrayed his active participation as a co-principal by indispensable
cooperation in the crime.  Of the 
P
136,000
handed to him for delivery to the kidnappers, Legarto kept 
P
36,000 for
himself.  Legarto confidently refused to
accept 
P
14,000 more from Dr. Resus, saying that what he had  was already sufficient.  He further failed to report the incident to
the police when he had the opportunity to do so.


The trial court
also noted the following pieces of evidence which proved Legartoâs participation
in the crime: 


1.  Witness
Sanchez testified that she saw Mondaga frequenting Legartoâs house in Diatagon,
and she even saw him and Mondaga riding on his motorcycle.  


2.  On August 20,
1992, Engineer Resus saw him convey Maluenda and âAlexâ to Andanan, where
Maluenda and âAlexâ boarded Engineer  Resusâs car.  


3.  He drove the victimâs car back to Diatagon from Alegria.  


4.  He delivered Mondagaâs ransom notes to Dr. Resus. 


5.  He also delivered the ransom money to the kidnappers.  


6.  He used 
P
36,000 of the ransom money to pay the balance of the
purchase price of his motorcycle.


All these
allegedly show Legartoâs participation as a co-principal by indispensable
cooperation in the crime.


Through the same
witnesses for the prosecution, Maluenda, who introduced  himself as Commander Dongkoy,  was  positively identified as one of the men who went to Dr. Resusâ clinic on
August 19, 1992.  The kidnap victim also
identified him as the guard at the hideout in Alegria.  Hence, the trial court convicted him as a
co-principal.


Assignment of Errors


Legarto assigns
the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:
[12]


âI-
     
The lower court erred in finding that, âas
to how accused Raul Mondaga came to know that the Resus couple could pay
ransom, the finger of suspicion points to Legarto, as sourceâ.


II-  
    
The
lower court erred in giving credence to the testimony of Norma Sanchez.


III-
     
The lower court erred in finding that,
âwith respect to accused Rodrigo Legarto, there were several instances noted by
the court which lead [sic] it to conclude that this particular accused was part
of the criminal scheme to commits [sic] said kidnapping.â


IV-
    
The lower court erred in holding, âthat he
has all the opportunity to report such criminal scheme to the police or
military authorities, if he wanted to and his failure to do so plainly
indicated his part in the criminal plan; and his actuations from the outset in
a criminal plan was put to an [sic] effect, up to his rule [sic] in hand
carrying the ransom money which he turned over to Mondaga at the mountain
hideout which he know [sic] inevitably, shows his active participation as a
co-principal by [indispensable] cooperation.


V-
     
The lower court erred in not giving
credence to the testimony of Rodrigo Legarto.


VI-
    
The lower court erred in convicting the
accused-appellant as co-principal of the crime of kidnapping for ransom defined
and penalized under the last par. of Art. 267 of the Revised Penal Code as charged
in the information and [in sentencing him] to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion
perpetua
, with all the accessory penalties provided by law.


VII-
   
The lower court erred in ordering the
confiscation of appellantâs motorcycle.â


In the
Supplemental Brief, Legartoâs other counsel adds the following issues:
[13]


âI.
     
The participation of Legarto was not proven
beyond reasonable doubt.


II.
      
Legarto was convicted on mere suspicion of
one prosecution witness.


III.
     
Legarto [had] no motive in kidnapping Engr.
Resus.


IV.
    
Lower court erred in holding that Legarto
[was] a co-principal by indispensable cooperation.


V.
     
The lower court erred in ordering the
confiscation of the motorcycle of Legarto.â


For his part,
Maluenda submits the following as his lone assignment of error:
[14]


âThe trial court erred in
finding the accused guilty of the crime charged despite the fact that his guilt
was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.â


For clarity and
order, the Court will separately discuss the participation of the appellants,
and the probative value of the evidence presented against each of them.


The Courtâs Ruling


The appeal is
partially meritorious as regards Legarto who, in the light of the evidence
presented, should be held liable only as an accessory.  In contrast, Maluendaâs conviction deserves
affirmation, as his culpability in the kidnapping was clearly proven.


Legartoâs Culpability


Sufficiency of
Circumstantial Evidence


The solicitor
general argues for the affirmation of Legartoâs conviction on the ground that
the trial courtâs assessment of the credibility of the prosecution witnesses is
generally accorded great respect on appeal.  However, the Court believes that the resolution of this appeal
transcends the issue of the credibility of the witnesses.  There is need to evaluate the sufficiency of
the circumstantial evidence presented to sustain Legartoâs conviction.


The trial court
found Legarto guilty as a principal by indispensable cooperation on the basis
of several pieces of 
circumstantial evidence,
 which the solicitor
general depicts as clearly demonstrating his participation.  On the other hand, Legarto asserts that the
same set of evidence is frail and inconclusive.


Legartoâs
contention merits consideration.  A
principal by indispensable cooperation is defined by Article 17 of the Revised
Penal Code thus:


âART. 17. 
Principals. â 
The
following are considered principals:


x x x
 
x x x
   
x
x x


3.
     
Those who cooperate in the commission of the offense by another
act without which it would not have been accomplished.â


Legarto cannot
be convicted under this definition because the prosecution failed to allege,
much less prove, any overt act on his part showing direct participation in the
kidnapping itself, his participation in the incident being limited to acts
committed after the abduction was already consummated.  He was not with the kidnappers (1) when they
forcibly solicited money and medicine from the Resus couple, (2) when they
brought the kidnap victim to Alegria, and (3) when Mondaga demanded ransom for the
victimâs release.  Together with the
Resusâ housemaid, he accompanied Mondaga to the hideout in Alegria only upon
Dr. Resusâ request.  In short, the
prosecution failed to piece together a clear story as to how Legarto figured in
the kidnapping caper.


Admittedly,
circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to convict an accused as a principal
by indispensable cooperation in accordance with Sec. 4, Rule 133 of the Rules
of Court.
[15]
 It may also show conspiracy.  Thus, this Court meticulously examined the
pleadings, the records and the assailed Decision, in order to evaluate the
sufficiency of Legartoâs conviction.  The pieces of circumstantial evidence used by the prosecution and
accepted by the trial court are enumerated and evaluated 
seriatim
.


Acquaintance Is
Inconclusive Proof of Participation


That Mondaga frequented the house of Legarto in Diatagon proves that he
knew the latter.  Witness Sanchez
testified that she even saw them riding  Legartoâs  motorcycle  during  the  town  fiesta  on June 24, 1992.  However, this
event occurred about two months before the kidnapping on August 19 to 22,
1992.  Considering that the prosecution
did not present any evidence to show that the plan to kidnap Engineer Resus was
hatched as early as June 24, 1992, the fact that Legarto and Mondaga were
together during the town fiesta should not be considered as proof of Legartoâs
direct participation in the crime.  Likewise, that Legarto was acquainted with Mondaga does not prove that
the former had a hand in the kidnapping.


Conveying
Maluenda and Bueno Does Not Conclusively Prove Participation


The solicitor
general harps on the fact that, on August 20, 1992,  Legarto was seen transporting Maluenda and âAlexâ to Andanan on
his motorcycle.  He claims that this is
strong proof of Legartoâs complicity, as it shows that Legarto had knowledge of
the plan to kidnap Engineer Resus.  The
trial court, for its part, said that this fact âpoints to the clear perception
that xxx he was part of the dubious criminal plan.â  The âfactâ relied upon by the solicitor general and the trial
court, however, is a mere speculation.  This is clear from Engineer Resusâ testimony, the pertinent portion of
which is reproduced below:
[16]


âQ
   
On
the following day, August 20, 1992, where were you?


A

While
you were in your residence, what transpired, if there was any?


A

got ready of [sic] my car, at the same time Raul Mondaga came in, sir.


Q
    
What
time did Raul Mondaga enter your residence?


A
    
At
about 5:00 oâclock early in the morning, sir.

Now,
while you were preparing your car, what happened next?


A
    
I
parked my car infront [sic] of the clinic, sir.


Q
    
Then
what happened next after parking your car infront [sic] of your clinic?


A
    
Raul
Mondaga hurried me up to go with his companion who was ferried by Rudy Legarto,
sir.


x x x
                        
x x x
                            
x x x


Q
    
When
you arrived at Andanan, what happened?


A
    
As
we passed along Andanan, I met Rudy Legarto on the way going back to Diatagon,
with his two (2) passengers already alighted from his motorcycle and waiting
for us at Andanan and then took a ride with us on our way to Barobo, sir.
â
(Underscoring supplied.)


Engineer Resus
merely said that he saw Legarto heading back to Diatagon.  He did not witness Maluenda and âAlexâ on
board Legartoâs motorcycle or alighting therefrom; he only saw the two at
Andanan waiting for Mondaga and him.  In
fact, Engineer Resus did not actually see Legarto transport Mondagaâs
companions.  Hence, the statement that
Legarto did so is a conclusion unsupported by Resusâ testimony, a mere
speculation of the event that 
might
 have preceded what Engineer Resus
saw.  Its true nature as a conjecture is
evident from the averment of the trial court that âxxx they were conveyed there
by Rodrigo Legarto with the use of his motorcycle, as he was even encountered
on the road on his return back to Diatagon that morning by Engr. Resus.â


From the
foregoing, it is clear that Legartoâs alleged direct participation in the
kidnapping is without factual basis;  it
is nothing more than an inference drawn from a presumption.  And because circumstantial evidence not
adequately established cannot become the basis of conviction, such inference
cannot be given evidentiary weight to support Legartoâs conviction as a
principal by indispensable cooperation.
[17]


No Specific
Demand for Legartoâs Motorcycle


The solicitor
general avers that Mondagaâs instruction to Dr. Resus to requisition Legartoâs
motorcycle proves Legartoâs complicity in the felonious scheme.  The averment is inaccurate because Mondaga,
in accordance with Dr. Resusâ testimony, had originally requisitioned the
victimâs motorcycle, but the latter told him that it was out of order.
[18]
 So, Mondaga asked for Legartoâs
motorcycle instead.


That Mondaga
chose Legartoâs motorcycle when he could have demanded any other two-wheel
vehicle can be explained by the fact that, several times prior to the
kidnapping, he had taken a ride on the said motorcycle.  Note that Legarto used the motorcycle as a
vehicle for hire in the area.


Delivering the Ransom Money and Keeping Part of It


Do Not Prove
Conspiracy


The solicitor
general avers that the complete trust of Mondaga in Legarto, whom the former
designated as collector of the ransom money, proves the latterâs
participation.  The trial court, on the
same point, said:
[19]


âxxx His subsequent direct
involvement in the negotiations with Dra. Resus when he was made to drive the
Volkswagen car to Diatagon, contact Dra. Resus in the final negotiations, and
delivery of the ransom money agreed upon [sic] to Raul Mondaga, admitting
having withheld at his house a part of the ransom money amounting to 
P
36,000.00(?)
and paying off the balance of the motorcycle with it, as evidenced by the
receipt of payment, demonstrates very strongly and beyond doubt to [sic] his
participation in that criminal act, as now charged.  xxxx.â


These averments,
however, are sufficiently rebutted by Legartoâs allegation that, out of loyalty
to his former boss, he participated in the release of the kidnap victim, not in
his detention. The testimony of Engineer Resus -- that Legarto was at Alegria
in order to fetch  the  former -- is cited by the defense as
follows:
[20]


âQ
   
Do
you confirm x x x the statements in these affidavits which you subscribed and
sworn [sic] to before Judge Ricardo L. Mosquerra III on September 18, 1992 and
September 23, 1992?


A
    
Yes,
Sir.


Q
    
In
your affidavit on September 16, 1992 subscribed before Judge Mosquerra, you
never mentioned Rudy Legarto as one of the kidnappers, am I correct?


A
    
Yes,
Sir.


Q
    
In
fact, you will agree [with] me that the presence of Maria Abne and Rudy Legarto
was for them to fetch you.  Am I
correct?


A
    
Yes,
Sir.


x x x
                                   
x x x
                            
x x x.â


Regarding the 
P
36,000
which he kept, Legarto alleges that this was payment for his motorcycle which
was taken by Mondaga.  He claims that he
had initially refused to give his motorcycle to Mondaga, but was prevailed upon
by Dr. Resus who told him that she would replace it.
[21]
 Confirming this, Dr. Resus
testified that she told Mrs. Gubantes that the money was payment for Legartoâs
motorcycle,
[22]
 not his share in the ransom.  Thus, such payment could not rationally constitute
evidence of direct participation or of conspiracy in the kidnapping.


Non-appearance at
the Hearings of the Carnapping Case


The solicitor
general and the trial court posit that direct participation was established by
the failure of Legarto to testify against Mondaga in the criminal case for the
carnapping of Legartoâs motorcycle.  The
excuses of Legarto for his inability to attend the hearings -- that he did not
have transportation and that he had stomach ache -- were branded by the
solicitor general as âflimsy and incredible.â  After all, Legarto was able to appear sans such problems when the trial
court ordered the release of the motorcycle.


The contention
is untenable.  Legartoâs lack of
interest in pursuing the criminal case against Mondaga may be less than
laudable, but it does not necessarily show direct participation in the
kidnapping.  Dismissal of cases due to
failure to prosecute is a common legal experience.  Legartoâs excuses for failing to prosecute may be dubious, but
they cannot become the basis for his conviction as a principal by indispensable
cooperation in this case.


âFinger of
Accusationâ Was Baseless


In the assailed
Decision, the trial court states, âAs to how accused Raul Mondaga came to know
that the Resus couple could pay [the] ransom, the finger of suspicion points to
Legarto as [the] source.â
[23]
 However, an examination of the
transcripts of stenographic notes reveals no testimony that Legarto provided
the kidnappers with information regarding the spousesâ finances.  This was pure speculation or suspicion
ânothing more, nothing less.


Elements Required
to Convict By Circumstantial Evidence


A conviction
based on circumstantial evidence requires the concurrence of the following
elements: (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the
inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the
circumstances produces a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.
[24]
 For such a conviction to withstand
judicial scrutiny, the prosecution must further show that all the circumstances
are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the accused is innocent or with any
other rational hypothesis except that of his guilt.
[25]


In this case,
the totality of the pieces of circumstantial evidence being imputed to Legarto
does not foreclose the possibility that he took no part in the criminal
enterprise and does not, therefore, overcome his constitutional right to be
presumed innocent.
[26]


The presumption
of innocence is founded upon substantive law and basic principles of
justice.  It serves to balance the
scales of justice in what would otherwise be an uneven contest between a single
individual accused of a crime and the prosecution which has all the resources
of the government at its command.  Thus,
this presumption cannot be overcome by mere suspicion or conjecture that the
defendant probably committed the crime or that he had the opportunity to do
so.  The prosecution is required to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.  Otherwise, the accused must be set free in
accordance with the rule that conflicts in and insufficiency of evidence must
be resolved in favor of the theory of innocence rather than the theory of
guilt.
[27]


Same  Circumstances  Do  Not Conclusively Show
Conspiracy 


Although the
trial court did not pass upon conspiracy as a source of Legartoâs culpability,
we deem it proper to do so, since it was alleged in the Information.  In theory, conspiracy exists when two or
more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and
decide to commit it.
[28]
 Once established, the act of one
becomes the act of all.  Further,
conspiracy must be shown to exist as clearly as the commission of the offense
itself, although direct proof is not essential.
[29]
 Prior agreement or assent to the
crime is usually inferred from the acts of the accused showing concerted
action, common design and objective, actual cooperation, concurrence of
sentiments, or community of interest.
[30]
 In most cases, like the one at bar,
proof of conspiracy is frequently made by evidence of a chain of circumstances
only.
[31]
 But such proof must always be
established by evidence that satisfies the requirement of proof beyond
reasonable doubt.
[32]


In Legartoâs
case, conspiracy was not at all established by the prosecution.  The familiarity between Legarto and Mondaga
is insufficient proof, as conspiracy transcends companionship.
[33]
 Moreover, Mondagaâs act of meeting
Legarto on the road to Andanan does not show conspiracy, because a merely
casual or unintended meeting, like passive presence, is not proof of conspiracy.
[34]
 Similarly insufficient as
circumstantial evidence to prove conspiracy were Mondagaâs demand for the use
of Legartoâs motorcycle, Legartoâs collecting the ransom money and delivering
part of it, and Legartoâs failure to testify against Mondaga due to either
refusal or neglect.  We stress that
conspiracy must be founded on facts, not on mere inferences and conjectures.
[35]
 Without an allegation of any overt
act showing community with the kidnappers, inferences do not adequately
establish participation in a criminal conspiracy.
[36]


Legartoâs
Criminal Liability


Despite its
belief that Legarto was not a co-principal or a co-conspirator, this Court
cannot completely free him from criminal liability.  Established by the prosecution are the following: (1) he reported
the âlossâ of the motorcycle to the police authorities despite the fact that it
had been given to Mondaga as part of the ransom; (2) he had received 
P
36,000
for it; (3) he paid the balance of the purchase price of the motorcycle with
the said money; and (4) he claimed, regained and retained its possession.


Legarto may not
have had a direct hand in the kidnapping, but he received part of the ransom
and used it to pay off his arrears in his motorcycle loan.  Thus, having knowledge of the kidnapping for
ransom and without having directly participated therein, he took part in the
crime 
subsequent 
to its commission by profiting from its effects.
[37]
 He may not be the devil with the
face of an angel that the trial court described, but he is definitely not a
saint.   He is criminally liable as an
accessory to the crime of kidnapping for ransom.


Under Article 19
of the Revised Penal Code, accessories are defined as those who (1) have
knowledge of the commission of the crime, (2) did not take part in its
commission as principal or accomplice, but (3) took part in it subsequent to
its commission by any of the three modes enumerated in this article,
[38]
 one of which is by profiting or by
assisting the offender to profit from  the effects of the crime.
[39]
 These elements are all present and
proven in Legartoâs case.


As an accessory
to the consummated crime of kidnapping, the penalty imposable upon Legarto is
two degrees lower than that prescribed by law under Article 267 of the said
Code.
[40]
 Since no modifying circumstance is
appreciated for or against him, the imposable penalty should be in the medium
period of the indeterminate sentence applicable under RA 4103, as amended.
[41]


Affirmation of Maluendaâs Conviction


Acquittal is
sought by Maluenda on the ground that only Mondaga executed the acts
constituting kidnapping with ransom; 
i.e., 
demanding and receiving
money, medicine and ransom from the Resus couple and detaining Engineer
Resus.  He avers that his presence at
the hideout in Alegria was involuntary because Mondaga had threatened his life
and the lives of the members of his family.


Such contention
is patently bereft of merit.  Maluendaâs
conviction deserves affirmation based on the precept that actions speak louder
than words.  Established by the prosecution
beyond cavil was his direct participation in the criminal conspiracy to kidnap
Engineer Resus, who testified that Maluenda was one of the men who had, on the
night of August 19, 1992, extorted money and medicine from him and his wife,
who corroborated this story.

Engineer Resusâ
testimony that  Maluenda guarded the
kidnappersâ hideout was corroborated by Abne, the housemaid, as follows:
[46]


âQ:
  
Where
were you bound for with your companions, Rudy Legarto and Bobong Gonzaga?

Although only
Mondaga verbally extorted money and demanded ransom from the Resus couple, it
is evident that the kidnapping was committed with Maluendaâs
participation.  Beyond reasonable doubt,
Maluendaâs actions exhibited a community of interest and a concurrence of
sentiment with Mondaga.  Consequently
inevitable as they relate to Maluenda are the following holdings of the trial
court:
[47]


âxxx Simply stated, the
witnesses for the prosecution, in contrast to that [of] the defense, are, in
the Courtâs assessment, unquestionably reliable, sincere and candor [sic] in
their testimonies which [were] very logical and credible.


    
x x x
   
x x x
   
x x x


and, as between
the affirmative testimony of the prosecution witnesses and that of the negative
versions of the defense, the former [was] more stronger [sic].  The accuseds [sic] resorted to unfounded
denials.


    
x x x
   
x x x
   
x x x


To summarize, the Court
finds that a clear case of kidnapping for ransom [had] been successfully
committed by all the accuseds [sic] charged in the information, who are all
private individuals; that the victim of that heinous crime [was] Engr. Miguel
E. Resus; that ransom money was actually paid in consideration of his release
on the third day that he was forcibly deprived of his liberty; xxx.


Accused Raul Mondaga, alias
Bobong Gonzaga, and Accused Daniel Maluenda, alias Commander Dongkoy have both
been positively identified as among the active perpetrators. x x x x.â


Insofar as
Maluenda is concerned,  we find
applicable the well-entrenched rule that the factual findings of the trial
court are binding on the appellate court.
[48]
 In this light, our earlier holding
negating the trial courtâs assessment of the circumstantial evidence pertains
only to Appellant Legarto, not to Appellant Maluenda.


WHEREFORE
, the appeal is partially
granted.  The assailed Decision is
hereby 
AFFIRMED 
as regards Maluenda, but 
MODIFIED 
as regards
Legarto.  Legarto is hereby found 
GUILTY

as an 
ACCESSORY 
only and is 
ORDERED 
to serve the
indeterminate sentence of two (2) years, four (4) months and one day of 
prisiÃ³n
correccional, 
  as  minimum,  to eight (8) years and one day of 
prisiÃ³n mayor, 
as maximum.  He is further ordered to 
RETURN 
to
Engineer and Dr. Miguel E. Resus the amount of thirty-six thousand pesos (
P
36,000)
corresponding to the amount he used to pay his loan arrears.  The amount which the trial court ordered to
be restituted by Mondaga and Maluenda is accordingly reduced by said amount.
