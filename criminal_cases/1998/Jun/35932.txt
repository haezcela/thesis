(pp. 116-118, Rollo)
  




On motion, the four cases were consolidated, and pleas of not guilty 
having been entered, a joint trial on the merits ensued, following 
which, a judgment of conviction was rendered, the dispositive portion of
 which reads:



WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused, Lito Lagarteja, in Criminal
 Case No. 88-61750, and Roberto Lagarteja, in Criminal Case No. 
88-639954, GUILTY of the crime of Murder, and hereby sentences them to

Carcillar, the amount of Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos each, 
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.
  


With Costs
  


SO ORDERED.
  


(pp. 16-17, Rollo)
  




The prosecutionâs version of the episode is based on the testimony of
 its witnesses, namely, Elisa Jumatiao, Emily Tipora, Ferdinand 
Carcillar, Roberto Imnas, Dr. Prospero Cabaluna, Dr. Cesar Paloma, Pfc. 
Benjamin Nuguid, and Patrolman Manuel Lao. The Office of the Solicitor 
General summarized the events as follows:



Around 6:45 p.m. on March 13, 1988, Elisa Jumatyao was along Quezon
 St., Tondo Manila buying food from Aling Neneâs Store when she spotted 
appellants Lito Lagarteja and Roberto Lagarteja, each holding a fan 
knife, approaching (TSN, November 10, 1988, pp. 4-5). Suddenly, she saw 
Lito Lagarteja stab Ferdinand Carcellar who was standing by the door of 
the store of Roberto Emnas, about five (5) meters from her (TSN, January
 19, 1988, pp. 3-4, TSN, April 7, 1989, p. 6). Roberto Lagarteja waited 
nearby as a back âup. 


Then, appellants walked towards a group consisting of Generoso 
Tipora, Gregorio Tipora and a certain Manny, who were conversing, after 
which Lito Lagarteja stabbed Generoso Tipora, hitting the latter on the 
chest at a spot near the heart. Roberto Lagarteja again acted as a 
back-up (TSN, November 10. 1990, pp. 7-8). Whereupon, appellants 
proceeded to Magsaysay Street, which runs parallel to Quezon Street. 
Along the way, they encountered Roberto Emnas who was stabbed by Lito 
Lagarteja on the chest (TSN, August 11, 1989, p. 7). As Roberto Emnas 
ran away calling for help, he encountered Pat. Manuel Lao. Roberto Emnas
 pointed at both appellants who were running away. Pat. Lao gave chase 
and shot and hit him. (TSN, October 20, 1989, pp. 7-10).
  


Generoso Tipora and Roberto Emnas were taken to the Mary Johnston 
Hospital (TSN, January 19, 1989, p. 11) while Ferdinand Carcellar and 
Lito Lagarteja were taken to the Tondo General Hospital (TSN, November 
10, 1990, p. 9, November 10, 1990, pp. 6-7). Generoso Tipora died upon 
arrival at the Mary Johnston Hospital (Exhibit âBâ). Pat. Manuel Lao 
suffered a stab wound on his left arm but was not hospitalized (TSN, 
October 20, 1989, p. 7) 


(pp. 79-81, Rollo)
  




Dr. Prospero A. Cabanayan of the National Bureau of Investigation, 
Medico Legal Division issued the following Postmortem Report on Generoso
 Tipora:



Pallor, lips and nailbeds
  


Stab wound, chest, left side, anterior aspect, level of 2nd 
intercostal space, 8.0 cm., from anterior median line, oriented upward 
and literally, fusiforon, 1.7 cm. long edges, clean cut, upper

perforating pericardium, heart, left ventricular wall, interventricular,
 septum, with an appropriate depth of 12.0 cm.

        Hemothorax, left, approximately 1,600 c.c.
        

        Brain and other visceral organs, pale
        

        Stomach, full of undigested rice and other food particles.




Cause of death â Hemorrhage, severe, secondary to stab wound. 


(pp. 120-121, Rollo)
  




Dr. Cesar J. Paloma examined and attended to the wounds of victims Ferdinand Carcillar and Roberto Imnas.

The version of the events presented by the accused, on the other 
hand, is to the effect that at about 5 oâclock on the afternoon of March
 13, 1988, Roberto, a pedicab driver, happened to pass by the house of 
Roberto Imnas and saw Ferdinand Carcillar talking to his gangmates, at 
which time, he did not notice any unusual incident. Later, at around 
6:45 oâclock that evening, unknown to Roberto, his brother Lito, 
motivated by revenge, stabbed Ferdinand Carcillar while the latter was 
at the door of the house of Imnas, because Carcillar had earlier created
 trouble at the dancing hall while high on drugs. Afterwards, Lito went 
home and talked with his gangmates in front of their house located at 
90-A Quezon Street, Bo. Magsaysay, Tondo, Manila. At the time of the 
stabbing of Carcillar, Roberto was not with his brother, Lito Lagarteja 
(p. 36 Rollo).

In the meantime, Roberto Lagarteja was on his way home on his 
pedicab and upon arriving at Quezon Street, he noted people scampering 
in all directions shouting that somebody had been stabbed. Pat. Manuel 
Lao, passing by the front of the house of Roberto Imnas, was informed 
that it was Lito who stabbed Carcillar, so Pat. Lao proceeded to the 
house, he was asked to surrender by the policeman. When there was no 
response, Pat. Lao started firing the house. Upon seeing Lito outside 
their house, Roberto called to his brother to go inside, but Lito did 
not take heed. Instead, Lito stabbed Pat. Lao, hitting him on the arm, 
for fear that Pat. Lao would hit his brother Roberto (pp. 36-37, 
Ibid
.)

Both Roberto and Lito confided that they had no quarrel with 
Generoso Tipora, or with Roberto Imnas, and prosecution witness Elisa 
Jumatiao (p. 37, 
Ibid
.)

Moreover, Lito claimed that he could not have stabbed Roberto 
Imnas from behind, because Imnas is much taller and bigger than him. 
Likewise, defense witness Leonila Tepace asserted that Generoso Tipora 
was stabbed by Litoâs companion in the course of the commotion and that 
Roberto was not there at all (p. 37, 
Ibid
.)

The trial courtâs judgement of conviction is based on the 
testimony of prosecution witnesses who were given complete credence. 
Prosecution witness Elisa Jumatiaoâs identification of the two brothers 
in the killing of Generoso Tipora and in the stabbing of Roberto Imnas 
and Ferdinand Carcillar was found by the trial court to be more credible
 because this witness was not shown to have any improper motibe for 
testifying against accused-appellants (p. 14, 
Ibid
.).

Victims Ferdinand Carcillar and Roberto Imnas corroborated each 
otherâs testimony when they both pinpointed accused-appellant Lito 
Lagarteja as the perpetrator of the crime (p.15, 
Ibid
.)

During the trial, although no evidence was adduced directly 
showing Roberto as having actively participated in the fatal stabbing of
 Generoso Tipora and the wounding of Roberto Imnas and Ferdinand 
Carcillar, the trial court asserted that he and his brother, Lito, 
displayed unity of purpose adndesign in causing death and injuries to 
the victims. The presence of Roberto at the crime scene with his 
brother, Lito, was amply proven, thus, establishing the element of 
conspiracy. Robertoâs defense of alibi was found unavailing as against 
the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses who did not 
display bad faith or any illicit intention in testifying against the 
accused, and whose accounts are believable, natural, and cohesive and 
mutually corroborative (p. 16, 
Ibid
.).

Aggrieved by the trial courtâs decision, the brothers appealed to
 the Court of Appeals, anchoring their plea for reversal upon the 
following assigned errors:



I     THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED ROBERTO LAGARTEJA 
GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF GENEROSO TIPORA
 AND OF FRUSTRATED MURDER, ON TWO OF THE DEATH OF GENEROSO TIPORA AND OF
 FRUSTRATED MURDER, ON TWO COUNTS, ON ACCOUNT OF THE STABBING OF 
FERDINAND CARCILLAR AND ROBERTO IMNAS.
  


II    THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED LITO LAGARTEJA 
GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEATH OF GENEROSO 
TIPORA, OF FRUSTRATED MURDER, ON TWO COUNTS, FOR THE STABBING OF ROBERTO
 IMNAS AND FERDINAND CARCILLAR.
  


III   THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS ELISA JUMATIAO.
  


IV  THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING FULL CREDENCE TO THE DEFENSES OF THE ACCUSED.
  


(pp. 122-123, Rollo)
  




Finding the appeal to be partially impressed with merit, the Court of Appeals disposed:



WHEREFORE:
  


ROBERTO LAGARTEJA is hereby ACQUITTED of the charges against him in
 Criminal Cases Nos. 88-63954 and 88-63473 on the ground of failure of 
the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt;
  


LITO LAGARTEJA, in Criminal Case No. 88-63473, is sentenced to 
suffer the penalty of FOUR MONTHS and ONE DAY (4 MONTHS AND 1 DAY) of 
arresto mayor as minimum, to FOUR YEARS (4 years) of prision 
correccional, as maximum, there being no mitigating or aggravating 
circumstances and after applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law.
  


LITO LAGARTEJA, in Criminal Case No. 88-63474, is sentenced to 
suffer the penalty of thirty days and one day (30 days and 1 day) of 
arresto mayor as minimum to two years and six months (2 years and 6 
months) of prision correccional as maximum, after applying the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law, there being no mitigating or aggravating 
circumstances;
  


FINALLY, the Court of Appeals RESPECTFULLY ELEVATES to the 
Honorable Supreme Court, the judgment in Criminal Case No. 88-61750 
where the Court of Appeals respectfully recommends the affirmance of the
 appealed judgment, and that the appellant LITO LAGARTEJA be made to 
suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua plus payment of civil indemnity
 in the amount of P50,000.00 to the heirs of the victim.
  


Cost against the appellant Lito Lagarteja.
  


SO ORDERED.
  


(p. 130, Rollo)
  




The Court of Appeals rejected the trial courtâs finding of conspiracy
 as the underlying principle behind Roberto Lagartejaâs conviction for 
Murder and Frustrated Murder on two counts. The appellate court 
maintained that the prosecution failed to prove the existence of 
conspiracy beyond reasonable doubt, hence, Robertoâs acquittal is thus 
final.

Likewise, the Court of Appealsâ decision in Criminal Case No. 
88-63473 and 88-63474 need not be looked into, the same having become 
final and executory (p. 138, Rollo).

Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals seeks the affirmance of this 
Court anent its disposition in Criminal Case No. 88-61750 in which it 
affirmed the trial courtâs conviction of accused-appellant Lito 
Lagarteja of the crime of Murder with respect to the death of Generoso 
Tipora for which Lito was sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion 
perpetua, plus payment of civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 (p
 130, rollo).

We find no reason to disagree.

All that accused-appellant Lito Lagarteja offers by way of 
defense is denial, which plea has been viewed with disfavor by the 
courts due to the facility with which it can be concocted (
People vs. Dancio
,
 253 SCRA 146 [1996]). Verily, Litoâs denial is a feeble one which 
cannot stand against the positive testimony of the eyewitnesses of the 
crime (People vs. Flores, (252 SCRA 31 [1996]).

The positive identification of Lito Lagarteja as the perpetrator 
of the crime by prosecution witness Elisa Jumatiao must be given full 
faith and credit. Positive identification prevails over denials (
People vs. Abrenica
,
 252 SCRA 54 [1996]). While admittedly, Elisa Jumatiao is the neighbor 
of Generoso Tipora since she was a child, this fact alone should not be 
considered as corrosive of her testimony. No ill motives whatsoever have
 been attributed to her as to why she should falsely testify against 
accused-appellant Lito and implicate him in the crime. We quote in this 
regard the pertinent testimony of Jumatiao, thusly:



Q     Now, after Lito Lagarteja stabbed Ferdinand Carcillar, what happened next?
  


A      Then they walked towards Generoso Tipora.
  


Q     And what was Generoso Tipora doing when the two accused were walking towards them?
  


A      They were three having a talk at the corner of Camias St. and Quezon St.
  


Q     And who this third person, who was in company of Generoso Tipora?
  


A      Gregorio. They were talking to Gregorio and Manny whose family name I do not know, and to Generoso Tipora.
  


Q     They were three including Generoso?
  


A      Yes, sir.
  


FISCAL
  


Q     Now, when they were talking to each other, what happened thereafter?
  


A      The two brothers (witness pointing to the two accused passed
 in the middle of the three persons and suddenly stabbed them.
  


Q     Who were stabbed when the two accused passed these three persons you mentioned?
  


A      Generoso Tipora and Roberto Imnas were stabbed.
  


COURT
  


A      The question is, who was stabbed when they passed?
  


A      Generoso Tipora only.
  


FISCAL
  


Q     Who actually stabbed Generoso Tipora when the two accused reached them?
  


A      Lito Lagarteja, sir.
  


Q     And where was Generoso Tipora stabbed?
  


A      He was stabbed at the heart.
  


Q     How many times did Lito Lagarteja stab Generoso Ripora?
  


WITNESS
  


A      Only once.
  


Q     Now, when Lito Lagarteja was stabbing Generoso Tipora, what was Roberto Lagarteja doing at that time?
  


A      He was a back-up of Lito Lagarteja.
  


Q     And what happened after Lito Lagarteja stabbed Generoso Tipora?
  


A      Then the two accused turned around and proceeded towards Magsaysay St.
  


(pp. 6-7, tsn, November 10, 1990)
  




The foregoing testimony clearly shows that prosecution witness Elisa 
Jumatiao positively identified accused appellant Lito Lagarteja as the 
culprit. In the same manner, the court a quo accurately held that the 
killing of Generoso Tipora was unquestionably committed with treachery. 
There is treachery where the evidence shows that the mode of attack was 
consciously and deliberately adopted by the accused, such that the 
victim who would have no inkling of the danger to his life prior to the 
attack (
People vs. Juan
, 254 SCRA 478 [1996]). Tipora was 
completely unaware of the murderous design of accused-appellant Lito 
Lagarteja. Tipora was talking to Gregorio and Manny at the corner of 
Camias and Quezon Streets, when he was suddenly, without warning stabbed
 by Lito. While it may be true that a sudden and unexpected attack is 
not always treacherous, in the case at bar, however, there was treachery
 because this type of assault was deliberately adopted by Lito. As 
Gregorio was conversing with his friends, accused-appellant Lito 
Lagarteja sneaked into the midst and suddenly stabbed Gregorio in the 
chest. The victim was afforded no opportunity to put up any defense 
whatsoever, while the assailant was exposed to no risk at all, and that 
form of attack, evidently, was consciously adopted by him. The essence 
of treachery is a swift and unexpected attack on an unarmed victim 
without the slightest provocation on his part (
People vs. Vallador
,
 257 SCRA 515 [1996]). Although the victim and his assailant were face 
to face at the time the stabbing was made, where it appears that the 
attack was not preceded by a dispute and offended party was unable to 
prepare for defense, treachery should be taken into account. 
(U.S. vs. Cornejo
, 28 Phil 457,461).

As to accused-appellant Lito Lagartejaâs civil liability, the 
trial court correctly awarded P50,000.00 as indemnity for death in 
accordance with current jurisprudence.

WHEREFORE
, conformably with the recommendation 
of the Court of Appeals, accused-appellant Lito Lagarteja is hereby 
found guilty of Murder andis correspondingly sentenced to suffer the 
penalty of reclusion perpetua and is ordered to indemnify the heirs of 
the victim in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00).
