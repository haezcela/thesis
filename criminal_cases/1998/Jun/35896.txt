PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. WILFREDO FELOTEO, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




PUNO, J.:


Accused 
WILFREDO FELOTEO
 was charged with and convicted of the crimes of 
Murder
, as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and 
Illegal Possession of Firearm
, a violation of Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1866. 

The Informations against accused read:



In Criminal Case No. 11109
  


"That on or about the 6th day of May, 1993, in the evening, at 
Sitio Nagbaril, Barangay Bintuan, Municipality of Coron, Province of 
Palawan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the said accused, 
with evident premeditation and treachery
, while armed with a firearm and with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously shoot with his firearm, to wit: an armalite rifle, one SONNY SOTTO
,
 hitting him on the vital part of his body and inflicting upon him a 
gunshot wound on the left side of his chest, thru and thru, which injury
 was the direct and immediate cause of his instantaneous death. 
(emphasis ours) 


"CONTRARY TO LAW and committed with aggravating circumstance of treachery."
  


In Criminal Case No. 11644
  


"That on or about the 6th day of May, 1993, and prior thereto, at 
Sitio Nagbaril, Barangay Bintuan, Municipality of Coron, Province of 
Palawan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the said accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously
 have in his possession, custody and control, one armalite rifle with 
Serial No. 9035914 and ammunitions, without any license or permit to 
possess
 the same and that this firearm was 
used in shooting to death one SONNY SOTTO

 in a case of Murder filed with the RTC of Palawan and Puerto Princesa 
City, docketed as Criminal Case No. 11109 and that this crime have no 
relation or in furtherance of the crime of rebellion or subversion. 
(emphasis ours) 


"CONTRARY TO LAW."
  




When arraigned, accused pled not guilty. Trial ensued.

The records show that in the evening of May 6, 1993, the victim, 
SONNY SOTTO, and his friends, ARNEL ABELEDA and JOHNNY ABREA, were 
walking along the highway in Barangay Bintuan, Coron, Province of 
Palawan. They had a few drinks earlier that day and were on their way 
home to Sitio Nagbaril. Abrea walked ahead of the group, about thirteen 
meters away from Sotto, followed by Abeleda. They were in a lively mood 
as Abeleda playfully walked backwards, facing Sotto.
[1]


The accused, WILFREDO FELOTEO, appeared on the opposite side of 
the road and walked past Abrea and Abeleda. He was armed with an 
armalite rifle. Abeleda and Abrea recognized the accused, their 
barriomate, as the moon was shining brightly. They did not pay much 
attention to the accused as Abeleda was playing "
habulan
" with 
Sotto. Without uttering a word, the accused aimed the armalite at Sotto 
and pressed its trigger. Sotto was hit above the left chest and fell on 
the ground, face down. Abeleda and Abrea scampered away to find help, 
while the accused fled from the crime scene.
[2]
 Ten (10) minutes later, Abeleda and Abrea, accompanied by 
Barangay Tanod
 Tito Abrina and a certain Inyong Adion, returned to the 
locus criminis
. They found Sotto dead. 

Sotto was brought to the hospital for autopsy. The Autopsy Report
 showed that he sustained a gunshot wound, with the bullet entering the 
left side of his collarbone and exiting at the spinal cord. The bullet 
came from an M-16 armalite rifle. He also had abrasions on the knees and
 face. Dr. Hew G. Curameng of the Palawan Provincial Hospital opined 
that Sotto fell on his knees before he slumped on the ground, face down.
 There were no powder burns on his body, indicating that the victim was 
shot from a distance. The cause of death was massive blood loss 
secondary to gunshot wound.
[3]


The firearm used in the shooting incident belongs to SPO2 Roman 
Adion. On May 6, 1993, SPO2 Adion went to the house of Teofisto Alaquin 
in Sitio Nagbaril. He brought with him his official service firearm, an 
M-16 armalite rifle,
[4]
 as he 
has been ordered to go to Jandanao the next day to investigate a land 
dispute. He slept early. At around 6:30 p.m., Alaquin woke him up and 
informed him that the accused stole his armalite. SPO2 Adion, together 
with Nazario Adion and Frank Adion, immediately looked for the accused. 
They heard a gunshot coming from a distance of about four hundred (400) 
meters and rushed to the place where it emanated. They saw Sotto lying 
prostrate on the road, shot on the chest. SPO2 Adion suspected that his 
armalite was used in the shooting incident and he continued his hunt for
 the accused. The next day, May 7, 1993, at 5:00 a.m., he nabbed the 
accused in Sitio Cabugao, five (5) kilometers away from the crime scene.
 The accused surrendered the armalite to him. Upon inspection, SPO2 
Adion found nineteen (19) bullets left in the armalite. There were 
twenty (20) bullets inside the armalite chamber and magazine before it 
was stolen.
[5]


SPO4 Jose Ansay, Chief of the Firearm and Explosive Unit of the 
Philippine National Police (PNP) in Tiniguiban, Puerto Princesa City, 
Palawan, affirmed that the accused was not duly licensed to carry a 
firearm.
[6]


The accused denied that he stole SPO2 Adion's armalite and 
alleged that the shooting of Sotto was an accident. He averred that on 
May 6, 1993, he was in his sister's house in Barangay Bintuan, Coron, 
when SPO2 Adion passed by and invited him over to the place of Teofisto 
Alaquin in Nagbaril. They boarded SPO2 Adion's tricycle and arrived at 
Nagbaril at about 3:00 p.m. Frank Adion dropped by the house of Alaquin 
and borrowed the tricycle of SPO2 Adion. Frank Adion later returned on 
foot and told SPO2 Adion that the tricycle's engine broke down so he 
left it along the road. SPO2 Adion checked on his tricycle and left 
behind his armalite rifle. Before leaving, he instructed the accused to 
wait for him at Alaquin's house.
[7]


After thirty minutes, the accused decided to follow SPO2 Adion. 
He took the armalite and walked the road leading to Bintuan. At about 
7:00 p.m., he met Sonny Sotto's group. They zigzagged as they walked. In
 jest, the accused said to Sotto, "Boots, don't get near me, I'll shoot 
you." He pointed the armalite to Sotto and pressed its trigger, 
allegedly unaware that it was loaded. It fired and hit Sotto. The 
accused fled but was apprehended by SPO2 Adion the following day. He 
told SPO2 Adion that he accidentally shot Sotto.
[8]


After trial, the accused was found guilty as charged.
[9]

 He was sentenced to suffer the penalties of reclusion perpetua, for 
murder, and imprisonment of twenty (20) years, for illegal possession of
 firearm. He was further ordered to pay the heirs of Sotto the amount of
 fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00), as civil indemnity. 

In this appeal, appellant contends:



"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN APPRECIATING THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE 
OF TREACHERY AS ATTENDING THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME ALLEGED AND IN 
HOLDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF MURDER IN THE KILLING OF SONNY 
SOTTO."
  




We affirm the judgment of conviction.

We reject the argument of the appellant that he should not have 
been convicted for murder as treachery was not duly established by the 
prosecution. Allegedly, Sotto knew of the impending attack for it was 
frontal. Moreover, Sotto was warned, albeit jokingly, that he was going 
to be shot. 

Under par. 16, Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code, the 
qualifying circumstance of treachery is present when the offender 
employs means, methods, or forms in the execution of the crime which 
tend directly and especially to insure its execution without risk to 
himself arising from any defensive or retaliatory act which the victim 
might make.
[10]
 The settled rule is that 
treachery can exist even if the attack is frontal
 if it is 
sudden and unexpected
,
 giving the victim no opportunity to repel it or defend himself. What is
 decisive is that the execution of the attack, without the slightest 
provocation from a victim who is unarmed, made it impossible for the 
victim to defend himself or to retaliate.
[11]


In the case at bar, treachery is present for there was a sudden 
attack against the unarmed Sotto. When Sotto and his friends encountered
 appellant on the road, they were in a "jovial mood" as they just came 
from a drinking spree. Although they saw appellant carrying an armalite,
 they did not suspect anything untoward to happen. However, without any 
provocation, appellant shot Sotto. The fact that the attack was frontal 
cannot negate treachery. The shooting was unexpected. There is no 
showing that the alleged warning given by appellant to Sotto afforded 
the latter sufficient time to defend himself. Indeed, Sotto could not 
defend himself as he was unarmed and a bit drunk-- as observed by the 
appellant himself, the victim was walking in a zigzag manner. There was 
no way for Sotto to avoid the armalite bullets. 

We now come to the penalty imposed on appellant for the illegal 
possession of firearm in view of the recent amendments to P.D. No. 1866 
by R.A. No. 8294. 

Appellant was convicted under Section 1 of P.D. No. 1866, the governing law at the time the crime was committed. It provides:



"SEC. 1. 
Unlawful Manufacture, Sale, Acquisition, Disposition 
or Possession of Firearms, Ammunition or Instruments Used or Intended to
 be Used in the Manufacture of Firearms or Ammunition
.- The penalty of 
reclusion temporal
 in its maximum period to 
reclusion perpetua

 shall be imposed upon any person who shall unlawfully manufacture, deal
 in, acquire, dispose or possess any firearm, part of firearm, 
ammunition of machinery, tool or instrument used or intended to be used 
in the manufacture of any firearm or ammunition. 


If homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, the penalty of death shall be imposed
." (emphasis ours) 




The penalty for the aggravated form of illegal possession of firearm 
under P.D. No. 1866 is death. Since at that time, the death penalty 
cannot be enforced in view of Article III (19) (1) of the 1987 
Constitution, appellant should have been sentenced to serve the penalty 
of 
reclusion perpetua
,
[12]
 not twenty (20) years of imprisonment. 

Nonetheless, Republic Act No. 8294, amended P.D. No. 1866, by 
reducing the penalties for simple and aggravated forms of illegal 
possession of firearms.
[13]
 The law now provides:



"Section 1. 
Unlawful Manufacture, Sale, Acquisition, 
Disposition or Possession of Firearms or Ammunition or Instruments Used 
or Intended to be Used in the Manufacture of Firearms or Ammunition
.- The penalty of 
prision correccional in its maximum period

 and a fine of not less than Fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000.00) shall 
be imposed upon any person who shall unlawfully manufacture, deal in, 
acquire, dispose, or possess any 
low powered firearm
 
such as rimfire handgun, .380 or .32 and other firearm of similar 
firepower, ammunition, or machinery, tool or instrument used or intended
 to be used in the manufacture of any firearm or ammunition: Provided, 
That no other crime was committed. 


The penalty of 
prision mayor in its minimum period
 and a fine of Thirty thousand pesos (P30,000.00) shall be imposed if the firearm is classified as 
high powered firearm

 which includes those with bores bigger in diameter than .38 caliber and
 9 millimeter such as caliber .40, .41, .45 and also lesser caliber 
firearms but considered powerful such as caliber .357 and caliber .22 
center-fire magnum and other firearms with firing capability of full 
automatic and by burst of two or three: Provided, however, That no other
 crime was committed by the person arrested.
  


If homicide or murder is committed with the use of 
unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm shall be 
considered as an aggravating circumstance
. (emphasis ours)
  


xxx         xxx         xxx
  


Sec. 5. Coverage of the Term Unlicensed Firearm. - The term unlicensed firearm shall include:
  


 firearms with expired license, or
  
 unauthorized use of licensed firearm in the commission of the crime."
  




Clearly, the penalty for illegal possession of high powered firearm is 
prision mayor in its minimum period

 and a fine of P30,000.00. In case homicide or murder is committed with 
the use of unlicensed firearm, such use of unlicensed firearm shall be 
merely considered as an aggravating circumstance.

The enactment of R.A. No. 8294 can be given retroactive effect as it favors the appellant.
[14]
 So we held in 
People vs. Simon
,
[15]
 
viz
:



"Since obviously, the favorable provisions of Republic Act 7659 
could neither have been involved or invoked in the present case, a 
corollary question would be whether this court, at the present stage, 
can 
sua sponte
 apply the provisions of Article 22 to reduce the
 penalty to be imposed on appellant. That issue has likewise been 
resolved in the cited case of People vs. Moran, 
et al., ante.
, thus: 




`x x x. The plain precept contained in article 22 of the Penal 
Code, declaring the retroactivity of penal laws in so far as they are 
favorable to persons accused of a felony, would be useless and nugatory 
if the courts of justice were not under obligation to fulfill such duty,
 irrespective of whether or not the accused has applied for it, just as 
would also all provisions relating to the prescription of the crime and 
the penalty.'
    




If the judgment which could be affected and modified by the reduced
 penalties provided in Republic Act No. 7659 has already become final 
and executory or the accused is serving sentence thereunder, then 
practice, procedure and pragmatic consideration would warrant and 
necessitate the matter being brought to the judicial authorities for 
relief under a writ of habeas corpus." (footnote omitted) 




As mentioned above, the penalty for simple illegal possession of high powered firearm 
is prision mayor in its minimum period
.
[16]

 This penalty was taken from the Revised Penal Code, hence, although 
P.D. No. 1866, as amended by RA 8294, is a special law, the rules in 
said Code for graduating penalties by degrees or determining the proper 
period should be applied.
[17]


In the case at bar, an unlicensed firearm was used in committing 
murder, thus, aggravating the crime and increasing the imposable penalty
 to the 
maximum period of prision mayor minimum
, the duration of which ranges from seven (7) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to eight (8) years.
[18]


We determine the minimum and maximum sentence pursuant to the first part of Section 1 of the Indeterminate Sentence Law
[19]

 which directs that "in imposing a prison sentence for an offense 
punished by the Revised Penal Code, or its amendments, the court shall 
sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence, the 
maximum

 term of which shall be that which, in view of the attending 
circumstances, could be properly imposed under the rules of said Code, 
and the 
minimum
 of which shall be within the range of the 
penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Code
 for the offense." 

Accordingly, the 
minimum
 range of the indeterminate sentence shall be taken from any of the periods of 
prision correccional maximum
, the penalty next lower in degree to the penalty of prision mayor minimum. 
Prision correccional maximum
 has a duration of four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day to six (6) years. On the other hand, the 
maximum

 penalty to be imposed, taking into consideration the aggravating 
circumstance attending the commission of the crime, shall be taken from 
the 
maximum period of prision mayor minimum
 which ranges from seven (7) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to eight (8) years.

IN VIEW WHEREOF
, the judgment against appellant 
in Criminal Case Nos. 11109 (for Murder) and Criminal Case No. 11644 
(for Illegal Possession of Firearm) is AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION 
that, in Criminal Case No. 11644, appellant should be sentenced, as he 
is hereby sentenced, to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years of 
prision correccional, as the minimum term, and eight (8) years of 
prision mayor minimum, as the maximum term. No costs.

[19]
 See People vs. Simon, supra, where we held:

"6.          The final query is whether or not the Indeterminate 
Sentence Law is applicable to the case now before us. x x x The more 
important aspect, however, is how the indeterminate sentence shall be 
ascertained.

"It is true that Section 1 of said law, after providing for 
indeterminate sentence for an offense under the Revised Penal Code, 
states that `if the offense is punished by any other law, the court 
shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence, the maximum 
term of which shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the 
minimum shall not be less than the minimum term prescribed by the same.'
 We hold that this quoted portion of the section indubitably refers to 
an offense under a special law wherein the penalty imposed was not taken
 from and is without reference to the Revised Penal Code, as discussed 
in the preceding illustrations, such that it may be said that the 
`offense is punished' under the law."
