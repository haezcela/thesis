[ G.R. No. 221436, June 26, 2019 ]


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ERIC DUMDUM, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. 
DECISION




LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


The Case
This appeal assails the Decision
[1]
 dated May 27, 2015 of the Court of Appeals (CA) affirming the trial court's verdict of conviction
[2]
 against appellant Eric Dumdum for rape.
The Information
Appellant Eric Dumdum was charged with rape, as follows:
"That on the 17
th
 day of November,(sic) 1997, at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening, at 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie and succeed in having carnal knowledge with AAA,
*
 14 years of age, against her will and consent.
CONTRARY TO LAW."
[3]
The case was raffled to the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 29, Toledo City, Cebu.
The Proceedings before the Trial Court
On arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty.
[4]
 During the trial, AAA and Dr. Roderick Asagra testified for the prosecution. On the other hand, appellant Eric Dumdum and Lucille RicaÃ±a testified for the defense.
Evidence of the Prosecution
[5]
Fourteen year old AAA worked at a canteen at  
xxxxxxxxxxx
, 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, Cebu. On November 17, 1997, around 9 o'clock in the evening, she left her workplace. She passed by the store of Ramos along the national road and in front of the 
xxxxxxxxxxx
National Hospital. She bought food and ate at the store, thereafter, she headed home. She walked by the side of 
xxxxxxxxxxx
 National High School. As she was walking, she heard appellant call her name so she approached him. She knew appellant was one of the workers in Metaphil Corporation where she delivered food.
Appellant dragged her to a dark area near the corner of the road where there were no vehicles passing by. There were also no houses around. Appellant lifted her and laid her down on the grass. She tried resisting him but failed. He threatened to kill her and her parents. Appellant then removed her t-shirt and shorts, sucked her breast, and kissed her neck. He took off her panty and went on top of her. He, too, removed his briefs, spread her legs open, and inserted his penis in her vagina. She felt pain while appellant made push and pull movements for about a minute. He continued kissing her neck while she cried.
When appellant had finished ravishing her, he let her leave. She did not tell anyone about the rape because she was scared appellant would make good his threat to kill her and her parents. Two days later, her co-worker told her parents about the kiss marks on her neck. Consequently, she was constrained to tell her parents what really happened to her. Together with her parents, she went to the municipal hall of 
xxxxxxxxxxx
 to have the incident blottered. She was also medically examined by Dr. Roderick Asagra.
Dr. Asagra's medical findings revealed hymenal lacerations and contusions on AAA's breast, viz "2.0 cm. x 1.5 cm. contusion on the left breast or a bruising due to hematoma about 1 to 3 days old because it was still bluish; the genitalia admitted one finger with ease and the hymen was lacerated at 10 o'clock position most likely caused by a penetrating penis."
[6]
Evidence for the Defense
[7]
Appellant claimed that on November 17, 1997, he and another companion were drinking with his cousin Owen Dumdum in front of the store where AAA bought and ate her snacks. They finished drinking around 9 o'clock in the evening and he arrived home by 9:30 in the evening. He admitted knowing AAA because he was a customer at the canteen where she worked. He denied having seen AAA approach the store that night. He quit his work at the Metaphil Corporation two days after the incident when he learned of the case filed against him. He left 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, 
xxxxxxxxxxx
 Cebu on November 21, 1997 or four days after the incident.
Lucille RicaÃ±a testified she was the niece of the owner of the store which appellant frequented. On November 17, 1997, she tended the store from the time it opened until it closed by 10 o'clock in the evening. Appellant and his companions arrived around 5:30 in the afternoon and drank until 9 o'clock in the evening, after which, they all went home. She denied seeing AAA that night.
The Trial Court's Ruling
By Decision dated May 25, 2012, the trial court rendered a verdict of conviction, thus:
WHEREFORE
, in light of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused 
ERIC DUMDUM
 "
guilty
" beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
RECLUSION PERPETUA
 together with all the accessory penalties provided for by law and to indemnify private complainant AAA the following amounts:
Fifty thousand Pesos (P50,000) by way of civil indemnity; and
Fifty thousand Pesos (P50,000) by way of moral damages.
The preventive imprisonment undergone by accused is fully credited in his favor.
With costs against accused.
SO ORDERED.
[8]
 
The trial court gave full credence to AAA's detailed narration on how appellant succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her through force and intimidation. It also found that her testimony was corroborated by the physical evidence and Dr. Asagra's expert testimony. Finally, it rejected appellant's bare denial and alibi in light of AAA's positive testimony that it was he who sexually violated her.
The Proceedings before the Court of Appeals
On appeal, appellant faulted the trial court for rendering a verdict of conviction despite alleged improbabilities
[9]
  in AAA's testimony, viz: 
first
, the rape incident could not have happened in a place along a well-lighted highway surrounded by a cluster of houses
[10]
 without exposing himself to the eyes and ears of the residents there; 
second
, although AAA claimed to have stopped by the store on her way home, store attendant Lucille RicaÃ±a could not recall having seen her;
[11]
 and 
third
, considering that after drinking with his friends in the same store, he left around 9 o'clock in the evening,
[12]
 he could not have crossed paths with the victim.
On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG)
[13]
 riposted that the elements of rape were sufficiently established through AAA's candid, spontaneous, and straightforward testimony that appellant had carnal knowledge of her through force and intimidation.
[14]
By Decision dated May 27, 2015, the Court of Appeals affirmed with modification, viz:
WHEREFORE
, the Decision dated May 25, 2012, rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 29, Toledo City in Crim. Case No. TCS-2907, finding the appellant, Eric Dumdum, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 together with all the accessory penalties provided by law is hereby 
AFFIRMED 
with the following 
MODIFICATIONS
 as to damages only:    
The amount of civil indemnity is increased to P75,000.
The appellant is ordered to pay the victim the amount of P30,000 as exemplary damages.
 The amount ofP50,000 as moral damages is retained.
 An interest of 6% per annum is imposed on all damages awarded from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.
SO ORDERED
.
[15]
The Court of Appeals concurred with the trial court's factual findings. It rejected the alleged improbabilities appellant had raised. It noted that appellant left four days after the incident and he got arrested at 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, 
xxxxxxxxxxx
,  Cebu after nine years of hiding.
[16]
 It, thus, considered appellant's flight right after the incident as a 
major indicium
 of guilt.
The Present Appeal
Appellant now seeks affirmative relief from the Court and prays anew for his acquittal. In compliance with Resolution dated June 6, 2016, both appellant and the OSG manifested that in lieu of supplemental briefs, they were adopting their respective briefs filed before the Court of Appeals.
[17]
Issue
Did the CA err in affirming appellant's conviction for rape?
Ruling

The trial court keenly noted AAA's positive, straightforward, and categorical narration on how accused "dragged her to a dark place; threatened to kill her should she tell anyone; removed her t-shirt, city shorts, and panty despite her resistance; forcibly laid her on the grass; kissed her and sucked her breast; removed his brief, laid on top of her; inserted his penis in her vagina and made push and pull movements for about one minute."
[19]
A victim of tender age would not have narrated such sordid details had she not experienced them. In a long line of cases,
[20]
 the Court has given full weight and credence to the testimony of child victims.
[21]
 For it is highly improbable that a girl of tender years would impute to any man a crime so serious as rape if what she claims is not true.
[22]
 Thus, AAA's testimony rings a bell of truth. Even standing alone, her credible testimony is sufficient to convict appellant
[23]
 given the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved.
But this is not all. AAA's testimony firmly conformed with Dr. Asagra's medical report that she sustained contusions on her left breast, her vagina admitted one finger with ease, and the hymen was lacerated at 10 o'clock position most likely caused by a penetrating penis.
[24]
 These findings solidly supported AAA's testimony that appellant dragged her to a dark place, forced her to lie on the ground, kissed her, sucked her breast, and inserted his penis in her vagina. Indeed, when the forthright testimony of a rape victim is consistent with medical findings, it is sufficient to support a verdict of guilt for rape.
[25]
Notably, appellant himself has not imputed any ulterior motive which could have impelled AAA to falsely accuse him of such heinous crime as rape. Her disclosure that she had been raped, coupled with her submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of assault against her dignity, cannot be easily dismissed as mere concoction.
[26]
Appellant, nonetheless, undermines AAA's testimony for being allegedly improbable on three counts: 
first
, he refers to the improbability of allowing himself to be exposed to the eyes and ears of people living along a well-lighted national highway near the supposed 
locus criminis
[27]
 
second
, the improbability that AAA stopped by a store to buy food, considering that the store attendant could not even recall having seen her;
[28]
 and 
third
, the improbability that she crossed paths with complainant around 9 o'clock in the evening of November 17, 1997 considering that around that time, he had already left the same sari-sari store and boarded a tricycle to take him home.
[29]
We are not persuaded.
For one
, rapists are not discouraged from committing sexual abuse by the mere presence of people nearby. In other words, rape is committed not exclusively in seclusion.
[30]
 The Court has consistently recognized that rape may be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along roadside, within school premises, inside an occupied house, and even where other members of the family are sleeping.
[31]
 For lust is no respecter of time and place.
[32]
 At any rate, according to AAA, appellant dragged her to a grassy area where no vehicles were passing by and there were no houses around. 
For another
, whether the store attendant could recall or recognize the face of AAA as a customer on the night in question does not have any bearing on appellant's culpability. For AAA positively identified him as the one who sexually forced himself on her around 9 o'clock in the evening of November 17, 1997. 
Finally
, appellant's alibi that he had already left the store and gone home around the same time AAA got raped must fail. In order that alibi may be accorded credibility, appellant must positively demonstrate his presence at another place at the time of the commission of the offense as well as the physical impossibility for him to be at the 
locus criminis
 around the same time.
[33]
  Here, appellant did not present any compelling evidence that it was not physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene on the date and time the crime was committed. In any event, alibi cannot prevail over the victim's positive and unwavering identification of appellant as the one who succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her through force and intimidation.
[34]
 So must it be.
We agree with the Court of Appeals that appellant's abrupt disappearance which lasted for nine long years was indicative of guilt. Appellant disclosed that he abandoned his work two days after he was charged with rape. He also admitted that he left Balamban on November 21, 1997 or four days after the alleged crime was committed. It is well-settled that the flight of an accused may be taken as evidence to establish his guilt.
[35]
  Indeed, the wicked fleeth when no men pursueth, but the innocent is as bold as a lion.
[36]
All told, the Court of Appeals did not err in affirming appellant's conviction for rape and the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 imposed on him. This is in accordance with Article 266-A, in relation to 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, viz:
Article 266-A. Rape: When And How Committed. - Rape is committed:
1) B
y a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman
 under any of the following circumstances:
a) 
Through force, threat, or intimidation;
xxx                  xxx                  xxx
Article 266-B. penalty.- 
Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.
xxxx (Emphases supplied)
The Court, however, modifies the award of exemplary damages and moral damages. In accordance with prevailing jurisprudence
[37]
 the award of exemplary damages should be increased from P30,000.00 to P75,000.00 and moral damages from P50,000.00 to P75,000.00.  On the other hand, the award of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and the grant of six percent interest on these amounts from finality of decision until fully paid are affirmed.
Accordingly, the appeal is 
DISMISSED
, and the assailed Decision dated May 27, 2015 of the Court of Appeals, 
AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION
 as heretofore stated.
ERIC DUMDUM
 is found 
GUILTY
 of 
Rape
 and sentenced to 
Reclusion Perpetua
. He is required to pay AAA P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and exemplary damages in the amount of P75,000.00.
These amounts shall earn six percent interest per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid.
