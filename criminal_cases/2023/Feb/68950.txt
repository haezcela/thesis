 Facts


 The factual findings of the Sandiganbayan
[6]
 indicate that on September 24, 1998, Public Estates Authority (
PEA
) Deputy General Manager Manuel BeriÃ±a, Jr. (
BeriÃ±a, Jr
.) and PEA General Manager Carlos Doble (
Doble
)
 submitted a Memorandum to the PEA Board regarding the construction of 
the Central Boulevard Road Project. It is a highway traversing the 
reclaimed area from Buendia Avenue to Pacific Avenue at Asiaworld City, 
spanning 5.1234 kilometers and was to have three bridges to cross over 
the drainage channels separating the islands. This project was pursuant 
to Administrative Order No. 176
[7]
 issued by former President Fidel Ramos (
President Ramos
) that created the Presidential Task Force Boulevard 2000 and former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada's (
President Estrada
)
 Memorandum dated October 16, 1998, ordering the PEA to develop and 
construct the said highway. PEA estimated the cost of the construction 
of the entire stretch to be at PHP 731,443,700.00, which already 
included a 15% price escalation.
[8]

 As the project was implemented, it appeared that some stretches of the 
highway were already covered by undertakings of PEA's Joint Venture 
partners. These other portions are covered by development agreements by 
PEA with SM, Inc., as well as with R1 Consortium/D.M. Wenceslao, Inc.
[9]
 On September 28, 1998, the PEA Board of Directors (
Old Board
) approved, in principle, the Proposed Action Plan for the construction of the Central Boulevard Project (
later renamed to President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard or PDMB
)
 where PEA will borrow PHP 1 billion from various financial institutions
 to finance the project.
[10]
 The members of the PEA Board of Directors 
during this time were the following: 
  






Frisco San Juan


- Chairman 






 Carlos Doble


- General Manager 






Carmelita de Leon-Chan


- Member






Elpidio Damaso


- Member






Daniel Dayan


- Member






Salvador Malbarosa


- Member






Leo Padilla


- Member
[11]








On April 22, 1999, San Juan updated the Office of then President Estrada, through Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora (
Executive Secretary Zamora
),
 of the steps taken by PEA regarding the construction of the PDMB 
project. Because of the importance of the project, San Juan requested 
for authority to bid and award contract packages relative to the PDMB 
through simplified public bidding. PEA was then authorized, by a 
Memorandum issued by then Executive Secretary Zamora dated July 2, 1999,
 to bid and award contracts for the PDMB project through simplified 
public bidding. On April 22, 1999, Doble likewise issued Office Order 
No. 070, series of 1999, where an 
Ad Hoc
 Committee was constituted to fast track the implementation of the Ombudsman Building and the Central Boulevard Road Project
[12]
 or the PDMB Project. The members of the Committee were:








Manuel BeriÃ±a, Jr.


- Chairman 






Theron Lacson  


- Member 






Bernardo Viray 


- Member






Ernesto Enriquez 


- Member
[13]








 On May 11, 1999, BeriÃ±a, Jr., as Chairman of the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee, wrote to the Project Director of the Department of Public Works and Highways (
DPWH
), Engr. Arturo M. Santos (
Engr. Santos
),
 requesting for a list of contractors who have inter-agency 
classification of large "B" and contractor's license classification of 
triple "AAA" with proven track records in implementing DPWH's major 
roads/bridges projects. On May 19, 1999, Engr. Santos replied and gave 
the names of 10 contractors with the foregoing qualifications. These 
contractors were W. Red Construction and Development Corp. (
W. Red
), JD Legaspi Construction (
JD Legaspi
), D.L. Cervantes Construction (
D.L. Cervantes
), Egapol Construction (
Egapol
), Tokwing Construction (
Tokwing
),
 Atlantic Erector's, Inc., Emerald Construction and Development Corp., 
D.M. Consunji Inc., Bandila Construction and Development Corp., and High
 Peak Construction and Development Corp.
[14]


 On July 8, 1999, BeriÃ±a, Jr. sent invitations for prequalification
 and to bid to W. Red, JD Legaspi, D.L. Cervantes, Egapol, and Tokwing. 
This was because the PEA 
Ad Hoc
 Committee decided to divide the 
10 contractors equally for Package 1 and Package 2. Prequalification 
documents were received until July 19, 1999. After evaluation, all 
contractors qualified for Package 1, with satisfactory performance and 
compliant with the minimum equipment requirement. BeriÃ±a, Jr. then 
informed the five prequalified bidders who were asked to submit their 
respective bids on July 26, 1999, with the pre-bid conference set on 
September 10, 1999. The bids were opened in the presence of the bidders,
 
Ad Hoc
 Committee members, and a Commission on Audit (
COA
) representative on September 16, 1999.
[15]

 The bids of the five construction companies were all considered 
responsive, with the following respective bids and a summary of the 
agency estimates set by PEA:
  






Bidders

[16]








From the submissions of the contractors, it was determined that JD Legaspi was the lowest complying bidder. The 
Ad Hoc

 Committee thereafter recommended that the project be awarded to JD 
Legaspi. The Bid Evaluation was prepared by Project Management Officer 
Jose Morales, Jr., and checked by Raphael Pocholo Zorilla (
Zorilla
), while Bernardo Viray (
Viray
), Atty. Ernesto Enriquez (
Atty. Enriquez
), Theron Victor Lacson (
Lacson
)
 and BeriÃ±a, Jr. recommended the approval thereof. Doble approved the 
same Bid Evaluation Report, which was forwarded to the PEA Board of 
Directors. In turn, the Board of Directors approved the awarding of the 
contract to JD Legaspi during its Board Meeting held on November 3, 
1999.
[17]
 Resolution No. 2032, series of 1999 states:




 RESOLVED, that the 
award
 of contract for the construction
 of the proposed Central Boulevard Road Project (Package 1) to JD 
Legaspi Construction and the appropriation of the amount of Five Hundred
 Eighty[Â­ ]Four Million Three Hundred Sixty[-]Five Thousand Eight 
Hundred Eighty[-]Five and 05/100 Peso[s] (584,365,885.05), chargeable 
against
 the 
proceeds

 of the One Billion Peso loan from Land Bank of the Philippines/All Asia
 Capital, is hereby approved, subject to pertinent accounting and 
auditing rules and regulations.
[18]
 (Emphasis supplied)




 Pursuant to the above action of the Board of Directors, a 
Construction Agreement was drawn up and signed by Doble and Legaspi. It 
was later presented to the Board of Directors, which approved the same 
on December 15, 1999. The Board of Directors' approval was for the 
Construction Agreement for Package 1 of the Central Boulevard Road 
Project executed between the PEA and JD Legaspi.
[19]
 Upon review of the Office of the President, then Executive Secretary Zamora issued a Memorandum
[20]
 dated January 29, 2000 addressed to San Juan, which provides:
  


 The request for approval by the PEA of its Construction 
Agreement with JD Legaspi Construction for the construction of the 
Central Boulevard Road Project in the amount of five hundred 
eighty[-]four million three hundred sixty[-]five thousand eight hundred 
eighty[-]five pesos and 05/100 (P584,365,885.05) is hereby granted 
subject to the following conditions:








a.)


The PEA Accountant should sign as a witness to the Agreement 






 


 






b.)


The following provisions must be added to the Agreement:






 


 


 








(i)


All the extra works and price adjustments should first be submitted to the President for approval.






 


 


 








(ii)


The fifteen percent (15%) advance 
payment to cover the mobilization expenses of the Contractor should be 
given to the latter at two staggered payments of seven and a half 
percent (7.5%) each, in compliance with CI 4 of the Implementing Rules 
and Regulations of P.D. 1594 and DPWH Ministry Order No. 42, Series of 
1984. 






 


 






c.)


Additional credit line in
 the amount of eight million four hundred thirty[-]six thousand five 
hundred eighty[-]eight pesos and 50/100 (P8,436,588.50) must be opened. 






 


 






d.)


Final approval and actual release of the loan proceeds from the Land Bank of the Philippines/ All Asia Capital must be secured.








After the compliance with the foregoing, the PEA is directed to 
issue the written Notice to Proceed. This must specifically require the 
Contractor to complete the project within three hundred sixty (360) days
 from receipt of said Notice.


 Please submit to the Office of the President, through the PMS, a
 report on the results of the transaction within thirty (30) days from 
receipt by the Contractor of the Notice to Proceed, a statement of 
commitment concerning the additional credit line opened with the bank 
concerned, a copy of the certificate of final approval and actual 
release of the loan proceeds from the Land Bank of the Philippines/All 
Asia Capital and a copy of the signed Construction Agreement, duly 
notarized, with accompanying annexes.
[21]




 Pursuant to this Memorandum, several changes were incorporated to the agreement signed beforehand by Doble and Legaspi.
[22]
 Another Construction Agreement (
Agreement
) was signed on April 10, 2000.
[23]

 As per the Agreement, the project was for PHP 584,365,885.05 inclusive 
of value added tax, fees and taxes for obtaining the necessary licenses 
and clearances from various government agencies. Other notable 
provisions of the Agreement were the following:
  


 Article 4


 4.5 
Price Escalation
: Adjustment of contract price due to
 escalation shall be effected in accordance with P.D. 1594 and its IRR, 
upon written agreement of the parties and subject to availability of 
funds.


 Article 8 
Change Order and/or Additional Work


 8.1	The 
PEA
, may at any time, by written order,
 make changes in the schedule and work required under this Agreement. If
 any such change/s causes an increase or decrease in the work or the 
time required for performing the work, an equitable adjustment shall be 
made of the contract price and completion date upon mutual agreement of 
the parties reflecting such adjustments by way of written order subject 
to the provisions of the IRR of P.D. 1594, as last amended and the 
approval of the President.


 8.2	Should the 
PEA
 find it necessary to have 
any additional work carried out for the purposes of the Project in 
addition to the contracted work, such additional work will be carried 
out immediately by the 
CONTRACTOR
 upon receiving 
written approval from the President, provided that the amount of the 
change order is within the limitations and in accordance with conditions
 set forth in P.D. 1594 and its IRR.
[24]
 (Emphasis in the original)




 The Agreement also explicitly states that the Contractor "shall 
commence prosecution of the Project within 10 calendar days from receipt
 of the Written Notice to Proceed from the PEA, and shall finish and 
complete the construction of the entire Project to PEA's satisfaction 
within 360 calendar days."
[25]

 The 15% advance payment provision, as stated in the Memorandum of the 
Executive Secretary, was likewise included. The Agreement also has a 
notation on Page II thereof, which states "Funds Available in the amount
 of PHP 300 million for Phase I only."
[26]

 Thereafter, PEA issued the Notice to Proceed dated April 10, 2000, 
giving JD Legaspi 360 calendar days for the entire project, that was to 
commence seven calendar days from receipt thereof. Said Notice to 
Proceed was stamped "Received" on April 11, 2000.
[27]
 At this point, PEA had only received PHP 300 Million from Land Bank of the Philippines (
LandBank
)
 as loan proceeds, as evidenced by the Comptroller's note on the signed 
Construction Agreement. The PEA Board of Directors also approved a loan 
from the Government Service Insurance System (
GSIS
) for PHP 600 million.
[28]


 Several Variation Orders followed the signing of the Agreement. The first of these Variation Orders (
later renamed as Variation Order No. 2
)
 was for the construction of the Seaside Drive Extension and Inland 
Channel to facilitate the flow of traffic at the Seaside Drive 
Extension, submitted by BeriÃ±a, Jr. for consideration of the Board of 
Directors on June 27, 2000. The total amount of the Variation Order as 
presented to the Board was PHP 117,454,756.71. BeriÃ±a, Jr. explained 
that the bridge must be constructed to avoid the gap between Central 
Business Park II and Central Business Park I B & C. The Memorandum 
likewise stated that the bridge was originally included in the proposed 
bidding of Package 2, which did not materialize because R1 Consortium 
merely indicated its willingness to construct the Central Boulevard at 
Central Business Park I B & C under their Joint Venture Agreement, 
but not the bridge. He thus recommended that the additional works be 
awarded to the contractor of Package 1, subject to fulfillment of 
certain conditions.
[29]
 This Variation Order was approved by the Board of Directors on July 5, 2000, subject to the conditions set forth by BeriÃ±a, Jr.
[30]
 Another Variation Order (
Variation Order No. 1
)
 was approved by the Board on January 29, 2001. It involved the 
realignment of certain items of work with no additional cost and 
additional time. Variation Order No. 1 was deemed necessary because of 
the changes in the original plans and in order to suit the actual field 
conditions. The changes were mainly on the thickness of pavement 
structures, number of layers of geotextile/geogrid materials, and the 
type of drainage system (from reinforced concrete pipe culvert to 
reinforced concrete box culvert). The effect of the Variation Order was 
considered reasonable by the COA after review, as shown by the Review 
Report later that same year.
[31]

 Then on March 21, 2001, BeriÃ±a, Jr. requested for approval of the 
revised cost of Variation Order No. 2 based on the detailed plans in the
 total amount of PHP 126,440,810.20 which includes the following works:
[32]








1.


Design and Construction of 
Bridge across the 42 m. inland channel between Central Business Park 1, B
 & C (CBP-1 B&C) and Central Business Park 2 (CBP-II) including 
the design and construction of containment walls at the approaches of 
the proposed bridge and the design and construction of the bridge 
approaches. The construction of the bridge is necessary to connect the 
Central Boulevard of CBP-1 B&C and CBP-II so that the Central 
Boulevard can be fully utilized from Buendia Extension to Asiaworld 
Property before the end of 2001.














2.


Design and construction of the Seaside 
Drive extension that will serve as an access to Roxas Boulevard and 
Seaside Drive going to the National Airport (NAIA).
[33]








The additional quantities for earthwork excavation, embankment, 
disposal of unsuitable materials and geotextile/geogrid materials, which
 resulted to the increase in the amount for Variation Order No. 2, was 
approved by the Board of Directors on June 29, 2001. Nevertheless, it 
was already on July 19, 2002 when PEA issued the Notice to Proceed for 
Variation Order No. 2.
[34]


 It would appear that on April 3, 2001, Jaime R. Millan (
Millan
)
 recommended the grant of time extension to JD Legaspi until the balance
 of the PHP 1 billion loan was secured. This was on account of JD 
Legaspi's letter to PEA on January 16, 2001, which was received on March
 12, 2001, requesting for a time suspension effective January 15, 2001 
due to unavailability of funds. The same time suspension was lifted 
effective June 14, 2002.
[35]

 In the meantime, there were substantial changes in the composition of 
the Board of Directors of PEA. Between March and July 2001, new members 
of the board came in, giving rise to a different set of directors. From 
thereon, the Board of Directors consisted of the following:
  






Ernest F.O. Villareal 


-Chairman






Benjamin CariÃ±o


-General Manager






Joemari Gerochi 


-Member






Sulficio Tagud, Jr. 


-Member






Angelito Villanueva 


-Member






Rodolfo Tuazon 


-Member






Martin Sarciego, Jr.


-Member
[36]








    Then, on July 24, 2001, JD Legaspi requested for a price adjustment based on Section Instruction to Bidders (
IB
) 10.10 of the Implementing Rules and Regulation
[37]
 (
IRR
) of Presidential Decree (
P.D
.) No. 1594
[38]
,
 amounting to PHP 45,811,510.32. The request sent by JD Legaspi was 
forwarded by Millan to CariÃ±o for the latter's consideration on August 
24, 2001. The Internal Memo was noted by CariÃ±o "Ask for COA approval of
 the adjusted unit prices prior to payment." The said request was 
endorsed to the Board of Directors by BeriÃ±a, Jr. through a Memorandum 
dated October 24, 2001.
[39]


 During the meeting of the Board of Directors held on November 6, 
2001, they approved the request of JD Legaspi but lowered the contract 
price adjustment to PHP 42,418,493.64, which was 7.26% of the contract 
amount. Then, during the December 5, 2001 meeting of the Board of 
Directors, Tagud questioned the authority of PEA Management to approve 
the price adjustment. The PEA Management was then directed to verify if 
the subject contract price adjustment was within the approval limits of 
management. In the following Board Meeting on December 14, 2001, BeriÃ±a,
 Jr. explained the process of dealing with price adjustments and 
escalations, with the former taking effect if the Notice to Proceed was 
issued after 120 calendar days from the bidding date. The Board 
eventually decided to defer discussion on the matter until justification
 was forwarded to them.
[40]

 The matter was not brought up until BeriÃ±a, Jr. sent a Memorandum dated
 April 16, 2002 to the Board, requesting for confirmation of the 
contract price adjustment. In its Price Adjustment Review Report, the 
COA deemed the price adjustment reasonable. The COA Report was 
eventually relayed to PEA by De la Paz and the price adjustment was 
finally approved on April 19, 2002, through Resolution No. 3203, series 
of 2002, which also provides that the same is chargeable to the proceeds
 of the PHP 1 billion loan with the GSIS, and will only be due and 
demandable when the loan proceeds are released to PEA.
[41]

 Near the tail end of the project, BeriÃ±a, Jr. requested the Board of 
Directors to confirm Variation Order Nos. 3, 4 and 5 for the President 
Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard, to be chargeable against the GSIS loan 
secured for the purpose. Variation Order No. 3 is for landscaping works 
of the Central Boulevard amounting to PHP 13,357,005.00, No. 4 is for 
additional items of work amounting to PHP 4,759,630.80, and No. 5 is for
 landscaping work of the Seaside Drive amounting to PHP 1,244,949.00.
[42]

  Finally, BeriÃ±a, Jr. requested confirmation and appropriation of funds
 from the Board of Directors for the Overrun/Underrun quantities or 
costs of Items of work of the PDMB Road Project Package 1 due to the 
disparity between the Bid Plans (
preconstruction plans
) and the
 approved construction plans, and actual works accomplished to suit 
actual field conditions. The Memorandum signed by BeriÃ±a, Jr. includes 
the following table summarizing the amounts of overruns:

			 			 The same Memorandum contained a request to enter into a 
Supplemental Agreement with JD Legaspi on the Overrun/Underrun 
quantities that exceeded 25% of the original contract quantities/costs 
per items of work, amounting to PHP 57,031,012.96.
[45]
 


 On August 13, 2002, the Board of Directors confirmed and approved 
Variation Order No. 4 and the Final Bill of Quantities 
(Overruns/Underruns) in the amount of PHP 4,759,630.80 and the amount of
 PHP 79,332,524.08 through Resolution No. 3272, series of 2002. The 
Resolution also authorized PEA Management to enter into a Supplemental 
Agreement with JD Legaspi for quantities exceeding 25% of the original 
contract quantities or costs per items of work. On August 22, 2002, a 
Supplemental Agreement was then entered into by PEA, then represented by
 CariÃ±o and JD Legaspi, where PEA agreed to pay JD Legaspi for the 
faithful and satisfactory performance of the additional works stipulated
 in Variation Order No. 1 and the works required to complete the Seaside
 Drive Extension and the bridge at the 42-meter Inland Channel. The 
contract was priced at PHP 57,031,012.96.
[46]
 

 These Internal Memoranda requesting approvals for Variation Orders were
 sent to the General Manager (CariÃ±o in most cases, since these were 
made in the implementation stage of the Agreement) by Millan, with 
BeriÃ±a, Jr. recommending the approval thereof.
[47]
  The PDMB was inaugurated on April 5, 2002 and was eventually opened to the public on July 15, 2002.
[48]

 In 2003, a Subsoil Assessment Report was commissioned by the Senate of 
the Philippines. It was found that the subsoil was characterized by fill
 materials predominantly consisting of sands with silts and clays and 
with traces of gravels, but the same was based on subsurface 
investigation data from the four boreholes and the four test pits only. 
The body that conducted			 the assessment also commented that the soil 
stratification on other locations along the alignment may differ from 
those mentioned in the report. Further tests were conducted later that 
year, and it was concluded that additional borehole drilling results 
were consistent with the initial findings, that is, materials were 
considered suitable fill materials and that the in-place embankment	
materials	of the reclaimed	site were suitable	based		on provisions of		
the DPWH	Standard	Specifications	for	Highways	and Bridges.
[49]


  The issue of overpricing on the PDMB project eventually broke
 out and a Senate investigation was commenced. Because of this, PEA 
denied the request of JD Legaspi for payment on October 13, 2003 and 
October 11, 2004. Thereafter, JD Legaspi was compelled to file a case 
for Specific Performance, which was decided in its favor on January 10, 
2007. On December 5, 2007, PEA, now Philippine Reclamation Authority (
PRA
)	  entered into a Compromise Agreement with JD Legaspi for the payment of	 the 13
th

 Progress Billing for the PDMB in the amount of PHP 27,471,322.84, 
attorney's fees of PHP 100,000.00, and interest of PHP 4,593,117.48. The
 said Compromise Agreement was approved by Branch 148 of the Regional 
Trial Court of Makati City, where JD Legaspi filed the case demanding 
payment for the unpaid portion of the Progress Billings submitted to 
PEA.
[50]
 All in all, 
the total amount received by JD Legaspi was PHP 839,312,471.47. The 
total amount of the variation orders amounted to PHP 145,802,395.00 or 
24.95% of the total contract amount. The amounts received by JD Legaspi

On June 6, 2003, an Information
[53]
 was filed with the Sandiganbayan charging
 inter alia
,
 the members of the Old PEA Board, the members of the new PEA Board, the
 PEA Management, JD Legaspi, and auditors of the COA for violation of 
Section 3(e) of Republic Act (
R.A
.) No. 3019,
[54]
 allegedly committed as follows:




 That in or about the period from April 1999 to August 2002, in 
Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
 Court, accused public officials of the Public Estates Authority (PEA), 
namely: CARLOS P. DOBLE, former General Manager (with Salary Grade 30) 
and 
ex-oficio
 member of the PEA Board, BENJAMIN V. CARIÃO, PEA General Manager (with Salary Grade 30) and 
ex-oficio

 member of the Board, and other responsible public officials of PEA, 
namely: FRISCO FRANSICO SAN JUAN, former Chairman of the Board, 
CARMELITA DE LEON-CHAN, DANIEL T. DAYAN, SALVADOR P. MALBAROSA, LEO V. 
PADILLA and ELPIDIO G. DAMASO, all former members of the Board, ERNEST 
FREDERICK O. VILLAREAL, Chairman of the Board, and JOEMARI D. GEROCHI, 
ANGELITO M. VILLANUEVA, MARTIN S. SANCIEGO, JR., and RODOLFO T. TUAZON, 
all Board members, JAIME R. MILLAN, Assistant General Manager, MANUEL R.
 BERIÃA, JR., Deputy General Manager for Operations & Technical 
Services and Chairman of the 
Ad Hoc Committee
 responsible for the
 bidding and award of the construction contract for the President 
Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard Project, THERON VICTOR V. LACSON, Deputy 
General Manager for Finance, Legal and Administration and member of the 
Ad Hoc Committee
, BERNARDO T. VIRAY, Manager for Technical Services Department and member of the 
Ad Hoc Committee
, RAPHAEL POCHOLO A. ZORILLA, Project Management Officer, ERNESTO L. ENRIQUEZ, Senior Corporate Attorney and member of the 
Ad Hoc Committee
,
 and CRISTINA AMPOSTA-MORTEL, Department Manager, Legal Department, and 
other responsible public officials of the Commission on Audit (COA), 
namely: MANUELA E. DELA PAZ, State Auditor V, ARTURO S. LAYUG, State 
Auditor V and Chief of Technical Services Audit Division A, Technical 
Services Offices, BENILDA E. MENDOZA, Supervising Technical Audit, 
EPIFANIO L. PUREZA, Assistant Chief of the Technical Services Audit 
Division A, JOSE G. CAPISTRANO, Technical Audit Specialist II, and MA. 
CECILIA A. DELA RAMA, Technical Audit Specialist I, all of whom were 
public officials during the times material to the subject offense, while
 said public officials were occupying their respective positions as just
 stated, acting in such capacity and committing the subject offense in 
relation to office and while in the performance of their functions and 
duties, with manifest partiality and evident bad faith (or at the very 
least, gross inexcusable			negligence),		conspiring	and		confederating		
with accused JESUSITO D. LEGASPI, a private contractor doing business 
under the name of JD Legaspi Construction, did then and there, 
willfully, unlawfully and criminally give unwarranted benefits, 
advantage and preference to accused JESUSITO D. LEGASPI, through the 
commission of numerous illegal related acts all pertaining to the 
President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard Project, such as (but not limited
 to) the bidding out of the said project and illegally awarding the same
 to accused JESUSITO D. LEGASPI's JD Legaspi Construction and approving 
the award of the project to, as well as the 
Construction Agreement

 with, JD Legaspi Construction despite the lack of compliance with the 
mandatory requirements and procedure for bidding, even if no funds are 
yet available to finance the project, without the requisite certificate 
of availability of funds and without complying with the mandatory 
conditions imposed by the Office of the President for the approval 
thereof, per Memorandum dated 29 January 2000 from	the		Office	 of	the	
Executive	Secretary,	MalacaÃ±ang,	and approving/allowing several improper
 variation/change orders and overruns to be implemented without the 
requisite presidential approval and the appropriate funds, recognizing, 
affirming and causing the implementation of the just-mentioned void 
contract, allowing and paying or causing the allowance and payment of 
several claims of accused JESUSITO D. LEGASPI for initial contract 
price, contract price adjustment, variation orders, overruns and other 
claims even when the same were clearly improper, illegal and without the
 requisite presidential approval, thereby paving the way for accused 
JESUSITO D. LEGASPI to claim and receive undue payments from the 
Government totalling millions of pesos in improper overprice, thereby 
causing undue injury and grave damage to the government in the aggregate
 amount of at least 
FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY	TWO	MILLION	NINE	 HUNDRED	TWENTY-SIX THOUSAND		FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY	AND 39/100 PESOS (P532,926,420.39)
, more or less, constituting the total illegal overprice paid to accused JESUSITO D. LEGASPI for the subject Project.


 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[55]
 (Emphasis in the original)




 Consequently, warrants of arrest were issued against the accused 
on June 27, 2003. Villareal, San Juan, and Doble filed their cash bonds 
with the Sandiganbayan while Zorilla, Lacson, Viray, BeriÃ±a Jr., and 
Millan posted their surety bonds. After their respective Motion for 
Reduction of Bail was granted, Pureza, Capistrano, De la Rama, Mendoza, 
and De la Paz likewise posted their cash bonds with the Sandiganbayan.
[56]

 The accused were arraigned on various dates and entered their 
respective pleas. On July 24, 2003, Villanueva was arraigned and he 
entered a plea of not guilty. Then, on January 21, 2005, Malbarosa, San 
Juan, Tuazon, Chan, Damaso, Legaspi, Dayan, BeriÃ±a, Jr., Millan, 
Zorilla, Viray, Gerochi, CariÃ±o, and Amposta-Mortel refused to enter a 
plea. On February 15, 2005, Villareal, Padilla, and Lacson refused to 
enter a plea. On February 24, 2005, Doble did not enter a plea. Lastly, 
on March 10, 2005, Layug, Pureza and Capistrano refused to enter a plea.
 Consequently, this Court entered a plea of not guilty for those who 
refused to enter a plea.
[57]
 After due proceedings, the Sandiganbayan rendered the assailed Decision dated February 5, 2015.
 Sandiganbayan Decision

 In convicting petitioners for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 
3019, the Sandiganbayan found that the procedures for simplified bidding
 of a flagship project were not followed. Under IB 10.4.2.5, IRR of P.D.
 No. 1594, as amended, the participants for such project must be limited
 to 
bona fide 
contractors duly accredited and classified for 
the project category and size, and who are included in a separate 
masterlist to be prepared by the Philippine Contractors Accreditation 
Board (
PCAB
).
[58]
 
However, instead of complying with this requirement, PEA elected to 
limit its shortlisted bidders to only 10 contractors who were listed in 
the roster prepared by the DPWH. PEA did this in spite of the fact that 
the "Invitation to Contractors" clearly stated that PEA invited bids 
from contractors who were included in the PCAB masterlist.
[59]

 JD Legaspi, it appears, had a PCAB license as a Large "B" contractor. 
The records and evidence however, do not show that the other nine 
contractors in the DPWH list had valid PCAB licenses at the time of the 
bidding.
[60]


 Likewise, PEA divided the PDMB project into Package 1 and 
Package 2, for purposes of the simplified bidding without rational 
basis, as it merely chose the first five contractors in the DPWH list 
for the Package 1 bidding and the other half for Package 2. Package 1 
covered the PDMB project consisting of that portion awarded to JD 
Legaspi. Package 2 consisted of the portion of the Central Boulevard in 
which PEA had a prior joint venture agreement with SM and R1 Consortium 
wherein the latter two developers had the option to construct, in 
exchange for land or bonds, their respective portions. Thus, those 
contractors for the Package 2 bidding were, from the start, 
disadvantaged on account of the great possibility that Package 2 could 
not be bid out because of the option given to SM and R1 Consortium. In 
turn, those contractors that were assigned for Package 1 were favored by
 PEA's arbitrary decision. This is because by just being listed ahead in
 the DPWH list, they were certain to be able to bid and, in the case of 
JD Legaspi, win the award for Package 1. This alone gave undue advantage
 to the first set of contractors and prejudiced the second set.
[61]

 JD Legaspi, which was second on the DPWH list, therefore gained an 
advantage or benefit, as it was able to bid and win Package 1, to the 
disadvantage of those contractors in the second set of the DPWH list and
 also those PCAB-accredited contractors in the latter's masterlist, who 
were not included in the DPWH list.
[62]

 The Sandiganbayan likewise found the lack of detailed engineering 
requirements, which must be submitted before any bidding. While BeriÃ±a, 
Jr. and Millan claimed that the project awarded to JD Legaspi was a 
design and build contract, the approved agency estimate did not include 
the design cost, which was pegged by PEA at PHP 13.5 million. Thus, the 
design plans should have been done before any bidding in order to arrive
 at an approved agency estimate. As part of the detailed engineering 
requirement, there should have been definitive soil foundation and 
investigation results for purposes of bidding. Furthermore, design was 
not mentioned in the scope of works in the Construction Agreement and 
Invitation to Bid in the award of the project to JD Legaspi. This was 
what PEA did with respect to its contract with R1 Consortium in 
connection with the Roxas Canal West Bridge, which is part of the 
Central Boulevard project. This was not however present in the contract 
with JD Legaspi.
[63]
 
The Sandiganbayan also cited the Government Auditing Code that 
proscribes the making of any contract involving the expenditure of 
public funds unless there is an appropriation therefor.
[64]

 In this case, PEA, at the time when the PDMB project was bid out, only 
provided a Board Resolution identifying the source of the fund. PEA 
hoped to secure loans in the amount of PHP 1 billion to finance the 
project. When the PEA Board approved the award of the contract to JD 
Legaspi on November 3, 1999, it identified the source of the PHP 
584,365,885.05 cost of the project to be the PHP 1 billion loan facility
 from the Landbank/All Asia Capital group. However, the said loan was 
yet inexistent as it was still under negotiation at the time.
[65]

 Further, at the time the JD Legaspi contract was signed, dated and 
notarized on April 10, 2000, only the amount of PHP 300 million was 
actually released and available from the proceeds of the Landbank loan. 
This was found to be in open defiance of one of the conditions imposed 
by the Office of the President that approval of the JD Legaspi contract 
should be preceded by "final approval and release of the loan proceeds 
from the Landbank and All Asia Capital."
[66]

 The PEA Management even divided the contract into two phases: Phase I 
for works corresponding to the PHP 300 million available funds and Phase
 II covering the remaining works of the entire project. In the executed 
contract, however, it was clear that Phase II could be undertaken only 
if and when funds are made available again. This explicitly recognized 
and admitted that PEA did not have enough funds to finance the JD 
Legaspi contract at the time of its execution.
[67]
 

 The result was that PEA ran out of funds and could not pursue, as 
scheduled, the remaining works left to be funded. The PHP 300 million 
initial funds were depleted by October 15, 2000. Naturally, JD Legaspi 
filed a notice of suspension of work as his claims for payment could not
 be funded. PEA, thus, issued a Suspension of Work Order effective 
January 15, 2001, which was only lifted on June 14, 2002.
[68]
 

 Moreover, despite only having PHP 300 million initial funds for Phase I
 of the project, BeriÃ±a, Jr. recommended as early as July 5, 2000, or 
barely three months after the notice to proceed was issued to JD 
Legaspi, that the PEA Board approve Variation Order No. 2 consisting of 
the construction of the Inland Channel Bridge and the Seaside Drive 
Extension with a final cost of around PHP 126 million. These additional 
works were not part of JD Legaspi's original contract.
[69]

 PEA also violated the requirement that all extra works and price 
adjustments should be first submitted to the President for approval.
[70]

 While PEA contended that this requirement only applied to extra work 
and not works for variation orders, the Sandiganbayan found that the 
requirement covered any kind of price adjustment, and not only those 
related to variation orders. This is because a variation order for 
additional work necessarily carries with it a price adjustment, and 
presidential approval of the Variation Order will implicitly carry 
approval of the price adjustment.
[71]

 JD Legaspi was thereafter paid the amount of PHP 42,418,493.64 because 
of a contract price adjustment due to the late issuance of the Notice to
 Proceed, after the date of bidding. The Sandiganbayan found that no 
presidential approval was secured for this price adjustment, with PEA 
contending that only price adjustments arising from change orders had to
 be priorly approved.
[72]
 By 
the terms of the Construction Agreement, however, PEA had to secure the 
OP's approval for any Variation/Change Order. As the Sandiganbayan 
declared, the contract was the law between the parties, binding on both 
of them.
[73]
  Further, 
the Seaside Drive Extension under Variation Order No. 2 cannot legally 
qualify to be covered by a variation order because it was a road outside
 of the PDMB project and nowhere along the original PDMB roadway plan. 
It was, in fact, a roadway connecting PDMB and Roxas Boulevard.
[74]

 As it was not part of the PDMB project, it could not legally be a 
variation order or a change order. PEA should have taken steps to 
include this road in the bidding for the PDMB project. As such, the 
Seaside Drive Extension that entailed a total cost of PHP 57,598,301.10 
should have been bid out.
[75]

 Overall, the Sandiganbayan found the JD Legaspi contract to be 
overpriced. It held that overpricing should not be hinged on whether the
 cost of materials and labor, on a unit price basis, greatly exceeded 
the total contract price of PHP 584 million. Overpricing may also come 
into play when payments to a contractor are made beyond the total 
contract price arising out of irregular or unauthorized contract price 
adjustments and variation/change orders.
[76]

 The overpriced amount, which comprised the adjustments in the amount of
 PHP 42,418,493.64 and the cost of the Seaside Drive Extension in the 
adjusted amount of PHP 57,598,301.10, total to PHP 100,016,794.74 that 
were paid to JD Legaspi.
[77]
  The liability of the petitioners was then described as follows:
  


 Liability of BeriÃ±a, Jr., Lacson, Millan, Viray and Zorilla (Members of PEA Management)


 Through their various positions, Millan and BeriÃ±a[, Jr.] and the other members of the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee, Lacson and Viray, clearly had the duty to be involved in the
 planning and execution of all PEA Projects, including the PDMB project 
and to ensure that the same complied with the law . . . their actions 
[however caused] damage to the government by awarding the PDMB project 
to Legaspi and paving the way for the approval of the price adjustment, 
variation orders and final bill of quantities despite the legal 
infirmities of the same.
[78]
 Accused Zorilla, despite not being [a	,  member of the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee, cannot be said to be without fault.] He prepared the 
Approved Agency Estimate for the PDMB project despite the lack of a 
detailed engineering . . . As per the law and common sense, a detailed 
engineering is a crucial part of formulating an Approved Agency 
Estimate.
[79]
 (Emphasis in the original)


 Liability of Amposta-Mortel


 Amposta-Mortel . . . was the Department Manager of the Legal Department of PEA
[80]

 . . . and was to act as the legal adviser and therefore render advisory
 or legal opinion. It is incumbent upon her to recommend, draft and 
approve legal instruments involving PEA.
[81]

 . . . [S]he herself was aware that there were not enough funds to cover
 the transaction. [T]hough she allegedly went over the initial 
Construction Agreement, as shown by her signature, her findings on the 
legality of its provisions or the compliance of PEA with the conditions 
imposed by the Office of the President were conspicuously absent, which 
only goes to show that either she purposely failed to do her job to 
review the contract, or she was negligent in her duties. Her argument 
that she only reviews matters which are brought to her attention showed 
her lackadaisical attitude towards her duties as Manager of the Legal 
Department.
[82]


 Liability of San Juan, Chan, Dayan, Malbarosa, Padilla, and Damaso (Members of the Old Board of Directors) 


 All the members of the Old Board are liable for the following: 






1.


Resolution No. 2032 dated 
November 3, 1999, approving the award of the contract to [JD] Legaspi, 
despite the absence of any appropriation or actual loan proceeds from 
Landbank/All Asia Capital. 






 


 






2.


Resolution No. 2057 dated December 15, 
1999, covering the approval of the construction agreement despite 
insufficient funding. This resulted in PEA's inability to issue a notice
 to proceed within 120 days from bidding date, thus, enabling [JD] 
Legaspi to claim the contract price adjustment of over [PHP] 42 million.
 






 


 






3.


Resolution No. 3017 dated July 5, 2000,
 approval of Variation Order No. 1 (later renumbered as Variation Order 
No. 2 under Resolution No. 3102), for lack of bidding on the Seaside 
Drive Extension which cannot be considered germane to the JD Legaspi 
agreement, the same not being part and parcel of the original Package 1 
project. 






 


 






4.


Resolution No. 3102 dated April 26, 
2001, in relation to Resolution No. 3017, allowing an increase on the 
cost of Variation Order No. 2, which included the Seaside Drive 
Extension.
[83]








As to Villareal, Gerochi, Villanueva,		Sanciego, Jr., and Tuazon 
(members of the new Board of Directors), they assumed their duties 
between March	and	July	2001	when	the PDMB	project	was	already	under  
construction.
[84]
 Unlike the 
Old Board, the new Board no longer had the opportunity	to question	the 
award	and approval	of the Construction Agreement with JD Legaspi.
[85]

 While the contract price adjustment of more than PHP 42 million was 
irregular, the new Board's confirmation of the same cannot be taken as a
 conspiratorial act on their part. The claim of Legaspi was an offshoot 
of the belated issuance of the Notice to Proceed which was partly caused
 by PEA's inability to secure total funding for the PDMB project. Thus, 
the new Board	had nothing to do with these deficiencies.
[86]


 With respect to Dela Paz, Layug, Mendoza, Pureza, Capistrano, and 
De la Rama (officers of the COA), their roles were limited to 
post-audit.
[87]
 Moreover, the 
findings of COA officials that the total project cost, including the 
price adjustments, was reasonable and not overpriced were affirmed by 
subsequent COA Special Audit Report.
[88]

 De la Paz failed to consider that even as an observer, she should have 
noted and included in her report that the contract for the project was 
awarded to JD Legaspi even before the funds for the project was 
available. Nevertheless, such negligence, by itself, does not prove 
conspiracy with JD Legaspi. Given that she referred the contract and 
variation orders to the Technical Services Office and gathered positive 
findings from the same, it can be said that she fulfilled her duties 
albeit to a less than ideal degree.
[89]
 As to JD Legaspi, the Sandiganbayan found no conspiracy in the award of the PDMB Project.
[90]

 However, as to the contract for the Seaside Drive Extension, it found 
that Legaspi pushed for the variation order, which was not part of the 
original contract and claimed for overruns that resulted into the final 
bill for the project that is 43% higher than the original contract 
price. PEA Management would not have presented the same to the Old Board
 had JD Legaspi not submitted documents pertaining to the possibility of
 constructing the same as a change order to the original Construction 
Agreement, thereby violating all the public bidding rules already in 
place.
[91]
 Further, the
 Construction Agreement obligated JD Legaspi to carry out additional 
work only upon receiving written approval from the President. However, 
despite the lack of this written approval, JD Legaspi started and 
finished Variation Order No. 2. The Notice to Proceed for Variation 
Order No. 2 was issued only on July 19, 2002 but the project was 
allegedly finished sometime in July 2002 and was opened to the public on
 July 15, 2002.
[92]
 Those found liable for violation of R.A. No. 3019 were also found civilly liable for the amount of PHP 100,016,794.74.
[93]
 Several motions for reconsideration were filed, which were resolved by the Sandiganbayan in its Joint Resolution
[94]

 dated September 16, 2015. In this Resolution, the Sandiganbayan 
maintained its findings of criminal liability but increased the civil 
liability of the members of the Old Board and PEA Management to include 
the overruns of Variation Order No. 1 amounting to PHP 67,982,609.07,
[95]

 involving changes mainly on the thickness of pavement structures, 
number of layers of geotextile/geogrid materials, and the type of 
drainage system (from reinforced concrete pipe culvert to reinforced 
concrete box culvert).
[96]
 The
 Sandiganbayan also included the overruns for the Inland Channel Bridge 
under Variation Order No. 2 in the amount of PHP 5,441,470.39.
[97]
 There was thus an additional civil liability in the amount of PHP 73,424,079.46
[98]
 and the total civil liability was increased to PHP 173,440,874.20.
[99]

  These were included because the extra quantities claimed by JD Legaspi
 as overruns were actually foreseeable and determinable had there been a
 detailed engineering before the PDMB project was bid out. Part of the 
detailed engineering activities is soil and foundation investigation.
[100]
 They are not in the nature of conditions that are not known or cannot be predicted at the time the quantities are prepared.
[101]

 The additional amount cannot however be charged against JD Legaspi 
since detailed engineering is a requirement prior to bidding. The guilt 
of JD Legaspi was limited only to the Seaside Drive Extension where this
 Court found an implied conspiracy.
[102]

  On the other hand, the Inland Channel Bridge is differently situated 
from the Seaside Drive Extension, although both were claimed by JD 
Legaspi and approved by the Board under Variation Order No. 2. The 
Inland Channel Bridge was necessary because without it, the PDMB Project
 would be useless as there would be a gap between the segment built by 
JD Legaspi and R1 Consortium unlike the Seaside Drive Extension that was
 outside the PDMB project.
[103]
 The civil liability of JD Legaspi was then limited to the Seaside Drive Extension in the amount of PHP 57,598,301.10.
[104]
  Hence, the instant Petition.
 Issues


 The common issues brought forth by petitioners are as follows: 
  


I. 


Whether	the	Sandiganbayan	erred in	finding petitioners		guilty	
beyond	reasonable doubt for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 


 II. 


Whether Amposta-Mortel and the members of the Old Board of PEA 
and the PEA management should be held civilly liable in the amount of 
PHP 173,440,874.20 for the irregularities that accompanied the 
construction of the PDMB Project


 III.


 Whether JD Legaspi should be held civilly liable
 to pay the amount of PHP 57,598,301.10 for the construction of the 
Seaside Drive Extension under Variation Order No. 2




 Pertinent arguments raised by petitioners are as follows:
 G.R. No. 220500

 Amposta-Mortel argues that while one of her functions is to direct the 
preparation and review of all contracts and other legal instruments to 
which PEA is a party, there are some unwritten rules and policies that 
her office has been practicing even before her assumption to office as 
Head of Legal Department. She explained that the General Manager of PEA 
is clothed with power and prerogatives to decide and appoint individuals
 to whom he would like to assist him with the projects. Thus, he created
 an 
Ad Hoc
 Committee for this particular project.
[105]
  In turn, the actions of the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee were submitted to the PEA General Manager and approved by the
 Governing Board and the Office of the President. Amposta-Mortel claimed
 that there was no directive on the part of the lawyer assigned in the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee, Atty. Enriquez, to submit the contract to the Legal 
Department, which she heads, for her review before it was made part of 
the bid documents and before it was approved by the Board.
[106]
 

 Moreover, at the time when Amposta-Mortel was called upon to review the
 written contract, the PDMB project was already a done deal. The 
contract has been previously signed by Doble, in his capacity as the 
General Manager of PEA, and Jesusito Legaspi, as owner of JD Legaspi, 
the winning contractor, albeit it was submitted for review to the Office
 of the President and the Office Government Corporate Counsel (
OGCC
).
[107]

 With respect to the availability of funds, Amposta-Mortel argued that 
she relied on Board Resolution No. 2032, series of 1999, which stated 
that the contract amount needed for the project is chargeable against 
the proceeds of the PHP 1 billion loan from LandBank/All Asia Capital. 
However, she was not aware how much was the actual available funds for 
the project at the time she affixed her initials in the contract.
[108]
 

 As to the variation orders and other requests for payments that were 
submitted and approved after the execution of the contract and during 
the implementation of the project, it was only Variation Order No. 1, 
which entailed additional works to the Central Boulevard at no 
additional costs, that was referred to her for review. Even then, she 
gave her legal opinion that Variation Order No. 1, even if it does not 
entail additional costs, would have to be submitted for approval to the 
Office of the President pursuant to the conditions imposed by the said 
Office.
[109]
 
 Amposta-Mortel insists that she is not a member of the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee tasked to implement the project and did not have a hand in its creation. All actions of the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee were submitted to the General Manager without having been 
referred to her for legal opinion. Moreover, she reviewed the 
Construction Agreement after the same had undergone separate reviews by 
the OGCC and the Office of the President, and only after the General 
Manager asked her to do so before the parties signed the same anew.
[110]

 She also cited the Decision dated May 30, 2008 rendered by the Office 
of the Ombudsman, where she was absolved from administrative liability 
based on the same allegations in the criminal complaint subject of the 
instant petition.
[111]
 G.R. No. 220504

 On the part of Lacson, he argues that in rendering its Decision, the 
Sandiganbayan relied heavily on the pieces of evidence presented by the 
prosecution and thereafter found him guilty because he was a member of 
the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee, which recommended the award of the project to JD Legaspi after a series of due diligence all in pursuance to law.
[112]
 

 Lacson claims that he did not participate in the preparation of the 
minutes or the deliberation on the approval of various resolutions. 
Further, the prosecution's witness, Atty. Karen Villamil,
[113]

 stressed on re-cross examination that Lacson, who is part of 
management, has not signed any memoranda directing the Board to act on 
anything or to issue a resolution.
[114]
  Lacson argues that he simply performed his duties as a member of the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee. He signed the Abstract of Bids attesting to the results of 
the bidding, which was likewise signed by the COA representative. Also, 
he signed the Bid Evaluation Report that described the bidding process; 
the request to the DPWH for a list of qualified contractors for roads 
and bridges with large "B" and triple "AAA" license category; the pre- 
and post-qualification evaluation report of bidders; and the 
recommendation to award the PDMB Project to JD Legaspi as the lowest 
complying bid pursuant to P.D. No. 1594 and its IRR. The recommendation 
was approved by the General Manager, and attached it to a memorandum to 
the Board, which likewise approved the same. After all of the foregoing 
and at that point in time, the functions and responsibilities of Lacson 
in the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee have ceased to exist.
[115]
 

 Lacson further explained that in compliance with the requirement to 
source participants	in a "simplified public bidding" from the separate 
masterlist to be prepared by the PCAB, Atty. Enriquez, a member of the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee, reported that this "separate masterlist" was not yet 
available then. Instead, he was furnished with a copy of a general 
masterlist of PCAB in the NCR containing hundreds of listed contractors 
with their respective PCAB category/license.
[116]

 The problem then was how to narrow down the list of pre-qualified 
bidders to achieve the objective of conducting a "simplified public 
bidding" as approved by the Office of the President. To use the general 
masterlist obtained by Atty. Enriquez could be unwieldy and militate 
against the presidential instructions to immediately have the PDMB 
Project available to the public. Hence, the Chairman of the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee decided to seek the help of the DPWH for a list of PCAB 
contractors with large "B," triple "AAA" category/license for roads and 
bridges since this is the nature of the PDMB Project.
[117]

 Moreover, the COA gave its clearance to the PDMB original contract 
price of PHP 584 million, and considered it reasonable. This means that 
the approved agency estimate, which was derived from the bid plans, 
including the detailed engineering component, was quite reasonable and 
accurate. One cannot have an acceptable approved agency estimate without
 a sufficiently detailed engineering. Furthermore, the clustering of the
 five responsive bids within the allowable thresholds or range of values
 prescribed in the implementing rules of P.D. No. 1594 shows that the 
requirement of detailed engineering was substantially complied with.
[118]

 With respect to the issue of funding, Lacson argues that the provisions
 of P.D. No. 1594 and its IRR state that in the process of bidding and 
recommending award for the project, it is merely required to pinpoint 
the source of funding. This was complied with under Board Resolution No.
 1895, series of September 28, 1998 approving the PDMB project and 
pinpointing its source of funding, i.e., PHP 1 billion loan from 
financial institutions, which the General Manager was authorized to 
negotiate. This was followed by Board Resolution No. 1959, series of 
1999 when the Board approved	the terms	and	conditions	of the above	
loan/security	from, LandBank/ All Asia Capital as Financial Advisor and 
Arranger on April 5, 1999. The above documents were already in existence
 before the creation of the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee in April 1999.
[119]

 Lacson further claims that he has nothing to do with Variation Order 
No. 2. There is no evidence, either testimonial or documentary 
presented, wherein he participated, discussed, endorsed or even 
initialed or signed any notes or memorandum recommending the approval of
 Variation Order No. 2 to the Board. All the prosecution witnesses, as 
well as the defense witnesses, including their respective documents have
 never even hinted of Lacson's involvement in such matters as price 
adjustment, Variation Order Nos. 1 to 5, price	escalation,	extra	works,	
charge	orders,	bill	of	quantities, overruns/underruns, etc. After all, 
Lacson is a non-technical or non-engineering person who does not possess
 the expertise or training in infrastructure	contract	implementation.	
Most	important,		the		
Ad	Hoc
 Committee ceased to exist after 
the recommendation was made. Variation Order No. 2 was agreed when 
Lacson's participation in the PDMB Project became nil.
[120]
 G.R. Nos. 220505, 220552, 220568, 220580 & 220592

 As to the liability of the members of the Old PEA Board, the 
Sandiganbayan found them criminally liable for violation of Section 3(e)
 of R.A. No. 3019, holding that their acts constitute gross negligence, 
characterized by the want of even slight care, in reference to passing 
the following Board Resolutions: 
  


 a.	Resolution No. 2032 dated 3 November 1999, approving the award of the contract to [JD] Legaspi Construction; 


 b.	Resolution No. 2057 dated 15 December 1999, covering the approval of the construction agreement; 


 c.	Resolution No. 3017 dated 5 July 2000, approving Variation 
Order No. l (later renumbered as Variation Order No. 2 under Resolution 
No. 3102); and


 d.	Resolution No. 3102 dated 26 April 2001, approving the increase in the cost of Variation Order No. 2.
[121]




  The members of the Old PEA Board argue that preceding the 
approval of Resolution No. 2032 dated November 3, 1999 is no less than 
two Administrative Orders (Nos. 176 and 224) and a Presidential 
Memorandum dated October 16, 1998 on prioritizing Boulevard 2000 as a 
flagship project. They claim that as far back as September 28, 1998, 
they simply directed the PEA Management to seek financing for the road 
construction project; and on April 22, 1999, to request the Office of 
the President for authority to conduct simplified public bidding, which 
request was found meritorious and thus granted by the said Office.
[122]

  Even before the questioned award of the contract to JD Legaspi under 
Board Resolution No. 2032 was passed, the members of the Old PEA Board, 
under Resolution No. 2017 series of 1999, already approved a PHP 1 
billion loan facility from LandBank/All Asia Capital. This was no more 
and no less than an actual credit facility from LandBank set in place by
 the members of the Old PEA Board for the funding of the PDMB Project, 
among others, pursuant to the previous PEA Board's own directive to PEA 
Management to seek such financing as of one year before.
[123]

 Thus, they argue that when the PEA Management subsequently recommended 
in its Memorandum dated October 21, 1999 containing the approval of the 
award of the construction contract to JD Legaspi as the lowest complying
 bidder under the simplified bidding process, there was no legal 
obstacle to the transaction, especially considering that PEA had already
 appropriated the contract amount against the LandBank loan of PHP 1 
billion for the purpose of seeing the project through. Hence, the 
members of the Old PEA Board believed in all good faith that the 
necessary measures and requirements were in place and complied with, and
 nothing criminal whatsoever attended their acts.
[124]

 With respect to Resolution No. 2057 dated December 15, 1999, the 
approval of the construction agreement between PEA and JD Legaspi, as 
the records would bear out, was based on the PEA Management Memorandum 
dated December 14, 1999 recommending Board Approval of the contract. 
Relying on good faith on this recommendation, the Old PEA Board approved
 the proposed corporate measure. Subsequently, it likewise approved the 
bridge financing of PHP 300 million under Board Resolution No. 2060, 
series of 2000 as part of the PHP 1 billion loan package from LandBank. 
As before, these were straightforward business decisions made by the Old
 PEA Board as a policy-making body based on the facts laid out before it
 by the PEA Management.
[125]
 

 As to Resolution No. 3017 dated July 5, 2000 approving Variation Order 
No. 1 (later renumbered to Variation Order No. 2), the decision of the 
Old PEA Board to pass the same was based on information provided by PEA 
Management. As stated in the PEA Management's Memorandum dated June 27, 
2000, the Seaside Drive Extension and proposed bridge connecting Central
 Business Park (
CBP
) II and CBP I B and C were necessary 
components to complete the road construction project. The approval, as 
contained in the Board Resolution, was also made expressly "subject to 
existing accounting auditing rules and regulations and to the following 
conditions, to wit: 
  


 a.	Payment will be made only on actual quantities completed 
based on the approved detailed plans and applicable unit bid prices and 
agreement prices (on new items of work) 


 b.	No time extensions will be associated on these additional works


 c.	Final approval of the Office of the President


 d.	Actual release of the loan proceeds from Land Bank."
[126]




 As to Resolution No. 3102 dated April 26, 2001 on the updated 
costs of the works covered by the original Variation No. 1 (renumbered 
as Variation Order No. 2) based on the detailed plans in the total 
amount of PHP 124,440,810.20, the same was also the subject of PEA 
Management Memorandum dated March 21, 2001, recommending approval of the
 updated costs. In approving the said Variation Order, the Old PEA 
Board, in addition to the previous conditions it imposed under Board 
Resolution No. 3017, further required that the implementation of 
Variation Order No. 2 be made subject to the provisions of P.D. No. 
1594, while the appropriation of the difference resulting from the 
updated cost thereof must be made subject to existing accounting and 
auditing rules and regulations.
[127]
  The members of the Old PEA Board further maintain that Section 86 of P.D. No. 1445
[128]

 merely requires that the certification as to availability of funds must
 state that "the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract for the
 current year is available for expenditure." It does not require the 
certification to state that funds are available for the entire project 
when the same will encompass more than one fiscal year. They cite 
Department of Justice Opinion No. 174, series of 1989, which states:
  


 However, in cases where the term of the contract extends beyond 
the year of its execution, such certification shall cover only the 
portion pertaining to the current year. Stated differently, the law lose
 (sic) not require in a multi-year contract that the certification of 
available funds should likewise cover the period exceeding the year the 
contract was executed.
[129]




 In the case at bar, the subject Construction Agreement, although 
fixed for a period of 360 days, straddles two fiscal years, the contract
 having been executed on April 10, 2000. The Certificate of Availability
 of Funds in the amount of PHP 300 million was thus compliant with the 
law and rules as the expected expenditures for the current fiscal year 
at the time the contract was executed was not expected to exceed said 
amount.
[130]
  Further, 
while the introduction of works for the Seaside Drive Extension was not 
included in the original contract, its addition was within the general 
scope of the PDMB Project as bid and awarded. Said provision merely 
requires that the scope of works in the proposed variation order must be
 related to the same general scope of works in the original project as 
bid and awarded. The scope of works in the construction of the Seaside 
Drive Extension is similar to the works undertaken in the original 
contract.
[131]
 
Furthermore, they argue that payments were made after the approval of 
National Economic and Development Authority, which was approved during 
the term of the New PEA Board, and not of the Old PEA Board. Yet, the 
Old PEA Board was held liable for the payment on costs which its members
 had no knowledge of, had not reviewed and approved, and had absolutely 
no control over.
[132]
  G.R. No. 220532

 In their Petition, BeriÃ±a, Jr., Millan, Viray, and Zori1la averred that
 the list of contractors submitted by the DPWH are contractors with 
Inter-Agency classification of large "B" and license classification of 
triple "AAA." As such, they are necessarily accredited by the PCAB 
because it is the body that accredits and classifies the licenses of 
contractors.
[133]
 By securing 
the list of contractors from the DPWH for purposes of simplified public 
bidding, PEA was assured that the contractors participating in the 
simplified public bidding would be qualified and competent to undertake 
the PDMB Project.
[134]
 
Moreover, the splitting of the ten contractors for Package 1 and Package
 2 of the PDMB Project is no proof that they were ill-motivated as they 
did so precisely to avoid a single contractor winning both packages.
[135]
 

 Further, they explained that all the requirements for the detailed 
engineering were done first hand, except for soils and foundation 
investigation which were based on existing data from comparative areas, 
particularly the SM segment, R1 Consortium segment, and actual test 
conducted along Uniwide Coastal Mall.
[136]

 They also claimed that the bid document furnished to all prospective 
bidders contained preliminary designs and studies based on comparative 
data available for bidding purposes, hence, the need for the winning 
bidder to validate said data.
[137]

 They add that PEA is a government-owned and controlled corporation that
 generates its own funds from its operations, and is not dependent upon 
Congress for funds. In the case of the PDMB Project, its funding was 
made available through loans obtained by PEA for that purpose, which 
incidentally have already been fully paid years ago. Thus, there was no 
risk that PDMB Project would not be completed as a consequence of the 
phasing of the project because PEA had its own assets, revenues, and 
other sources of funding to pay, as it did, for the construction of the 
project.
[138]
 Further, 
P.D. No. 1594 does not limit the subject of a variation order only to 
items that are included in the original contract as awarded. It allows a
 contractor to be awarded a variation order in the form of an extra work
 order for introducing work items that are not included in the original 
contract, so long as the works are merely for the completion of the 
project and the aggregate amount thereof does not exceed 25% of the 
escalated original price.
[139]

 P.D. No. 1594 also allows a negotiated contract where a variation order
 is adjacent or contiguous to an ongoing project and could be 
economically prosecuted by the same contractor. From the ground and 
aerial sketches, the Integrated Framework Plan and the present Google 
image of the President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard, the Seaside Drive 
Extension as well as the Inland Channel Bridge are adjacent and/or 
contiguous to JD Legaspi's PDMB Project.
[140]

 They also argue that the acts found by the Sandiganbayan were merely 
recommendatory in nature and subject to the approval of the PEA General 
Manager and the Board of Directors. Thus, all the functions of the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee, of which BeriÃ±a, Jr. and Viray were members; of the Planning
 Task Force, of which Viray was Chairman with Zorilla and two other 
engineers as members; and of the Construction Task Force of which Millan
 was Project Director, Viray as Project Manager, Zorilla as Resident 
Engineer and two other engineers as members â all involved in submitting
 proposals and recommendations for the approval of the PEA General 
Manager and Board of Directors.
[141]
 G.R. No. 220587

 In his Petition, Legaspi argues that the Sandiganbayan arrived at a 
conclusion of his overt act in the implied conspiracy for violation of 
Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 for suggesting, proposing, pushing for, 
and submitting documents pertaining to the construction of the Seaside 
Drive Extension as a Change Order based on the Sworn Affidavit dated 
September 23, 2002 attached to Tuazon's counter-affidavit, which the 
Sandiganbayan took judicial notice of.
[142]

 Legaspi however claims that the Sandiganbayan contravened law and 
jurisprudence in concluding that the aforesaid Sworn Affidavit was 
admissible and may be taken judicial notice of considering that (i) it 
was not formally offered by the prosecution or the defense; (ii) there 
was no prior motion and hearing for its admission or judicial notice; 
(iii) the affiant was never presented in court; and (iv) the Sworn 
Affidavit is immaterial to the charges against him as it actually 
pertained to the Bay Boulevard, a project unrelated, and different from,
 the Seaside Drive Extension.
[143]

 Paragraph 4 of the Sworn Affidavit expressly states that it refers to 
the "Bay Boulevard Project" and not to the Seaside Drive Extension 
project, to wit:
[144]




 4. On 3 May 2001, JDLC submitted to PEA a proposal to do the Bay
 Boulevard Project which is adjacent/contiguous to the Central Boulevard
 Project and which is intended to connect Central Boulevard with Roxas 
Boulevard. The PEA Management recommended to the PEA Board the approval 
of this proposal sometime at the end of May 2001.
[145]




  The	differences between these projects were further outlined by Legaspi as follows:
[146]












Disparities

Date of Proposal 










PEA Management Memorandum to the 
Board, recommended approval of Seaside Drive Extension on June 27, 2000;
 PEA Board approved the Seaside Drive Extension on July 5, 2000, via 
Board Resolution No. 3017 




 






According to paragraph 4 of the Sworn Affidavit: 
                  
              


Alleged proposal was submitted on May 3, 2001, about a year after the Seaside Drive Extension was already approved.
[147]
 




 








Legaspi likewise argues that the proposal, which he allegedly made,
 was neither charged in the Information nor put in issue during trial. 
Otherwise, Legaspi or the other accused would have been given the 
opportunity to present evidence to the contrary. He cited that BeriÃ±a, 
Jr. admitted in his Memorandum dated June 27, 2000 that he was the one 
who requested for the approval of the Seaside Drive Extension, as it 
would "facilitate the flow of traffic at the Seaside Drive Extension," 
and that "it is deemed necessary to complete the construction of the 
proposed Seaside Drive Extension (connecting Roxas [Boulevard] and 
Central [Boulevard])..." This was never rebutted by the prosecution.
[148]

 Furthermore, Millan himself admitted that while JD Legaspi's firm was 
in the process of designing the PDMB Project, there was also an 
instruction from the PEA Management to include the Seaside Drive 
Extension and the bridge.
[149]


  Legaspi added that it was then President Estrada himself who 
directed that the "road project including appurtenances be completed on 
or before April 2001."
[150]
 
This was stated in the letter dated May 3, 2000 of Carlos P. Doble, as 
former PEA General Manager, to Legaspi. Pursuant to then President 
Estrada's directive, PEA requested the submission of quotations for, 
inter alia
,
 the construction of the Seaside Drive Extension and the Bay, Boulevard.
 Clearly, it was PEA Management, through Doble, which initiated and 
pushed for the construction of the Seaside Drive Extension.
[151]

 Legaspi further claimed that in the subject criminal information, he 
and the other accused were charged with "approving/allowing several 
improper variation/change orders and overruns to be implemented without 
the requisite presidential approval and the appropriate funds" and 
"allowing and paying or causing the allowance and payment of several 
claims of Legaspi for variation orders, overruns, and other claims even 
when the same were clearly improper, illegal and without the requisite 
presidential approval, thereby paving the way for Legaspi to claim and 
receive undue payments from the Government totaling millions of pesos in
 overprice."
[152]
 However, he 
was convicted for pushing, suggesting, and proposing the award and 
implementation of the Seaside Drive Extension, which was void for not 
being part of the original project as bid and awarded to him, and not 
for implementing the Seaside Drive Extension despite the lack of a 
Notice to Proceed and Office of the President's approval, and for 
submitting the Variation Order for the Seaside Drive Extension to the 
Board a mere 78 days after the Construction Agreement was signed.
[153]
 He then cited the case of 
Burgos v. Sandiganbayan
,
 where there was a stark variance between the allegation in the 
information and proof adduced during trial with respect to the means of 
committing violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, as in this case, 
that Legaspi spearheaded the implementation of the Seaside Drive 
Extension, and that said road cannot be awarded through a variation 
order. However, Legaspi was charged in the Information with implementing
 the variation orders and overruns despite lack of approval from the 
Office of the President.
[154]

  Legaspi adds that it was pursuant to Memorandum Circular No. 25 issued
 on February 10, 1999, which served as a basis for the requirement of 
presidential approval, and prompted then Executive Secretary Zamora to 
require all extra works and price adjustments to be submitted to the 
president. It requires that the project must have been awarded and 
approved by the head of the agency. Thus, the approval of the president 
will only be sought after the Head of the Procuring Entity, which is the
 PEA Board, has signed its approval for the project. BeriÃ±a, Jr. and 
Millan were thus not required by law or by the terms of the contract to 
await prior presidential approval before recommending the award of the 
Seaside Drive Extension to Legaspi.
[155]

 He adds that no presidential approval was required for the 
implementation of the works under Variation Order No. 2 because 
Executive Order No. 109, issued on May 27, 2002, removed the requirement
 of presidential approval when it expressly repealed Memorandum Circular
 No. 25. Due to the express repeal of Memorandum Circular No. 25, the 
approval of the Variation Orders shall be governed by the provisions of 
P.D. No. 1594. Section 1, CI-3, Chapter III thereof provides that "Under
 no circumstances shall a contractor proceed to commence work under any 
Change Order, Extra Work Order or Supplemental Agreement unless it has 
been approved by the Secretary or his duly authorized representative." 
Thus, he argues that upon the effectivity of Executive Order No. 109 on 
May 27, 2002, the approval of the President was no longer necessary for 
the implementation of Variation Order No. 2.
[156]
 Consolidated Comment
 In its Consolidated Comment
[157]

 dated June 15, 2017, the Office of the Special Prosecutor argued that 
the petitions filed by Lacson and the members of the Old PEA Board 
failed to indicate the material dates of their receipt of the notice of 
the assailed February 5, 2015 Decision in violation of Sections 4(b) and
 5 of Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court.
[158]
 They also argue that the petitioners' call for the re-examination of the factual findings of the court
 a quo
 are thus improper in an appeal by 
certiorari 
under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.
[159]

 They add that the pre-requisite presidential approval was expressly 
mentioned in the Memorandum dated January 29, 2000 issued by then 
Executive Secretary Zamora and was expressly carried over to the 
Construction Agreement signed on April 10, 2000 which contained 
provisions embodying the conditions that "adjustment of contract price 
due to escalation shall be effected in accordance with P.D. No. 1594 and
 its IRR, upon written agreement of the parties and subject to 
availability of funds" and "changes in the schedule and work required 
shall be made...upon the written consent of the parties... and approval 
of the President." In this case, the variations and changes have all 
reached the implementation stage albeit the absence of such presidential
 approval.
[160]


 While Executive Order No. 109 expressly repealed Memorandum 
Circular No. 25, the required presidential approval, did not do away 
with the necessary clearance from the president for the following 
reasons: (a) Executive Order No. 109 speaks of government contracts, not
 contract price adjustments; (6) Variation Order No. 2 was processed for
 approval even before Executive Order No. 109 came into effect. The PDMB
 was inaugurated on April 5, 2002 whereas Executive Order No. 109 was 
issued only on May 27, 2002; (c) The Office of the President's 
Memorandum dated January 29, 2000, which approved the Construction 
Agreement, subject to certain conditions, expressly states that all 
extra works and price adjustments should first be submitted to the 
president for approval; and (d) Article 8 of the Construction Agreement,
 which is the law between the parties, expressly requires presidential	
approval	for any change order and/or additional work.
[161]

 They also argue that simplified public bidding dispenses only with the 
requirements of publication/advertisement and posting. It does not 
include an authority for the Bids and Awards Committee or any 
Ad Hoc

 Committee for that matter to secure the list of qualified 
contractor-bidders from other organizations, or any other government 
agency. Thus, when PEA's 
Ad Hoc
 Committee, of which petitioners 
are members, obtained the list from DPWH Special Buildings Project 
Management Office, whose area of responsibility was vertical 
construction buildings, it blatantly violated the law.
[162]
 Further, the members of the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee doubly violated the rules of procurement when they 
arbitrarily divided the list of accredited contractor-bidders into two 
groups, one group to bid in Package 1, and another to bid in Package 2. 
This situation resulted in the award of the project to JD Legaspi, to 
the disadvantage of contractors in the second set of the DPWH list and 
those contractors who are PCAB-accredited but were not included in the 
DPWH list.
[163]


	 There was also no actual soil boring test conducted on the 
site to be developed. As a result, the estimates in the detailed 
engineering was not based on the actual conditions of the site to be 
developed but was drawn from an assumption of available data from the 
adjacent areas.
[164]
 
The Bid Plans and even the approved agency estimate, by themselves, do 
not prove that a detailed engineering and survey had been conducted. The
 prosecution	has	shown	that	no	other	documentation	of	the	alleged '	I 
engineering plan exists so much so that the said bid plans and agency 
estimates become questionable for having no basis at all.
[165]
 Further, there were no sufficient funds when the project was bid out and awarded to JD Legaspi.
[166]

 The best evidence of the sufficiency of funds for the project would 
have been a document or testimony from the Landbank/All Asia Capital, 
confirming the approval of the PHP 1 billion loan facility. However, the
 best that they could muster was a Certification dated May 3, 2000 
issued by LandBank's Assistant Vice President, confirming that the PEA 
had a PHP 300 million short term loan line facility.
[167]

 The Office of the Special Prosecutor maintains that the construction of
 the Seaside Drive Extension was illegal. Geographically, the Seaside 
Drive Extension is located outside the roadway plan for the PDMB 
project. On the other hand, the Inland Channel Bridge is located along 
the stretch of the project and necessary to connect two segments of the 
road separated by a creek. These additional works are both the subject 
of Variation Order No. 2
[168]
 which was approved despite the illegality of the construction of the Seaside Drive Extension.
 Petitioners thereafter filed their corresponding Reply,
[169]
 reiterating their positions.
 This Court's Ruling


 We shall first address the procedural issues raised by the Office of the Special Prosecutor.

 Contrary to its claim that the members of the Old PEA Board failed to 
indicate the date of receipt of the assailed Decision, a reading of the 
Joint Petition would show that they made an allegation that the 
Sandiganbayan read the dispositive portion of the assailed Decision in 
open court.
[170]
 Necessarily, 
the date when the Sandiganbayan read the dispositive portion of its 
Decision that was promulgated on February 5, 2015, is also the date when
 they received the aforesaid decision. They thereafter filed a motion 
for reconsideration within the 15-day period, and stated in their Joint 
Petition the date when they respectively received the Joint Resolution 
denying their motion for reconsideration. As alleged:
  


 11.1 On 28 September 2015, Petitioners Padilla and Dayan were 
separately served copies of the Joint Resolution through their 
respective counsels. 


 11.2 On 30 September 2015, Petitioners Chan, Damaso and San Juan were separately served copies of the 
Joint Resolution
 through their respective counsels.
[171]
 (Emphasis in the original)




 Lacson, also made the following narration:
  


  From the date of receipt by petitioner of the Joint Resolution 
on September 28, 2015 denying his motion for reconsideration, he filed a
 Motion for Extension of Time to file a Petition for Review on [
Certiorari
] seeking for a Thirty (30) days on October 9, 2015, or up to and until November 12, 2015.
[172]
 (Emphasis supplied)




 It must be remembered that the purpose of requiring the date of 
receipt of the assailed decision and resolution in a petition is to 
determine its timeliness. In this case, the dates described by 
petitioners were sufficient for this Court to determine that the 
petition was indeed filed on time. 
 The Office of the Special 
Prosecutor also assails the allegations of petitioners claiming that 
they failed to comply with the requirement under Rule 45 of the Rules of
 Court for which only questions of law may be raised. 
 A question
 of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain 
state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises 
as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.
[173]

 In this case, the actions taken by petitioners and how the PDMB Project
 was awarded to JD Legaspi was no longer disputed. Rather, it is the 
applicability of the provisions of the law that were cited by the 
Sandiganbayan, ultimately concluding a violation of Section 3(e) of R.A.
 No. 3019, upon which the issues raised by petitioners revolved.
 
Further, as a rule, findings of fact of the Sandiganbayan, as a trial 
court, are accorded great weight and respect. However, in cases where 
there is a misappreciation of facts, this Court will not hesitate to 
reverse the conclusions reached by the trial court. At all times, this 
Court must be satisfied that in convicting the accused, the factual 
findings and conclusions of the trial court meet the exacting standard 
of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Otherwise, the presumption of 
innocence must be favored, and exoneration must be granted as a matter 
of right.
[174]
 As such, the 
instant case must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that indeed, the 
exacting standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt has been met.
Now on the merits.
The Sandiganbayan summarized its basis for convicting petitioners for violation of R.A. No. 3019 as follows:

 	Violating the simplified bidding rules because they shortlisted bidders not based on the PCAB master list; 
Conducting the bidding and recommending the award to accused 
Legaspi without detailed engineering in violation of P.D. 1594 and 
without the required appropriation and actual availability of funds for 
the total contract price; 
Creating and confirming the artificial phases in the Construction 
Agreement and dividing the contract into Phase I and Phase II just to 
enable PEA to circumvent the requirement under P.D. No. 1445 about 
funding requirements. In the case of Mortel. . . 
In the case of accused BeriÃ±a[, Jr.] and Millan, recommending the 
approval of Variation Order No. 2 and the contract price adjustment, and
 the payment thereof without the required presidential approval and in 
violation of P.D. No. 1594; 
 In the case of San Juan, Chan, Dayan, Malbarosa, Padilla and 
Damaso, for approving and confirming the Legaspi contract without 
sufficient funding and the Seaside Drive Extension without public 
bidding; 
In the case of Legaspi, for conspiring with BeriÃ±a[, Jr.] and 
Millan in having the Seaside Drive Extension contract awarded to him 
under a negotiated contract.
[175]


 At the outset, it must be clarified that a violation of the law and 
rules of procurement does not automatically equate to a violation of 
R.A. No. 3019. As explained in 
Sabaldan v. Office of the Ombudsman
:
[176]




 [E]ven granting that there may be violations of the applicable 
procurement laws, the same does not mean that the elements of violation 
of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 are already present as a matter of 
course. For there to be a violation under Section 3(c) of R.A. No. 3019 
based on a breach of applicable procurement laws, one cannot solely rely
 on the mere fact that a violation of procurement laws has been 
committed. It must be shown that (1) the violation of procurement laws 
caused undue injury to any party or gave any private patty unwarranted 
benefits, advantage or preference; and (2) the accused acted with 
evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence.
[177]




 Thus, despite findings for violation of the procurement law, it is 
the elements comprising R.A. No. 3019 that must be materially proven, 
especially that an information charges a criminal offense, as defined by
 R.A. No. 3019, and not by P.D. No. 1594 or R.A. No. 9184.
[178]
 These elements were further elaborated in 
Chung v. Ombudsman
[179]
 as follows:



 By the very language of Section 3, paragraph (e) of RA 3019, which
 defines "corrupt practices of public officers," the elements of 
manifest partiality, evident bad faith, and gross inexcusable negligence
 and of giving unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to another 
must go hand in hand with a showing of fraudulent intent and corrupt 
motives.


 Evident bad faith "does not simply connote bad judgment or 
negligence" but of having a "palpably and patently fraudulent and 
dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some
 perverse motive or ill will. It contemplates a state of mind 
affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive or 
self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes."


 Manifest partiality, on the other hand, is defined as a clear, 
notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or 
person rather than another, while gross inexcusable negligence is 
defined as negligence characterized by the want of even the slightest 
care. It presupposes acting or omitting to act in a situation where 
there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and 
intentionally, with conscious indifference to consequences insofar as 
other persons may be affected.
[180]
 (Citations omitted)




 Guided by the foregoing, the acts found by the Sandiganbayan that led to the conviction of petitioners must be re-examined.
 DPWH list versus PCAB Masterlist

 In holding that petitioners violated the rules on simplified public 
bidding, the Sandiganbayan relied on the IRR of P.D. No. 1594 as 
amended,
[181]
 stating that 
there is an obligation on the part of the PEA to consult the separate 
list of the PCAB before the negotiated bidding of the PDMB Project could
 proceed. The provision reads:



 a. Participation in simplified public bidding for a project shall be limited to 
bona fide

 contractors duly accredited and classified for the project category and
 size and who are included in a separate master list to be prepared by 
the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (
PCAB
) pursuant to
 the uniform  guidelines promulgated by the PCAB. The guidelines shall 
put emphasis on strict requirements of good track record performance 
and/or capability requirements, among others.




 On his part, Lacson, a member of the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee, 
explained that Atty. Enriquez had reported that the "separate 
masterlist" that was supposed to be prepared by the PCAB was not yet 
available then. Instead, he was furnished by the PCAB with a copy of a 
general masterlist in the NCR containing hundreds	of listed contractors	
with their respective		PCAB category/license.
[182]

 The problem then became how to narrow down the list of pre-qualified 
bidders to achieve the objective of conducting a "simplified bidding" as
 approved by the Office of the President. To use the general masterlist 
obtained by Atty. Enriquez could be unwieldy and militate against the	
presidential	instructions	to immediately	have	the	PDMB	Project available
 to the public.	Hence, the Chairman of the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee 
decided to seek the help of the DPWH for a list of PCAB contractors with
 large "B," triple "AAA" category/license for roads and bridges since 
this is the nature of the PDMB Project.
[183]
 On this issue, we rule in favor of petitioners.

 Notably, the prosecution did not present evidence showing that a 
separate masterlist, from which contractors of projects for simplified 
public bidding must be chosen from, is available. To continuously 
require PEA to rely on a separate masterlist that is not yet in 
existence would be to punish petitioners for an inherently impossible 
task, which cannot even be attributed as their fault. It was not the 
obligation of PEA to produce the masterlist; rather, the responsibility 
fell upon the PCAB to do so. Before PEA may be accused of its failure to
 comply with an obligation imposed by law, it must first be shown that 
such an obligation is capable of being performed. This is especially 
true in this case where the obligation of PEA is conditioned upon the 
fulfillment of the obligation of PCAB. As such, it is not simply the 
obligation imposed by law that must be examined; the corresponding 
obligation upon which its performance is made dependent, should also be 
taken into consideration. It is thus necessary to first establish that a
 separate masterlist of 
bona fide
 contractors duly accredited and
 classified for the project category, indeed exists. This is in line 
with the rule on burden of proof, which imposes upon the prosecution the
 burden of proving its allegations. A negative fact such as the absence 
of the masterlist, cannot serve as a basis for a wrongdoing, when the 
prosecution itself has not first presented proof of its existence. This 
flows from the maxim "
semper necessitas probandi incumbit illi qui agit
," or the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays the charges.

 In the absence of a separate masterlist, PEA was left with an 
alternative to consult the list of DPWH with large "B" and triple "AAA" 
category/license for roads and bridges. For sure, these are the largest 
in the categorization of the DPWH and among the top tier in the 
classification of contractors. These are the lists of contractors with 
experience to build roads and bridges. 
 As of November 22, 2017, 
in the Board Resolution No. 201 Series of 2017 issued by PCAB, Category 
AAA was defined as those contractors with minimum financial capacity of 
PHP 180 million, while Category AAAA are those with minimum financial 
capacity of PHP 1 billion. Those with a size range of Large B with 
License Category AAA and AAAA are those with single largest project of 
above PHP 225 million and allowable range of contract costs of less than
 or above PHP 450 million. Notably, the amount allotted for the PDMB 
Project, which is PHP 584,365,885.00, falls within the range of Category
 AAA and Large B contractor. The actions taken by the PEA must thus be 
treated as substantial compliance with the requirement of the law 
considering the absence of the separate masterlist and taking into 
consideration Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 1594, which reads: 



 (b) Technical Requirements. The prospective contractor must meet 
the following technical requirements to be established in accordance 
with the	rules and regulations to be promulgated pursuant to Section 12 
of this Decree, to enable him to satisfactorily prosecute the subject 
project: 


 1)	Competence and experience of the contractor in managing projects similar to the subject project. 


 2)	Competence and experience of the contractor's key personnel to be assigned to the subject project. 


 3)	Availability and commitment of the contractor's equipment to be used for the subject project. 




 Nowhere from the evidence presented by the prosecution was it shown 
that JD Legaspi or any of the bidders was unqualified or had no 
competence to undertake the PDMB Project because the PEA relied on the 
DPWH list. On the contrary, the winning bidder, JD Legaspi, was able to 
perform his part of the contract. As PEA was merely performing its 
mandate, it cannot take the blame for the shortcoming committed by 
another agency. The circumstances that led to PEA's action in utilizing 
the DPWH therefore negates the presence of manifest partiality, evident 
bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence under Section 3(e) of R.A. No.
 3019.
  In the same manner, as there was no list prepared by 
PCAB, there were also no guidelines as to how the project could be bid 
out. While the Sandiganbayan found that when PEA divided the PDMB 
Project into Phase I and Phase II, and respectively divided the ten 
contractors under these two phases, those under Phase II were 
disadvantaged because of the option given to the SM group and R1 
Consortium to build on the land they were awarded, which was covered by 
the Phase II, there was no sufficient proof to show that the PEA made 
this to accommodate any of the contractors listed for Phase I. It was 
not even shown by the prosecution that the bid of the contractors under 
Phase II could match the lowest complying bid of JD Legaspi under Phase 
I. A bidding was still conducted by the PEA for the Phase I Project, 
which included different participants. Thus, it could not be said that 
JD Legaspi was given an unwarranted preference in the award of the 
project.
 Detailed engineering
 The Sandiganbayan also found
 that the absence of a detailed engineering affected the cost estimate 
of the project. With this, the cost adjustments that had to be done in 
order to pursue the project became bloated.
 A reading of the 
pleadings made available before this Court would show that petitioners 
did not deny the absence of a detailed engineering for the PDMB Project.
 Rather, what was taken into consideration was the condition of the 
adjacent land, which was awarded to the other contractors as part of the
 PDMB Project.
 This contravenes Section 2 of P.D. No. 1594, which reads:



 
Section 2.
 
Detailed Engineering
. No bidding and/or 
award of contract for a construction project shall be made unless the 
detailed engineering investigations, surveys, and designs for the 
project have been sufficiently carried out in accordance with the 
standards and specifications to be established under the rules and 
regulations to be promulgated pursuant to Section 12 of this Decree so 
as to minimize quantity and cost overruns and underruns, change orders 
and extra work orders, and unless the detailed engineering documents 
have been approved by the Minister of Public Works, Transportation and 
Communications, the Minister of Public Highways, or the Minister of 
Energy, as the case may be. (Emphasis in the original)




 Section 2 of P.D. No. 1594 requires that a detailed engineering be 
carried out before any bidding or contract is awarded for a construction
 project. Obviously, this requirement is addressed to the agency 
concerned, not to a bidder. It is from this detailed engineering that 
the concerned agency can get an estimate of the project, which it will 
then use as basis in the evaluation of the bids.
[184]

 As mentioned, the PEA, in coming up with its Agency Budget Estimate, 
merely relied on the conditions of the adjacent land, which should not 
be the case. The responsibility on the preparation of the bid documents 
falls upon the members of the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee, who was tasked to evaluate the condition of the road before the same could be bid out.

 Nevertheless, violation of this provision alone, without clear showing 
of bad faith, malice, or gross negligence should not be automatically 
equated to a violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. There must be 
proof amounting to a corrupt motive in doing so, for as explained in 
Martel v. People
:
[185]




 At this juncture, the Court emphasizes the spirit that animates 
R.A. 3019. As its title implies, and as what can be gleaned from the 
deliberations of Congress, R.A. 3019 was crafted as an anti-graft and 
corruption measure. At the heart of the acts punishable under R.A. 3019 
is 
corruption
. As explained by one of the sponsors of the law, 
Senator Arturo M. Tolentino, "while we are trying to penalize, the main 
idea of the bill is graft and corrupt practices. x x x Well, the idea of
 graft is the one emphasized." Graft entails the acquisition of gain in 
dishonest
 ways.
[186]
 (Emphasis in the original; citations omitted)




 At the most, the absence of a detailed engineering could affect the 
budget or cost for which government must spend for the completion of the
 project. Overpricing should however be proven to have been committed 
with deliberate corrupt ways before one can be indicted for violation of
 R.A. No. 3019. As held in 
Macairan v. People
:
[187]




 Jurisprudence teaches that in assessing whether there was 
overpricing, a specific comparison with the same brand, features and 
specifications as those purchased in the questioned transaction should 
be made. Further, the report upon which the proof of overpricing is 
based should include a canvass of the different suppliers of the 
identical product with their corresponding prices. Absent this evidence,
 the Court cannot reasonably conclude that the price of the goods 
subject of the questioned transaction was actually exorbitant.
[188]
 (Citations omitted)




 In this case, the Special Audit Report of the COA found that there 
was no overpricing in the portion of the contract awarded to Legaspi. 
Its findings stated the following:
 Source of Fund



 The contract with J.D. Legaspi Construction amounting to 
P584,365,885.00 was further increased to P837,317,343.77 due to contract
 price adjustments, variation orders, overrun/underrun and supplemental 
agreement. The funding source was the P300 Million loan with Land Bank 
of the Philippines, which was released on April 7, 2000, and the P1 
Billion loan from the Government Service Insurance System of which the 
initial drawdown amounting to P600 Million was released on August 15, 
2002.


 . . . .




 Summary of Audit Findings 



Finding No. 1
  


 The technical evaluation of the project shows that the total 
project cost, including the price adjustment was found to be reasonable 
and, therefore, not overpriced. The project was constructed in 
accordance with the approved design, scope of work and as-built plans 
and specifications.


 The allegation of overpricing raised in the complaint of Mr. 
Sulpicio Tagud, Director, Public Estates Authority (PEA), based on the 
cost comparison per linear meter of road and bridge constructed by three
 (3) developers/contractors, appears to be untenable. The road networks 
undertaken by the three (3) developers/contractors are not comparable 
considering that Central Business Park (CBP) I-A, CBP I-B & C 
(reclaimed by SM/R-1 Consortium) were reclaimed by 
pre-loading/surcharging method to attain the required soil consolidation
 and stability. On the other hand, Financial Center Area (FCA), CBP-2 
and Asiaworld area are existing reclaimed areas prior to the 1988 Manila
 Cavite Coastal Road and Reclamation Project (MCCRRP) Master Development
 which have poor subgrade materials as confirmed by the Bureau of 
Research and Standards (BRS) and the R.R. Ignacio Construction as shown 
in the results of the Borehole tests conducted in November of 1999. 
Logically, the actual cost per linear meter incurred by the SM Group and
 R1 Construction as against the cost incurred by J.D. Legaspi 
Construction cannot be compared because the areas assigned for each of 
these contractors are with different soil conditions requiring different
 design for each project.


 The technical evaluation conducted has clearly established the 
reasonableness of the project cost. The audit team, therefore, finds no 
sufficient basis to support the allegation of overpricing.
[189]




 Considering that the COA, the constitutionally bound auditor of 
government funds, declared that no overpricing occurred, such findings 
should be given considerable weight. This further shows that no injury 
was proven to have been caused to the government; neither any manifest 
partiality in favor of a party was given. As part of the elements of 
violation of R.A. No. 3019, failure to prove these would be tantamount 
to a failure to prove violation of the law, beyond reasonable doubt.
 The requirement of availability of funds
 With respect to the availability of funds, Section 86 of P.D. No. 1445 provides: 



 SECTION 86. 
Certificate Showing Appropriation to Meet Contract
.
 â Except in the case of a contract. for personal service, for supplies 
for current consumption or to be carried in stock not exceeding the 
estimated consumption for three months, or banking transactions of 
government-owned or controlled banks no contract involving the 
expenditure of public funds by any government agency shall be entered 
into or authorized unless the proper accounting official of the agency 
concerned shall have certified to the officer entering into the 
obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for the purpose and 
that the amount necessary 
to cover the proposed	contract for	the current	fiscal year is	available for expenditure on account thereof
,
 subject to verification by the auditor concerned. The certificate 
signed by the proper accounting official and the auditor who verified 
it, shall be attached to and become an integral part of the proposed 
contract, and the sum so certified shall not thereafter be available for
 expenditure for any other purpose until the obligation of the 
government agency concerned under the contract is fully extinguished. 
(Emphasis supplied)




  The foregoing provision requires that the appropriation necessary 
in order to consider a contract as sufficiently funded must cover that 
portion of the needed expenditures for the particular current year. 
Necessarily, when a contract transcends beyond a period of one year, and
 must be completed within a multi-year period, the availability of 
appropriations must be examined for each of the current fiscal year that
 arrives. This does not however mean that the implementing agency should
 look for funds only when the current fiscal year arrives. Rather, the 
source from which the funding for the entire project must already be 
determined, for while the actual release of funds may be made on a 
yearly basis, continuous payment to a contractor on a multi-year project
 could only be made if the source of funds has already been determined. 
This is supported by R.A. No. 9184 which requires that the invitation to
 bid identify the source of fund of the project, thus:



 
SEC. 21. Advertising and Contents of the Invitation to Bid.

 â In line with the principle of transparency and competitiveness, all 
Invitations to Bid for contracts under competitive bidding shall be 
advertised by the Procuring Entity in such manner and for such length of
 time as may be necessary under the circumstances, in order to ensure 
the widest possible dissemination thereof, such as, but not limited to, 
posting in the Procuring Entity's premises, in newspapers of general 
circulation, the G-EPS and the website of the Procuring Entity, if 
available. The details and mechanics of implementation shall be provided
 in the IRR to be promulgated under this Act. 


 The Invitation to Bid shall contain, among others: 




 (a)	A brief description of the subject matter of the Procurement; 

      (b)	A general statement on the criteria to be used by the 
Procuring Entity for the eligibility check, the short listing of 
prospective bidders, in the case of the Procurement of Consulting 
Services, the examination and evaluation of Bids, and 
post-qualification;
 
      (c)	The date, time and place of the deadline for the submission 
and receipt of the eligibility requirements, the pre-bid conference if 
any, the submission and receipt of bids, and the opening of bids;
 
      (d)	The Approved Budget for the Contract to be bid;
 
      (e)	
The source of funds
;
 
      (f) The period of availability of the Bidding Documents, and the place where these may be secured; 

      (g)	The contract duration; and, 

      (h)	Such other necessary information deemed relevant by the Procuring Entity. (Emphasis supplied) 






 In the case of projects funded by the national budget, it is even 
required for the agency to secure a multi-year obligational authority to
 secure its commitment of paying the multi-year project and ultimately 
complete the project. This was explained in 
Jacomille v. Abaya
[190]
 as follows: 



 MYOA or Multi-Year Obligational Authority is an authorization 
document issued by the DBM to government agencies that undertake MYP 
with funding requirements spread over two (2) years or more. Such 
projects are evidenced by MYC entered into by the parties. In GAA 2013, 
the requirement of MYOA is stated as follows: 




 
Sec. 21. Contracting Multi-Year Projects
. In the 
implementation of multi-year projects where the total cost is not 
provided in this Act, department, bureaus and offices shall request the 
DBM for the issuance of a Multi-Year Obligational Authority following 
the guidelines under DBM Circular Letter No. 2004-12 dated October 27, 
2004. Notwithstanding the issuance of a Multi-Year Obligation Authority,
 the obligation to be incurred in any given year, shall in no case 
exceed the allotment released for the purpose during the year. 




 As early as October 27, 2004, the DBM issued the DBM Circular No. 
2004-12 to prescribe the guidelines and procedure to implement the MYOA 
requirement. The circular defines the different terms affecting MYOA, 
such as: 




 
3.1 Multi-Year Obligational Authority (MYOA)
 - refers to 
an authority issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to 
enable an agency to enter into a multi-year contract whether for locally
 funded projects (LFPs) or foreign assisted projects (FAPs). 




. . . .


 The DBM explained the nature of MYOA. When the government entered 
into MYC, it was committed to annually pay a given amount to the 
contractor/supplier of the project, even without the government planning
 for its payment. Thus, the imperative for MYOA arose, which gave an 
assurance that the financial commitments included in MYC are considered 
in the succeeding proposed budget submitted to Congress. With the 
issuance of MYOA, the DBM commits to recommend to Congress the funding 
of the MYP until its completion. Evidently, without MYOA, the government
 runs the risk of breach of contractual obligations if its financial 
commitments are not met for lack of funding.
[191]
 (Emphasis in the original)




 The absence of a multi-year obligational authority would ultimately result in a void contract, as applied in 
COMELEC v. Quijano-Padilla
,
[192]
 as follows:



 Extant on the record is the fact that the VRIS Project was awarded
 to PHOTOKINA on account of its bid in the amount of P6.588 Billion 
Pesos. However, under Republic Act No. 8760, the only fund appropriated 
for the project was P1 Billion Pesos and under the Certification of 
Available Funds (CAF) only P1.2 Billion Pesos was available. Clearly, 
the amount appropriated is insufficient to cover the cost of the entire 
VRIS Project. There is no way that the COMELEC could enter into a 
contract with PHOTOKINA whose accepted bid was way beyond the amount 
appropriated by law for the project. This being the case, the BAC should
 have rejected the bid for being excessive or should have withdrawn the 
Notice of Award on the ground that in the eyes of the law, the same is 
null and void.


 The objections of then Chairman Demetriou to the implementation of
 the VRIS Project, ardently carried on by her successor Chairman 
Benipayo, are therefore in order.


 Even the draft contract submitted by Commissioner Sadain, that 
provides for a contract price in the amount of P1.2 Billion Pesos is 
unacceptable. Indeed, we share the observation of former Chairman 
Demetriou that it circumvents the statutory requirements on government 
contracts. While the contract price under the draft contract is only 
P1.2 Billion and, thus, within the certified available funds, the same 
covers only Phase 1 of the VRIS Project, i.e., the issuance of 
identification cards for only 1,000,000 voters in specified areas. In 
effect, the implementation of the VRIS Project will be "segmented" or 
"chopped" into several phases. Not only is such arrangement disallowed 
by our budgetary laws and practices, it is also disadvantageous to the 
COMELEC because of the uncertainty that will loom over its modernization
 project for an indefinite period of time. Should Congress fail to 
appropriate the amount necessary for the completion of the entire 
project, what good will the accomplished Phase I serve? As expected, the
 project failed "to sell" with the Department of Budget and Management. 
Thus, Secretary Benjamin Diokno, per his letter of December 1, 2000, 
declined the COMELEC's request for the issuance of the Notice of Cash 
Availability (NCA) and a multi-year obligational authority to assume 
payment of the total VRIS Project for lack of legal basis. Corollarily, 
under Section 33 of R.A. No. 8760, no agency shall enter into a 
multi-year contract without a multi-year obligational authority, thus:




 "SECTION 33.
 Contracting Multi-Year Projects.
 - In the 
implementation of multi-year projects, no agency shall enter into a 
multi-year contract without a multi-year Obligational Authority issued 
by the Department of Budget and Management for the purpose. 
Notwithstanding the issuance of the multi-year Obligational Authority, 
the obligation to be incurred in any given calendar year, shall in no 
case exceed the amount programmed for implementation during said 
calendar year." 




 Petitioners are justified in refusing to formalize the contract 
with PHOTOKINA. Prudence dictated them not to enter into a contract not 
backed up by sufficient appropriation and available funds. Definitely, 
to act otherwise would be a futile exercise for the contract would 
inevitably suffer the vice of nullity. In [
OsmeÃ±a vs. Commission on Audit
,] this Court held:




 "The Auditing Code of the Philippines (P.D. 1445) further 
provides that no contract involving the expenditure of public funds 
shall be entered into unless there is an appropriation therefor and the 
proper accounting official of the agency concerned shall have certified 
to the officer entering into the obligation that
 funds have been 
duly appropriated for the purpose and the amount necessary to cover the 
proposed contract for the current fiscal year is available for 
expenditure on account thereof.
 Any contract entered into contrary to the foregoing requirements shall be VOID.


 "Clearly then, the contract entered into by the former Mayor 
Duterte was void from the very beginning since the agreed cost for the 
project (P8,368,920.00) was way beyond the appropriated amount 
(P5,419,180.00) as certified by the City Treasurer. Hence, the contract 
was properly declared void and unenforceable in COA's 2nd Indorsement, 
dated September 4, 1986. The COA declared and we agree, that: 


 'The prohibition contained in Sec. 85 of PD 1445 (Government 
Auditing Code) is explicit and mandatory. Fund availability is, as it 
has always been, an indispensable prerequisite to the execution of any 
government contract involving the expenditure of public funds by all 
government agencies at all levels. Such contracts are not to be 
considered as final or binding unless such a certification as to funds 
availability is issued (Letter of Instruction No. 767, s. 1978). 
Antecedent of advance appropriation is thus essential to government 
liability on contracts ([
Zobel vs. City of Manila
,] 47 Phil. 
169). This contract being violative of the legal requirements 
aforequoted, the same contravenes Sec. 85 of PD 1445 and is null and 
void by virtue of Sec. 87."'
[193]
 (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)






  It is thus important to have an assurance that the funding of the 
project will continue. This assumes more significance when the budget is
 part of the national budget every year. 
 In this case however, 
the PDMB Project was not funded by the national budget. Rather, it was 
funded by a loan to be obtained, which was authorized by the PEA Board 
as early as October 4, 1999, when Resolution No. 2017 was issued 
approving the One Billion Loan Facility in the Form of Convertible Notes
 to Finance the Construction and Development of portions of the Central 
Boulevard,
[194]
 pertinent portion of which reads as follows: 



 RESOLVED FURTHER, that the following items are likewise approved, to wit:


 	The Term Sheet covering One Billion Pesos Loan Facility which 
will be in the form of Convertible Notes herein attached as Annex "A" 
 The appointment of Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) as 
Trustee of the Mortgage Trust Indenture under the terms and conditions 
as contained in their proposal herein attached as Annex "B" 
 The appointment of the law firm Picazo Buyco Tan Fider and 
Santos as legal counsel for this undertaking under the terms of their 
proposal herein attached as Annex "C"
 The extension of the mandate of Land Bank and All Asia Capital 
with regards to this undertaking for a period of six months; and 
 The interim loan of Three Hundred Million Pesos to be sourced 
from Land Bank against the One Billion Facility under such terms and 
conditions as may be agreed upon.
[195]




 The authority to contract loan is authorized under the charter of PEA, being a government instrumentality. In 
Republic v. City of ParaÃ±aque
,
[196]
 the nature of PEA, later renamed as PRA, was described as follows:



  In the case at bench, PRA is not a GOCC because it is neither a 
stock nor a non-stock corporation. It cannot be considered as a stock 
corporation because although it has a capital stock divided into no par 
value shares as provided in Section 7 of P.D. No. 1084, it is not 
authorized to distribute dividends, surplus allotments or profits to 
stockholders. There is no provision whatsoever in P.D. No. 1084 or in 
any of the subsequent executive issuances pertaining to PRA, 
particularly, E.O. No. 525, E.O. No. 654 and EO No. 798 that authorizes 
PRA to distribute dividends, surplus allotments or profits to its 
stockholders. 


PRA cannot be considered a non-stock corporation either because it 
does not have members. A non-stock corporation must have members. 
Moreover, it was not organized for any of the purposes mentioned in 
Section 88 of the Corporation Code. Specifically, it was created to 
manage all government reclamation projects. 


 Furthermore, there is another reason why the PRA cannot be 
classified as a GOCC. Section 16, Article	XII of the	1987 Constitution 
provides as follows: 




 
Section 16.
 The Congress shall not, except by general 
law, provide for the formation, organization, or regulation of private 
corporations. Government-owned or controlled corporations may be created
 or established by special charters in the interest of the common good 
and subject to the test of economic viability.




 The fundamental provision above authorizes Congress to create 
GOCCs through special charters on two conditions: 1) the GOCC must be 
established for the common good; and 2) the GOCC must meet the test of 
economic viability. In this case, PRA may have passed the first 
condition of common good but failed the second one â economic viability.
 Undoubtedly, the purpose behind the creation of PRA was not for 
economic or commercial activities. Neither was it created to compete in 
the market place considering that there were no other competing 
reclamation companies being operated by the private sector. As mentioned
 earlier, PRA was created essentially to perform a public service 
considering that it was Primarily responsible for a coordinated, 
economical and efficient reclamation, administration and operation of 
lands belonging to the government with the object of maximizing their 
utilization and hastening their development consistent with the public 
interest.
[197]
 (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) 




 Being a government instrumentality, PEA is authorized by its charter
 to contract loans to be able to carry into effect the mandate it was 
given under P.D. No. 1084. Section 5 thereof reads: 



 
Section 5.
 
Powers and functions of the Authority
. The Authority shall, in carrying out the purposes for which it is created, have the following powers and functions:


 . . . .


 (m) To enter into, make, perform and carry out contracts of every 
class and description, including loan agreements, mortgages and other 
types of security arrangements, necessary or incidental to the 
realization of its purposes with any person, firm or corporation, 
private or public, and with any foreign government or entity. (Emphasis 
in the original)




  Section 12 of P.D. No. 1084 likewise provides:



 
Section 12.
 Loans
. The Authority, as 
well as any affiliate corporation in which it holds, owns and/or 
controls by itself or jointly with one or more government-owned or 
controlled corporations at least seventy-five per cent (75%) of the 
issued and outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote, when 
specifically authorized by the President of the Philippines, is hereby 
authorized to contract loans, credits, in any convertible foreign 
currency or capital goods, and indebtedness from time to time from 
foreign governments, or any international financial institutions or fund
 sources, or any entities, on such terms and conditions as it shall deem
 appropriate for the accomplishment of its purposes and to enter into 
and execute agreements and other documents specifying such terms and 
conditions. (Emphasis in the original) 




 The PDMB Project, as funded by loan obtained by the PEA, was thus 
authorized by its charter, and whatever fond it may obtain therefrom 
could be utilized for the current fiscal year. While the Sandiganbayan 
found that dividing the project to Package 1 and Package 2 was a 
subterfuge to do away with the requirement of funding, pertinent laws 
only require that the funding of a project be viewed on a yearly basis. 
The requirement of the law is funding for the current fiscal year. Be it
 divided into several phases, as long as the project could be 
implemented within the end of the year with the corresponding amount for
 such project, the same could not be said to have violated the law. 

 The need to secure funding for the project covering the current fiscal 
year is understandable. Under Section 47 of the Administrative Code, the
 contract for the expenditure of public funds shall be for that amount 
necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current calendar year, 
thus:



 SECTION 47. 
Certificate Showing Appropriation to Meet Contract
.
 â Except in the case of a contract for personal service, for supplies 
for current consumption or to be carried in stock not exceeding the 
estimated consumption for three (3) months, or banking transactions of 
government-owned or controlled banks, no contract involving the 
expenditure of public funds by any government agency shall be entered 
into or authorized unless the proper accounting official of the agency 
concerned shall have certified to the officer entering into the 
obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for the purpose and 
that the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract for the current
 calendar year is available for expenditure on account thereat: subject 
to verification by the auditor concerned. The certificate signed by the 
proper accounting official and the auditor who verified it, shall be 
attached to and become an integral part of the proposed contract, and 
the sum so certified shall not thereafter be available for expenditure	
for	any	other	purpose	until	the obligation of the government agency 
concerned under the contract is fully extinguished. (Emphasis supplied) 




 Considering that the amount of PHP 300 million was identified as the
 budget to cover the expenses for the current year when the PDMB Project
 was to be implemented the same should already suffice as compliance 
with the requirement of the law. 
 Presidential approval
 Another ground relied upon by the Sandiganbayan in convicting petitioners is the failure to secure presidential approval. 
 A reading of the Memorandum dated January 29, 2000 from the Executive Secretary
[198]

 would show that it was an approval of the Construction Agreement with 
PEA for the construction of the Central Boulevard Road Project in the 
amount of PHP 584,365,885.05 subject to certain conditions, foremost of 
which are the inclusion of a provision in the Agreement that all extra 
works and price adjustments should first be submitted to the President 
for approval and that the final approval and actual release of the loan 
proceeds from the LandBank/All Asia Capital must be secured.
  It 
must nonetheless be clarified that the additional condition for 
presidential approval concerning extra works and price adjustments were 
imposed by the Office of the President. In the same manner, the various 
executive orders issued by the President are directives of the 
executive, which does not necessarily amount to a violation of R.A. No. 
3019. 
 Insofar as the contract itself was concerned, the approval
 of the President was already given, subject to certain conditions, 
which are in the nature of resolutory conditions. In an obligation with a
 resolutory condition, the obligation is already effective, subject to 
the happening of the condition. Thus, the approval of the president 
should already be considered as given, subject to the happening of the 
conditions it imposed, non-fulfillment of which could be a ground for 
appropriate action between entities that imposed the same and those 
required to fulfill the condition. 
 With respect to the 
determination as to whether a violation of R.A. No. 3019 occurred, such 
an infraction should first be proven to have been committed with 
manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence 
that resulted into undue injury to the government or any party, or any 
unwarranted benefit to a private party. In the absence of proof of the 
elements constituting violation of R.A. No. 3019, mere failure to comply
 with a directive of the president cannot be considered a violation of 
said criminal law. 
 Award of the Seaside Drive Extension
 
As found by the Sandiganbayan, Variation Order No. 2 comprised of the 
Inland Bridge Channel and the Seaside Drive Extension. Considering that 
it found the construction of the inland bridge channel under this 
variation order as legal and necessary for the construction of the PDMB 
Project, the same would no longer be disturbed on appeal. Rather, it is 
the award of the Seaside Drive Extension under Variation Order No. 2 
that will have to be examined. 
 Variation Orders are classified under the IRR of P.D. No. 1594 as follows: 



 CI 1 - VARIATION ORDERS - CHANGE ORDER/EXTRA WORK ORDER/SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT


 1. Variation orders may be issued by the concerned 
agency/office/corporation to cover any increase/decrease in quantities, 
including the introduction of new work items that are not included in 
the original contract or reclassification of work items that are either 
due to change of plans, design or alignment to suit actual field 
conditions resulting in disparity between the preconstruction plans used
 for purposes of bidding and the "as staked plans" or construction 
drawings prepared after a joint survey by the contractor and the 
government after award of the contract. The addition/deletion of works 
should be within the general scope of the project as bid and awarded. 
A variation order may either be in the form of a change order, extra work order or a supplemental agreement.
 (Emphasis supplied)




  No substantial change was introduced by the IRR of R.A. No. 9184
[199]
, which defined variation order as follows: 


1.	Variation Orders - Change Order/Extra Work Order


 1.1	Variation Orders may be issued by the procuring entity to 
cover any increase/decrease in quantities, including the introduction of
 new work items that are not included in the original contract or 
reclassification of work items that are either due to change of plans, 
design or alignment to suit actual field conditions resulting in 
disparity between the preconstruction plans used for purposes of bidding
 and the "as staked plans" or construction drawings prepared after a 
joint survey by the contractor and the Government after award of the 
contract, provided that the cumulative amount of the positive or 
additive Variation Order does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the 
original contract price. The addition/deletion of works under Variation 
Orders should be within the general scope of the project as bid and 
awarded. The scope of works shall not be reduced so as to accommodate a 
positive Variation Order.
 A Variation Order may either be in the form of either a change order or extra work order.
[200]
 (Emphasis supplied)




  Clearly, a change order or extra work order is considered as a form
 of variation order. Petitioners' claim that the award of the Seaside 
Drive Extension does not need the approval of the president is therefore
 erroneous. When the Memorandum and the Contract with JD Legaspi 
specified as a condition, the approval of the President before any extra
 works may be performed on the project, this includes variation orders, 
for an extra work is in reality, a form of a variation order. Suffice it
 to state, the approval of the President should have been secured before
 additional expenses on additional  works, irrespective of their 
nomenclature, may be awarded to the contractor. This is a condition 
imposed by then Executive Secretary Zamora as early as the award of the 
contract itself and made a condition in the various PEA Board 
Resolutions, and the contract itself. 
 While Executive Order No. 
109 expressly repealed Memorandum Circular No. 25, the same was issued 
only on May 27, 2002 after the presidential approval was already given. 
The Office of the President's Memorandum dated January 29, 2000, which 
approved the Construction Agreement, carried a condition that all extra 
works and price adjustments should first be submitted to the president 
for approval. Failure to secure presidential approval on the award of 
the Seaside Drive Extension thus raises a circumstance that should be 
considered in assessing whether a violation of R.A. No. 3019 occurred. 
Nevertheless, this circumstance must be examined 
vis a vis 
the elements of the law alleged to have been violated. 

Further, a variation order must still fall within the general 
scope of the project as bid and awarded. In this case, the Seaside Drive
 Extension was characterized by the Sandiganbayan as follows:



 With respect, however, to the Seaside Drive Extension under 
Variation Order No. 2, it appears that the same cannot legally qualify 
to be covered by a Variation Order. This is because it is a road outside
 of the PDMB project and nowhere along the original PDMB roadway plan. 
It is, in fact, a roadway connecting PDMB and Roxas Boulevard. As 
recommended by accused BeriÃ±a[, Jr.], the Seaside Extension Drive had to
 be constructed to ease up traffic flow to and from Roxas Boulevard. 
However, this road was never within the general scope of the PDMB 
Project as bid and awarded. Accused Millan admitted this when he 
testified that it was part of another project that was supposed to be 
implemented but fell through. The Construction Agreement only defines 
the Project as the Central Boulevard Road Project, without any mention 
of any arterial roads or any additional roadway such as the Seaside 
Drive Extension. No documents, whether it be the original action plan of
 the Boulevard Project, the Construction Agreement signed between PEA 
and accused Legaspi or the Bid Documents, show that the Seaside Drive 
Extension was envisioned to be part of the general scope of the PDMB 
Project.
[201]




  Indeed, nowhere was the Seaside Drive Extension found in any of 
the documents bid out for the PDMB Project. It was not even located 
along the stretch of President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard, but a road 
to connect the PDMB to the Roxas Boulevard, going to NAIA. A separate 
bidding for the award of the Seaside Drive Extension should thus have 
been undertaken. 
 Liability for the award of the Seaside Drive Extension

 As discussed, the irregularity involved in this case pertains to the 
award of the Seaside Drive Extension and not on the main contract for 
the PDMB Project. Thus, it is the surrounding circumstances of the award
 of this part of the project that should be examined to determine 
whether there is a violation of R.A. No. 3019. In the process of 
analysis, it bears pointing out that mere violation of the procurement 
law does not automatically make one liable for violation of R.A. No. 
3019. As explained in 
Sabaldan v. Office of the Ombudsman
:
[202]




 More importantly, it must be emphasized that the instant case 
involves a finding of probable cause for a criminal case for violation 
of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, and not for violation of R.A. No. 
9184. Hence, even granting that there may be violations of the 
applicable procurement laws, the same does not mean that the elements of
 violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 are already present as a 
matter of course. For there to be a violation under Section 3(e) of R.A.
 No. 3019 based on a breach of applicable procurement laws, one cannot 
solely rely on the mere fact that a violation of procurement laws has 
been committed. It must be shown that (1) the violation of procurement 
laws caused undue injury to any party or gave any private party 
unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference; and (2) the accused acted
 with evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable 
negligence.
[203]




 A perusal of the arguments presented by the parties shows that the 
participation of some of the petitioners revolved around the award of 
the main contract and not in the introduction of Variation Order No. 2. 
Thus, they cannot be held criminally liable therefor.
 As regards 
the liability of Amposta-Mortel, considering that there was no showing 
that the variation order in question was submitted to her for review, 
she cannot be held liable. A legal officer cannot be considered to have 
facilitated the award of an erroneous contract when the same was not 
even forwarded to her office for review. This must be so when the main 
contract itself has already undergone the appropriate review and has 
been given presidential approval.
 On the part of the Old PEA 
Board, being the governing body of the PEA tasked to formulate policy 
decisions, they had every right to rely on the report and recommendation
 of the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee as it is the members of the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee who has the first-hand knowledge of the ongoing construction 
and the actual location of the roads. In the absence of a clear showing 
of bad faith, manifest partiality or gross inexcusable negligence in the
 issuance of the Resolutions leading to the award of the Seaside Drive 
Extension, they could not have violated R.A. No. 3019.
 As 
represented by BeriÃ±a, Jr., to facilitate the flow of traffic at the 
Seaside Drive Extension, it is deemed necessary to complete the 
construction of the proposed Seaside Drive Extension (connecting Roxas 
Boulevard and Central Boulevard) and that since time is of the essence, 
it was recommended that the additional works be awarded to JD Legaspi.
[204]

 The representation of BeriÃ±a, Jr. of the need to complete the 
construction of the Seaside Drive Extension to facilitate the flow of 
traffic and its necessity, especially when time is of the essence, made 
the Board believe of the need to approve the award of the Seaside Drive 
Extension, moreso, when the road has to connect the PDMB with other 
roads.
 As it even appears, Resolution Nos. 3017 and 3102 carried 
conditions imposed by the PEA Board, which was supposed to safeguard the
 award of the Seaside Drive Extension. The conditions imposed under 
Resolution No. 3017 are as follows: 



 a.	Payment will be made only on actual quantities completed based 
on the approved detailed plans and applicable unit bid prices and agreed
 prices (on new items of works)
 
    b.	No time extensions will be associated on these additional works 

    c.	Final approval of the Office of the President as per Memo dated 29 June 2000. 

    d.	Actual release of the loan proceeds from Land Bank of the Philippines.
[205]




 As to Resolution No. 3102, the Old PEA Board, in addition to the 
previous conditions it imposed under Board Resolution No. 3017, further 
required that the implementation of Variation Order No. 2 be made 
subject to the provisions of P.D. No. 1594 while the appropriation of 
the difference resulting from the updated cost thereof must be made 
subject to existing accounting and auditing rules and regulations.
[206]
 These safeguards negate bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence on the part of the members of the Old Board of PEA.

  It must be added that the subsequent approval of the new Board of 
Directors of the cost of the project signify their acquiescence not only
 to the project but also a recognition of the safeguards that were 
already put in place by the Old Board.
  On the part of BeriÃ±a, 
Jr. and Millan, who issued the request for Variation Order No. 1 (later 
renumbered as Variation Order No. 2),
[207]

 the actions they took negate manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or
 gross inexcusable negligence. In proposing the construction of the 
Seaside Drive Extension, they have honestly believed that P.D. No. 1594 
allows a negotiated contract where a variation order is adjacent or 
contiguous to an ongoing project and could be economically prosecuted by
 the same contractor. Further, from the ground and aerial sketches, the 
Integrated Framework Plan and the present Google image of the President 
Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard, the Seaside Drive Extension appears to be 
connected to JD Legaspi's PDMB Project.
 Indeed, a negotiated 
contract is allowed where the variation order to be introduced is 
adjacent or contiguous to an ongoing project. Thus, even if the main 
contract as bid out did not include the Seaside Drive Extension, the 
same may still be introduced as a variation order as part of a 
negotiated contract. The law however requires certain requirements, to 
wit: 



 IB 10.6.2  - By negotiated Contract


 . . . .


 c. Where the subject project is adjacent or contiguous to an 
ongoing project and it could be economically prosecuted by the same 
contractor provided that subject project has similar or related scope of
 works and is within the contracting capacity of the contractor, in 
which case, direct negotiation may be undertaken with the said 
contractor at the same unit prices adjusted to price levels prevailing 
at the time of negotiation using the parametric formulae herein 
prescribed without the 5% deduction and contract conditions, less 
mobilization cost, provided that he has no negative slippage and has 
demonstrated a satisfactory performance.
[208]
 




Hence, the introduction of the Seaside Drive Extension is not without
 legal basis. While it would appear that said road does not fall along 
the stretch of the PDMB Project, this fact alone cannot serve as a basis
 to hold petitioners liable for violation of R.A. No. 3019. To stress, 
the focal point in determining whether there is a violation of R.A. No. 
3019 is the elements comprising it, one of which is the existence of 
manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. 
These were defined as follows:




 Under the third element, the crime may be committed through 
"manifest partiality," "evident bad faith," or "gross inexcusable 
negligence." As already held by this Court, Section 3(e) of RA 3019 may 
be committed either by dolo, as when the accused acted with evident bad 
faith or manifest partiality, or by culpa, as when the accused committed
 gross inexcusable negligence. There is "manifest partiality" when there
 is a clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor 
one side or person rather than another. "Evident bad faith" connotes not
 only bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and 
dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some
 perverse motive or ill will. "Evident bad faith" contemplates a state 
of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive 
or self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purposes. "Gross 
inexcusable negligence" refers to negligence characterized by the want 
of even the slightest care, acting or omitting to act in a situation 
where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and 
intentionally, with conscious indifference to consequences insofar as 
other persons may be affected.
[209]
 (Citations omitted)




 Here, the Seaside Drive Extension was constructed at a portion of 
the PDMB in order to have a road that will connect it to the Roxas 
Boulevard. It is not a road construction that is totally alien to the 
PDMB Project, for it is still a road that is connected to the main 
project, and serves as a link to the other roads going to and from the 
President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard. With a legal basis for which the
 actions taken by petitioners were anchored, it cannot be said that 
their actions were coupled with a clear inclination to favor another or 
that a conscious wrongdoing, ill-will or dishonest purpose was being 
committed.
 The same must also be said as to the absence of 
presidential approval for the introduction of Variation Order No. 2. 
Such a finding does not automatically equate to a violation of R.A. No. 
3019, considering the failure of the prosecution to show that it was 
accompanied by manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross 
inexcusable negligence. To stress, the main contract has already been 
approved by the president. Likewise, taking into consideration the 
nature of a negotiated contract by which the award of the additional 
works must necessarily be given to the contractor of the main project 
provided the requisites are present, reliance on the provision of 
negotiated contracts by BeriÃ±a, Jr. and Millan negates the element of 
evident bad faith, manifest partiality or gross inexcusable negligence. 
Necessarily, if the PDMB Project was awarded to JD Legaspi, any 
negotiated contracts related thereto should also be awarded to him by 
operation of law. As such, with the passage of P.D. No. 1594, the 
requirement of presidential approval for the award of a subsequent 
project believed to be qualified as a negotiated contract, would be 
rendered unnecessary. Considering however that such an approval for 
subsequent works has been required by the Office of the President when 
it approved the main project, any infraction thereon would only be 
subject to the exercise of discretion of the said Office. With respect 
to violation of R.A. No. 3019, the good faith reliance of BeriÃ±a, Jr. 
and Millan as to the necessity of the Seaside Drive Extension and their 
appreciation of the application of P.D. No. 1594 as to negotiated 
contracts, would not make them liable for violation thereof on account 
merely of the absence of presidential approval of the award of the 
Seaside Drive Extension.
 The need to prove all the elements of 
the crime of R.A. No. 3019, as in all other cases of violation of 
criminal laws, springs from the constitutional presumption of innocence.
 As elaborated in 
Villarosa v. People
:
[210]




 The settled rule is that conviction in criminal actions demands 
proof beyond reasonable doubt. This rule places upon the prosecution the
 task of establishing the guilt of an accused, relying on the strength 
of its own evidence, and not banking on the weakness of the defense of 
an accused. Indeed, the burden is on the prosecution to prove guilt 
beyond reasonable doubt, not on the accused to prove his innocence. 
Requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt finds basis not only in the due 
process clause of the Constitution, but similarly, in the right of an 
accused to be "presumed innocent until the contrary is proved." 
Undoubtedly, it is the constitutional presumption of innocence that lays
 such burden upon the prosecution. (Citations omitted)
[211]




 With respect to Legaspi, the Sandiganbayan also convicted him for 
violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 because of its finding of 
implied conspiracy, holding that the PEA Management would not have 
presented the same to the Board had Legaspi not submitted documents 
pertaining to the possibility of constructing the same as a change order
 to the original Construction Agreement, thereby violating all the 
public bidding rules in place.
[212]
 
 In 
Tan v. People
,
[213]
 this Court explained the liability of private individuals charged with violation of R.A. No. 3019, to wit:



 Private persons, when acting in conspiracy with public officers, 
may be indicted and, if found guilty, held liable for the pertinent 
offenses under Section 3 of R.A. 3019, including (e) thereof. This is in
 consonance with the avowed policy of the anti-graft law to repress 
certain acts of 
public officers and private persons
 alike constituting graft or corrupt practices act or which may lead thereto. 


 Thus, for a private person to be charged with and convicted of 
Violation of certain offenses under Section 3 of R.A. 3019, which in 
this case (e), it must be satisfactorily proven that he/she has acted in
 conspiracy with the public officers in committing the offense; 
otherwise, he/she cannot he so charged and convicted thereof.


 In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all; thus, it is never
 presumed. Like the physical acts constituting the crime itself, the 
elements of conspiracy must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. To 
establish conspiracy, direct proof of an agreement concerning the 
commission of a felony and the decision to commit it is not necessary. 
It may be inferred from the acts of the accused before, during or after 
the commission of the crime which, when taken together, would be enough 
to reveal a community of criminal design, as the proof of conspiracy is 
frequently made by evidence of a chain of circumstances. 
While 
direct proof is not essential to establish conspiracy, it must be 
established by positive and conclusive evidence. And conviction must be 
founded on facts, not on mere inferences and presumptions.
[214]
 (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)




 A reading of the assailed Decision and Resolution would however show
 that the only basis relied upon by the Sandiganbayan in concluding that
 Legaspi had a part in the award of the Seaside Drive Extension was the 
Sworn Statement as attached to the Counter-Affidavit of Tagud, which was
 taken judicial notice of, stating that it was Legaspi who proposed to 
PEA the construction of the Seaside Drive Extension.
[215]

 It must be noted however that neither the Sworn Statement nor the 
Counter Affidavit of Tagud was shown to have been offered as evidence by
 the prosecution. The Rules of Court specifically provides that evidence
 must be formally offered to be considered by the court. Evidence not 
offered is excluded in the determination of the case. Failure to make a 
formal offer within a considerable period of time shall be deemed a 
waiver to submit it.
[216]
 The same cannot also be taken judicial notice of because it does not fulfill the condition of notoriety. In 
State Prosecutors v. Judge Muro
,
[217]
 judicial notice was explained as follows:



 The doctrine of judicial notice rests on the wisdom and discretion
 of the courts. The power to take judicial notice is to be exercised by 
courts with caution; care must be taken that the requisite notoriety 
exists; and every reasonable doubt on the subject should be promptly 
resolved in the negative. 


 Generally speaking, matters of judicial notice have three material
 requisites: (1) the matter must be one of common and general knowledge;
 (2) it must be well and authoritatively settled and not doubtful or 
uncertain; and (3) it must be known to be within the limits of the 
jurisdiction of the court. The provincial guide in determining what 
facts may be assumed to be judicially known is that of notoriety. Hence,
 it can be said that judicial notice is limited to facts evidenced by 
public records and facts of general notoriety. 


 To say that a court will take judicial notice of a fact is merely 
another way of saying that the usual form of evidence will be dispensed 
with if knowledge of the fact can be otherwise acquired. This is because
 the court assumes that the matter is so notorious that it will not be 
disputed. But judicial notice is not judicial knowledge. The mere 
personal knowledge of the judge is not the judicial knowledge of the 
court, and he is not authorized to make his individual knowledge of a 
fact, not generally or professionally known, the basis of his action. 
Judicial cognizance is taken only of those matters which are "commonly" 
known.


 Things of "common knowledge," of which courts take judicial 
notice, may be matters coming to the knowledge of men generally in the 
course of the ordinary experiences of life, or they may be matters which
 are generally accepted by mankind as true and are capable of ready and 
unquestioned demonstration. Thus, facts which are universally known, and
 which may be found in encyclopedias, dictionaries or other 
publications, are judicially noticed, provided they are of such 
universal notoriety and so generally understood that they may be 
regarded as forming part of the common knowledge of every person.
[218]
 (Citations omitted) 




 The affidavit of Tagud cannot be taken judicial notice of because it
 is not a product of common experience in the ordinary course of things.
 No practice has been established for a contractor to ask for additional
 works in a project. Rather, the contents of Tagud's affidavit requires 
the presentation of evidence to prove the actions allegedly taken by 
Legaspi to ensure that the Seaside Drive Extension would be awarded to 
him. In the absence of such evidence, this Court cannot take at face 
value, the allegations in the affidavit of Tagud. 
 Further, the 
Sandiganbayan found that Legaspi proceeded to construct the Seaside 
Drive Extension without receiving an approval from the Office of the 
President as stated in their Construction Agreement. Suffice it to state
 however, that such an obligation does not fall on Legaspi, being the 
contractor. 
 Legaspi cannot therefore be held liable for the award of the Seaside Drive Extension. 
 With respect to the payments made to JD Legaspi, the same is justified on the basis of 
quantum meruit
 as expounded in 
Melchor v. Commision On Audit
,
[219]
 to wit: 



 Moreover, a variation order (which	may	take	the	form	of a change 
order, extra work or supplemental agreement) is a contract by itself and
 involves the expenditure of public funds to cover the cost of the work 
called for thereunder. (Fernandez, A Treatise on Government Contracts 
under Philippine Law, 115-116 [1985]) As such, it is subject to the 
restrictions imposed by Sections 85 and 86 of PD 1445 and LOI 968. COA 
Circular No. 80-122, dated January 15, 1980, likewise ensures that an 
extra work order is approved only when supported by available funds. 
Again, the petitioner has not presented proof of an appropriation to 
cover the extra work order. 


 For a failure to show the approval by the proper authority and to 
submit the corresponding appropriation, we declare the contract for 
extra works null and void. 


 Section 87 of PD 1445 states: 




 "Any contract entered into contrary to the requirements of the two immediately preceding sections shall be void, and the 
officer
 or officers entering into the contract shall be liable to the 
government or other contracting party for any consequent damage to the 
same extent as if  the transaction had been wholly between private 
parties
." (Italics supplied) 




 This does not mean, however, that the petitioner should be held 
personally liable and automatically ordered to return to the government 
the full amount of P172,003.26.


 As previously discussed, it would be unjust to order the 
petitioner to shoulder the expenditure when the government had already 
received and accepted benefits from the utilization of the building.


 In 
Royal Trust Construction v. Commission on Audit, supra,

 cited by the petitioner, the Court, in the interest of substantial 
justice and equity, allowed payment to the contractor on a quantum 
meruit basis despite the absence of a written contract and a covering 
appropriation. 


 In a more recent case, 
Dr. Rufino O. Eslao v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 89745, April 8, 1991
,
 the Court directed payment to the contractor on a quantum meruit basis 
despite the petitioner's failure to undertake a public bidding. In that 
case, the Court held that "to deny payment to the contractor of the two 
buildings which are almost fully completed and presently occupied by the
 university would be to allow the government to unjustly enrich itself 
at the expense of another." 


 Where payment is based on quantum meruit, the amount of recovery 
would only be the reasonable value of the thing or services rendered 
regardless of any agreement as to value. (Tantuico, State Audit Code of 
the Philippines Annotated, 471 [1982])


 Although the two cases mentioned above contemplated a situation 
where it is the contractor who is seeking recovery, we find that the 
principle of payment by quantum meruit likewise applies to this case 
where the contractor had already been paid and the government is seeking
 reimbursement from the public official who heads the school. If, after 
COA determines the value of the extra works computed on the basis of 
quantum meruit, it finds that the petitioner made an excess or improper 
payment for these extra works, then petitioner Melchor shall be liable 
only for such excess payment.
[220]
 




 While the variation orders performed by Legaspi may have been done 
in advance, this does not deprive him, moreso, make him liable for 
payment of the cost of the project, especially that the public is now 
reaping the benefits of the said road construction. The principle of 
quantum meruit

 thus applies, and as the COA found no irregularity in the amount paid 
to him by the government, such amount should no longer be returned. 
Moreover, the contract price adjustment in the amount of PHP 
42,418,493.64 was considered reasonable by the COA.
[221]


 As to the civil liability of petitioners,
 Cabrera v. People
[222]
 discussed the basis of civil liability for violation of R.A. No. 3019 as follows:



 The
 first
 punishable act is that the accused is said to 
have caused undue injury to the government or any party when the latter 
sustains actual loss or damage, which must exist as a fact and cannot be
 based on speculations or conjectures. The loss or damage need not be 
proven with actual certainty. However, there must be "some reasonable 
basis by which the court can measure it." Aside from this, the loss or 
damage must be substantial. It must be "more than necessary, excessive, 
improper or illegal."


 The 
second
 punishable act is that the accused is said to 
have given unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference to a private 
party. Proof of the extent or
 quantum
 of damage is not thus essential. It is sufficient that the accused has given "unjustified favor or benefit to another."
[223]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Here, there was no undue injury to the government or any party, or 
any unwarranted benefit that was proven by the prosecution. The 
government cannot be said to have suffered an actual loss since there 
was no showing that it had to perform acts prejudicial to its interest 
that would pertain to the loan obtained by PEA, or to the construction 
of the President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard. To the contrary, the 
timely completion of the project resulted into a benefit in favor of the
 government with the increase in value of the land surrounding the area,
 as well as the public who continue to reap the benefits of having 
alternate routes that would let them avoid traffic congestion.
 
Likewise, no circumstance was shown to favor JD Legaspi in the award of 
the main contract and the variation orders that would amount to an 
unwarranted benefit in his favor. It is undeniable that the contract for
 the main project underwent the necessary procurement procedure. As to 
the award of the Seaside Drive Extension, the same was brought about by 
the honest belief of petitioners that it fell within the parameters of a
 negotiated contract. Under the rules on negotiated contract, a project 
may be awarded to the same contractor who was awarded with the ongoing 
project. Considering that JD Legaspi was awarded with the main contract,
 there is nothing irregular for the petitioners, believing in good faith
 as to the applicability of the rules on negotiated contracts, to award 
the Seaside Drive Extension to JD Legaspi. Thus, there was no 
unwarranted benefit that favored JD Legaspi in the award of the Seaside 
Drive Extension.
 With the foregoing, the civil liability imposed by the Sandiganbayan upon the petitioners should be deleted.

DISSENTING OPINION






 LEONEN, 
SAJ
.:


 I dissent.
 The public bidding process is imbued with 
public interest. Individuals involved in the bidding process have an 
important responsibility to ensure compliance with the relevant bidding 
rules and regulations. I disagree with the majority's decision to acquit
 petitioners and to remove their civil liability. 
 The 
Sandiganbayan convicted petitioners of violation of Republic Act No. 
3019, Section 3(e). It found that, taking the totality of petitioners' 
conduct, the irregularities in the bidding process resulted in undue and
 unwarranted benefits or advantage to petitioner Jesusito Legaspi, with 
evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence.
[1]
 According to the Sandiganbayan, the basis for their conviction are:

	Violating the simplified bidding rules because they shortlisted bidders not based on the PCAB master list. 
Conducting the bidding and recommending the award to Legaspi 
without [detailed] engineering in violation of P.D. 1594 and without the
 required appropriation and actual availability of funds for the total 
contract price.
Creating and confirming the artificial phases in the Construction 
Agreement and dividing the contract into Phase I and Phase II just to 
enable PEA to circumvent the requirement under P.D. No. 1445 about 
funding requirements. 
In the case of BeriÃ±a and Millan, recommending the approval of 
Variation Order No. 2 and the contract price adjustment, and the payment
 thereof, without the required presidential approval and in violation of
 P.D. No. 1594.
 In the case of San Juan, Chan, Dayan, Malbarosa, Padilla and 
Damaso, for approving and confirming the Legaspi contract without 
sufficient funding and the Seaside Drive Extension without public 
bidding. 
In the case of Legaspi, for conspiring with BeriÃ±a and Millan in 
having the Seaside Drive Extension contract awarded to him under a 
negotiated contract.
[2]


 The President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard was part of a flagship 
project (the Project) for the construction of a five-kilometer highway 
traversing the reclaimed area from Buendia Avenue to Pacific Avenue.
[3]

 Due to the project's importance, the then Chairperson of the Public 
Estates Authority (now Philippine Reclamation Authority) requested the 
Office of the President for authority to bid and award the project 
through simplified bidding. This request was approved through the 
Memorandum issued by then Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora.
[4]
 As noted by the Sandiganbayan, under a simplified bidding process, participation was limited to "
bona fide

 contractors duly accredited and classified for the project category and
 size and who are included in a separate list to be prepared by the 
Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board."
[5]

 Thus, despite the simplified procedure, safeguards were still put in 
place with the involvement of the Philippine Contractors Accreditation 
Board, the agency which grants, suspends, and revokes licenses to 
contractors,
[6]
 to ensure the qualification of the contractors that were to bid in the projects.

  Despite this, the Public Estate Authority chose to limit its 
bidders to a shortlist of 10 contractors, provided not by the Philippine
 Contractors Accreditation Board as expressly required, but a list of 10
 contractors given by the Department of Public Works and Highways.
[7]
 The 
ponencia
,
 however, concludes that petitioners were left with no choice but to 
consult the list given by the Department of Public Works and Highways 
because the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board list was not yet 
existent. In absolving petitioners, the 
ponencia
 asserts: "[a] 
negative fact, such as the absence of the masterlist, cannot serve as a 
basis for a wrongdoing, when the prosecution itself has not first 
presented proof of its existence."
[8]
 I disagree.

 The unavailability of the list by the Philippine Contractors 
Accreditation Board was not a reason to deviate from the standard 
procedure and get a separate list from the Department of Public Works 
and Highways. There is no substantial compliance, as the
 ponencia
 puts it,
[9]

 since there was no compliance at all. There is no mechanism or 
provision that authorizes the substitution of the Philippine Contractors
 Accreditation Board list by another list.

 Moreover, as the Sandiganbayan has found, the entire project was
 divided into two separate packages for purposes of the simplified 
bidding without any rational basis.
[10]

 Package 1 included part of the Project that was eventually awarded to 
petitioner Legaspi, while Package II covered part of the Project where 
the Public Estates Authority had a prior joint venture agreement with 
SM, Inc. and R1 Consortium. This joint venture agreement allowed the two
 developers the option to construct that portion of the Project in 
exchange for lands or bonds. Thus, the continuation of Package II of the
 Project depended on the decision of SM, Inc. and R1 Consortium of 
whether they will pursue the Project themselves or not.
[11]

 Petitioner Legaspi's company was put in the list of contractors for 
Package I just because it was number two in the list by the Department 
of Public Works and Highways. The latter five of the 10 contractors were
 assigned as prequalified contractors for Package II, again without 
basis. This arbitrary decision led to unwarranted benefits in favor of 
petitioner Legaspi.

 As explained by the graft court:



 [T]hose contractors assigned for the Package II bidding were, from
 the start, disadvantaged because of the great possibility that Package 
II could not be bid out because of the option open to SM and R1 
consortium.	 In turn, those contractors which were assigned for Package 
I, were favored	 by PEA's arbitrary decision because, just by their 
being listed ahead in the DPWH list, they were certain to be able to bid
 and in the case of Legaspi, win the award for Package I. This alone 
gave undue advantage to the first set of contractors and prejudiced the 
second set. Had PEA included all ten (10) of the DPWH listed contractors
 for both Package I and II, no such advantage or prejudice would have 
resulted. Better still, if PEA followed P.D. 1594 by including ALL 
qualified contractors accredited by the PCAB in its master list in the 
simplified bidding, then no question of impropriety could arise.


 JD Legaspi Construction, which was number 2 in the DPWH list 
therefore, gained an advantage or benefit, as it was able to bid and win
 Package I, to the disadvantage of those contractors in the second set 
of the DPWH list and also those PCAB accredited contractors in the 
latter's master list, who were not included in the DPWH list.


 Moreover, PEA's fear that a contractor could get both Package I 
and II of the Boulevard project was not completely averted because 
during the course of Legaspi's implementation of its contract, PEA 
approved Variation Order No. 2 in favor of Legaspi. This included the 
Inland Channel Bridge which was originally part of Package II but was 
later turned down to be built by R1 Consortium. Variation Order No. 2 
also included the Seaside Drive Extension connecting PDMB to Roxas 
Boulevard... No additional bidding was done for the additional works 
under Variation Order No. 2. Legaspi, therefore, was given unwarranted 
benefits and/or advantage by PEA.
[13]




 Moreover, there were no detailed engineering plans when petitioner 
Raphael Pocholo Zorilla prepared the Approved Agency Estimate, and the 
Public Estates Authority bid out and awarded the Project. The 
ponencia
 makes the same observation that this clearly contravenes Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1594, which reads:



 Section 2. Detailed Engineering. 
No bidding and/or award
 of contract for a construction project shall be made 
unless the detailed engineering investigations, surveys, and designs for the project have been sufficiently carried out

 in accordance with the standards and specifications to be established 
under the rules and regulations to be promulgated pursuant to Section 12
 of this Decree so as to minimize quantity and cost overruns and 
underruns, change orders and extra work orders, 
and unless the detailed engineering documents have been approved

 by the Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communications, the
 Minister of Public Highways, or the Minister of Energy, as the case may
 be. (Emphasis supplied)




 However, the 
ponencia
 absolves petitioner for this 
violation because it finds that there was no clear showing of bad faith,
 malice, or gross negligence.
[14]


 Further, the Sandiganbayan also found that there was no 
appropriation and sufficient funds to finance the project at the time 
the Public Estates Authority approved the signed Construction Agreement 
with petitioner Legaspi.
[15]
 
All it had was a Board Resolution identifying the source of fundsâthe 
PHP 1 billion loan facility from Land Bank of the Philippines and All 
Asia Capital Groupâbut the loan was not yet existent because it was 
still under negotiation at that time.
[16]

 By the time the Construction Agreement was signed, dated, and 
notarized, only PHP 300 Million was actually released as proceeds of the
 loan from the Land Bank of the Philippines; this was still below the 
actual contract cost of PHP 584,365,855.05.
[17]

  Additionally, the Sandiganbayan found that splitting the Project into 
two phases was only a ploy to circumvent this defect, but this defect 
remained as Phase II of the project since it "could be undertaken only 
if and when funds are made available again."
[18]
 And indeed, the Public Estates Authority ran out of funds, and could not pursue the remaining works.
[19]
  The 
ponencia
,
 however, maintains that the law only requires that project funding be 
viewed on a yearly basis, irrespective of whether the project is divided
 into several phases. As long as a portion of the project could be 
implemented by the end of the fiscal year with the corresponding amount 
to cover for that portion, there is no violation of the law.
[20]


 As to the lack of presidential approval for contract price 
adjustments as required by the Memorandum by Executive Secretary Zamora,
 the 
ponencia
 finds that these were violations of directives 
from the Executive that do not necessarily amount to violations of the 
law. In any case, it claims that such infraction was not "proven to have
 been committed with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross 
inexcusable negligence... [M]ere failure to comply with a directive of 
the president cannot be considered a violation of ... criminal law."
[21]


  However, as to the award of the Seaside Drive Extension under Variation Order No. 2 of the Construction Agreement, the 
ponencia

 agrees that presidential approval was required because this variation 
order constituted a change order or extra work order under the 
Implementing Rules of Republic Act No. 9184. This is because the 
construction of the Seaside Drive Extension did not fall within the 
general scope of the original project; nowhere was the Extension found 
in any of the bidding documents for the President Diosdado Macapagal 
Boulevard Project, nor was it even located along the stretch of the 
Boulevard.	Accordingly, a separate award for the Seaside Drive Extension
 should have been undertaken.
[22]


 Despite this, the 
ponencia
 absolves petitioners, saying
 they had no participation in the award of Variation Order No. 2, 
specifically petitioners Cristina Amposta-Mortel and Zorilla.
[23]


 The 
ponencia
 also finds there was no clear showing of 
bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence in the 
bid and award for Variation Order No. 2.
[24]
 Particularly, the 
ponencia

 states that members of the old Board of Directors of the Public Estates
 Authority, particularly petitioners Daniel T. Dayan, Frisco F. San 
Juan, Elpidio G. Damaso, Legaspi, and Carmelita Chan, "had every right 
to rely on the report and recommendation of the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee" when it issued the Resolutions leading to the award of the Seaside Drive Extension under Variation Order No. 2.
[25]


  As to the members of the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee, specifically petitioners Manuel BeriÃ±a Jr. and Jaime R. Millan, the 
ponencia

 holds that they "honestly believed that P.D. No. 1594 allows a 
negotiated contract where a variation order is adjacent or contiguous to
 an ongoing project and could be economically prosecuted by the same 
contractor."
[26]
 This also justified the lack of presidential approval.
[27]


 I disagree with the 
ponencia
's finding of clearing petitioners of criminal and civil liability. The Sandiganbayan's decision should be affirmed.

 Petitioner Amposta-Mortel's position as Manager of the Public 
Estates Authority's Legal Department requires her to review and 
recommend the legal instruments that involve her agency. Her signatures 
in these instruments precisely signifies her participation, because they
 are certifications that she had read and understood these documents. As
 head of the Legal Department, her signature therefore meant that she 
had reviewed the original Construction Agreement despite being aware of 
the lack of funds for the transaction. Her role is not simply to be a 
''rubber stamp" to the Agreement, as the Sandiganbayan puts it.
[28]

 The Sandiganbayan also notes her admissions in her Memorandum, where 
she merely relied on the approval of the Office of the Government 
Corporate Counsel and the Public. Estates Authority's Board of Directors
 without having an independent assessment of the Agreement. "Even a 
cursory reading of the Construction Agreement against the Zamora 
Memorandum would yield a finding of inconsistency, which should have 
raised red flags in the mind of [Amposta-Mortel]."
[29]

 Her argument that she merely reviews matters which are brought to her 
attention only further reveals her omission to act in instances where 
her participation was necessary. She should be found guilty of the 
charge.
 The conviction of petitioner Zorilla, being the one who 
prepared the Approved Agency Estate for the Project despite lack of 
detailed engineering, should likewise be upheld. Preparing this despite 
the lack of a detailed engineering plan is not simple negligence; this 
is a crucial part in formulating an Approved Agency Estimate.
[30]

 As to petitioners who were part of the old Board of Directors of the 
Public Estates Authority, namely petitioners Leo V. Padilla, Dayan, San 
Juan, Damaso, Legaspi, and Chan, they should be convicted for their acts
 of issuing Resolutions approving (1) the contract to Legaspi despite 
the absence of actual loan proceeds, (2) the Variation Order No. 2 
despite lack of bidding, and (3) the increase on the cost of Variation 
Order No. 2. The Sandiganbayan also found that they failed to question 
the Public Estates Authority Management on why the contract was divided 
into two phases when what they approved was an "undivided" contract.
[31]
 Moreover, their reliance on the report and recommendation of the 
Ad Hoc
 Committee is misplaced.	While 
Arias v. Sandiganbayan
[32]

 ruled that "[a]ll heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable	extent 
on their subordinates and on good faith of those who prepare bids, 
purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations," this is subject to a 
qualification. In 
Abubakar v. People
[33]
:



 The application of the doctrine is subject to the qualification 
that the public official has no foreknowledge of any facts or 
circumstances that would prompt him or her to investigate or exercise a 
greater degree of care. In a number of cases, this Court refused to 
apply the 
Arias
 doctrine considering that there were circumstances that should have prompted the government official to inquire further.
[34]
 (Citations omitted)




 The irregularities attending the bidding process for both the 
President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard Project and the Seaside Drive 
Extension under Variation Order No. 2 should have prodded them, at the 
very least, to investigate further. Their conviction should be upheld.

 Additionally, petitioners Lacson, BeriÃ±a, Viray, and Millan were the 
persons responsible for the supervision of the Project. They were 
directly involved in the planning and execution of the project.
 Petitioners Lacson, BeriÃ±a, and Viray, as part of the 
Ad Hoc
 
Committee
,
 "prepare[d] the bid documents, evaluate[d] the bidders' qualifications,
 evaluate[d] their submitted bids, and recommend[ed] plans, 
specifications, invitations to bid, pre-qualifications, and all 
pre-construction and construction activities to the Board for approval."
[35]

 Meanwhile, petitioner Millan, who acted as Assistant General Manager, 
was in charge of the "evaluation, processing, and approval of bids of 
contractors, progress billings, and payments."
[36]
 Having direct participation in the prohibited acts, their convictions should also be affirmed.

 Finally, as to petitioner Legaspi, who is a private individual, 
the Sandiganbayan found that there was no evidence to show that he 
conspired with the other petitioners during the start of the Project. It
 was the Public Estates Authority's management, specifically the 
Ad Hoc

 Committee, that designed the splitting of the Project in to two phases.
 Nevertheless, petitioner Legaspi pushed for the recommendation and 
approval of Variation Order No. 2, so that his company could be awarded 
the construction of the Seaside Drive Extension. He also claimed for 
"overruns which made the final bill for the project 43% higher than that
 of the original contract price."
[37]

 It was his prompting that led the Public Estates Authority's management
 to present Variation Order No. 2 for the Seaside Drive Extension to the
 Board as a simple change order to the original contract, thereby 
violating the rules on public bidding.
[38]

 Moreover, petitioner Legaspi proceeded with the construction of the 
Seaside Extension Drive despite the lack of a Notice to Proceed and 
presidential approval, in contradiction to the requirement under the 
original Construction Agreement. These "surrounding circumstances and 
legal provisions all yield to the same conclusion that there was implied
 conspiracy between [petitioner] Legaspi and the [Public Estates 
Authority's] management."
[39]
 Despite these, the 
ponencia

 rules that the prosecution failed to prove they acted with manifest 
partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, and 
acquits petitioners.
 For a conviction of violation of Section 3(e), the following elements must be present:

	The accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions;
 He [or she] must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or [gross] inexcusable negligence;
That his [or her] action caused any undue injury to any party, 
including the government, or giving any private party unwarranted 
benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.
[40]


 The 
ponencia
 found that the prosecution failed to show 
corrupt motives in the irregularities committed during bidding and award
 of the President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard Project, as well as the 
Seaside Drive Extension under Variation Order No 2. It assessed this 
element as against petitioners' individual acts. I disagree.

 In 
Abubakar
[41]
:



 The second element provides the modalities by which a violation of
 Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 may he committed." Manifest 
partiality," "evident bad faith," or "gross inexcusable negligence" are 
not separate offenses, and proof of the existence of any of these three 
(3) "in connection with the prohibited acts . . . is enough to convict."
[42]




 Thus, independent proof of the second element is not necessary. 
Manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence 
can be proven through the manner by which the prohibited acts are 
committed. In other words, these "merely describe the mode by which the 
offense penalized in Section 3(e) of the statute may be committed."
[43]

 The Sandiganbayan was correct in looking at the totality of 
petitioners' conducts to find the presence of manifest partiality, 
evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence. After all, corrupt 
practices are often done through a series of discrete acts that, when 
taken together, reveal ill motives.
 The construction of the 
President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard was a flagship infrastructure 
project, and this huge undertaking by the national government involved 
large sums of money. "The rules on competitive bidding and those 
concerning the disbursement of public funds are imbued with public 
interest. Government officials whose work relates to these matters	are	
expected	to	exercise	greater	responsibility	in	ensuring compliance with 
the pertinent rules and regulations."
[44]
 
ACCORDINGLY
, I vote to 
DENY

 the Petitions. The Sandiganbayan Decision and Joint Resolution dated 
February 5, 2015 and September 16, 2015 finding petitioners Cristina 
Amposta-Mortel, Theron Victor V. Lacson, Leo V. Padilla, Manuel BeriÃ±a, 
Jr., Jaime R. Millan, Bernardo T. Viray, Raphael Pocholo A. Zorilla, 
Daniel T. Dayan, Frisco F. San Juan, Elpidio G. Damaso, Carmelita D. 
Chan, and Jesusito Legaspi guilty of violation of Republic Act No. 3019 
should be 
AFFIRMED
