With the presence of the aggravating/qualifying circumstance that the complainant is a fourteen (14) years [sic] old minor at the time of the commission of the offense.
Contrary to law.
[10]

That on or about the 23
rd

, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit an act of sexual assault on the person of the complainant, [AAA], a fourteen (14) year old minor, by inserting his finger to the vagina of said complainant against the latter's will and consent.
Contrary to law.
[11]
Criminal Case No. 07-147
[For rape under paragraph 1 of Article 266-A of the RPC in relation to RA 7610]
That on or about the 26
th
 day August 2006 in 
xxxxxxxxxxx
, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force, threat and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of complainant, [AAA], a fourteen (14) year old minor, against the latter's will and consent.
Contrary to law.
[12]
Accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to all charges.
[13]
 The RTC resolved to consolidate the three cases,
[14]
 and joint proceedings ensued.
Version of the Prosecution:
Accused-appellant was employed as a stay-in family driver during the time material to the cases.
The first incident (Criminal Case No. 07-146) transpired at around 2:00 a.m. of August 23, 2006. AAA was 14 years old at that time. She testified that she was suddenly awakened when accused-appellant entered her room; she recognized him because of the ambient light coming from the outside.
[15]
 She then asked him what he was doing in her room, to which he did not respond.
[16]
 Instead, he covered her mouth, then kissed her neck and lips.
[17]
 She tried to resist and avoid his kisses, but he was aggressive.
[18]
 He proceeded to insert his hand in her shirt and mashed her breasts.
[19]
 He then inserted his finger in her vagina.
[20]
After the act, accused-appellant threatened AAA not to tell anyone about the incident, otherwise, he will kill her and her family.
[21]
 Thereafter, AAA woke up her younger sister BBB
[22]
 (with whom she shares the room), and asked her to accompany her (AAA) in the bathroom so she can wash herself.
[23]
 AAA did not tell anybody about the incident as she was afraid of the threats made by accused-appellant.
[24]
The second incident (Criminal Case No. 07-147) happened during the wee hours of the morning of August 26, 2006, only a few days after the first incident. AAA testified that she was awakened when accused-appellant again entered her room and covered her mouth.
[25]
 He pulled up her shirt and kissed her breasts, and then removed her jogging pants and underwear.
[26]
Afterwards, accused-appellant inserted his penis into AAA's vagina for about five to 10 minutes.
[27]
 She tried to stop him, but to no avail as he was much stronger.
[28]
 When accused-appellant finished, he again threatened her not to tell anyone or else he will kill her and her family.
[29]
 After accused-appellant left the room, AAA again woke BBB up and asked her to accompany her (AAA) to the bathroom so she can wash herself.
[30]
The third incident (Criminal Case No. 06-809) occurred during the early hours of the morning of September 2, 2006. AAA testified that accused-appellant again entered her room.
[31]
 Accused-appellant locked the door and proceeded to carry out his plans.
[32]
 AAA was awakened when he kissed her lips and neck.
[33]
 She again pleaded for him to stop, but to no avail.
[34]
 He mashed her breasts.
[35]
 She tried to wake BBB up who was sleeping on the other bed, but was not successful.
[36]
 Accused-appellant continued the assault and proceeded to insert his finger in her vagina.
[37]
Meanwhile, CCC,
[38]
 a nursemaid in AAA's household, woke up and went to the maid's quarters to change her clothes as she was peed on by AAA's four year old sister.
[39]
 CCC stated that at that time, she heard a door being locked.
[40]
 After changing clothes, she noticed that accused-appellant was not in his bed.
[41]
 CCC woke the other maids up and they checked if accused-appellant went out of the house.
[42]
 As the gates were still locked, they looked for him inside the house.
[43]
 CCC proceeded to AAA and BBB's room and she noticed that the door was locked. CCC became anxious because the sisters do not usually lock the door in their room and at the same time, accused-appellant was missing.
[44]
 CCC knocked on the door and called on to AAA and BBB, but no one answered for a time.
[45]
 CCC kept on knocking and calling out AAA and BBB until AAA opened the door.
[46]
Inside the room, accused-appellant was alarmed when he heard the knocking on the door; thus, he instructed AAA to pull up her pajama and underwear.
[47]
 Accused-appellant tried to hide under the bed but he was too big to fit.
[48]
 So he just sat down beside BBB's bed and asked AAA to open the door.
[49]
 AAA opened the door and CCC saw accused-appellant sitting on the side of BBB's bed.
[50]
CCC angrily asked accused-appellant what he was doing inside the room in the middle of the night with the door locked.
[51]
 Accused-appellant explained that he was just patting BBB to sleep.
[52]
Notably, Police Senior Inspector (PSI) Marianne Ebdane (PSI Ebdane) conducted a medical examination on AAA. PSI Ebdane found deep healed lacerations at the five and seven o'clock positions on AAA's hymen, which show clear evidence of blunt penetrating trauma to the hymen.
[53]
Version of the Defense:
Accused-appellant denied the charges against him.
For the first and second incidents (August 23 and 26, 2006), accused-appellant claimed that he was nowhere near the room of AAA as he was sleeping inside his quarters located at the first floor of the house.
[54]
As to the third incident (September 2, 2006), accused-appellant admitted that he was indeed inside AAA's room.
[55]
 He, however, claimed that he did not molest the child.
[56]
 He explained that the night before, on September 1, he and AAA were waiting inside the car for CCC, who was buying medicines in a drugstore, when suddenly, AAA had an asthma attack.
[57]
 Accused-appellant stated that she told him not to tell anyone about the asthma attack.
[58]
 When they returned, AAA also told him not to leave her.
[59]
 Thus, he returned to her room (in the morning of the next day, September 2) to check her condition.
[60]
Accused-appellant added that he could not think of any reason why they would file a case against him; except that his good intention of checking on AAA was taken with malice.
[61]
 He stated that AAA's family treats him well, gives him his salary, and that they had a good relationship.
[62]
Ruling of the Regional Trial Court:
In its November 5, 2014 Joint Decision,
[63]
 the RTC found accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt on all charges. First, the trial court gave more credence on the testimonies of AAA and CCC as against the mere denial of accused-appellant.
[64]
 Second, accused-appellant did not deny that he was in the residence during the material dates; he even admitted that he was inside AAA's room on the date of the third incident.
[65]
 The RTC likewise found accused-appellant's excuse of checking on the complainant for asthma unbelievable.
[66]
 Third, there is no reason for AAA to concoct a story of sexual molestation.
[67]
 The RTC also held that the acts of locking the door of AAA's room and not opening it immediately when CCC knocked show that accused-appellant intended to commit sexual acts against AAA.
[68]
 Lastly, there is no reason for accused-appellant not to tell AAA's parents about the asthma attack.
[69]
 Accused-appellant does not have any medical background; thus, if he really was concerned about AAA's condition, he should have just informed her parents about it.
[70]
Aggrieved, accused-appellant appealed the case to the CA.
[71]
 In his brief,
[72]
 he attacked AAA's credibility and pointed out that her testimony was not corroborated as her sister BBB (with whom she shares the room) and their parents (whose room was next to hers) were not presented.
[73]
 BBB and their parents could have heard AAA's squeals during the act even if her mouth was covered. Accused-appellant also claimed that there was a "window of opportunity" for the complainant to scream and wake BBB up before her mouth was covered.
[74]
 It was expected that a normal 14 year old girl would have screamed upon seeing a potential rapist.
[75]
The prosecution (through the Office of the Solicitor General) filed its appellee's brief.
[76]
 The prosecution countered that there is no clear-cut behavior that can be expected of a person being sexually abused or has been abused.
[77]
 Further, the trial court's assessment of the witnesses must be given great respect, especially testimonies of child victims of sexual abuse.
[78]
 Lastly, the prosecution reiterated that accused-appellant's defense of denial fails in light of AAA's positive testimony and identification of him in court.
[79]
Ruling of the Court of Appeals:
In its March 30, 2017 Decision,
[80]
 the CA affirmed the RTC Joint Decision, with modification on the amounts of the civil indemnities, damages, and fines to be paid by accused-appellant for all convictions. The CA notably added that the non-presentation of AAA's sister and parents is not fatal to the case; conviction may be based on the sole testimony of the victim as long as it is logical, credible, consistent, and convincing, which is the case here.
[81]
 Further, the testimony was corroborated by the medico-legal findings showing deep healed lacerations.
[82]
 AAA's failure to shout for help should not be taken against her as people react differently to highly stressful situations such as the incidents in this case.
[83]
 There is also no showing of any ill motive on the part of AAA and her family against accused-appellant; thus, the testimony of AAA should be accorded full weight and credit.
[84]
The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:

Still aggrieved, accused-appellant elevated his case to this Court.
[85]
 The parties opted to no longer file supplemental briefs.
[86]
Issue
The issue is whether the conviction of accused-appellant on all charges is proper.
Our Ruling
There is no merit in the appeal. The Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction on all charges.
Article 266-A of the RPC provides how rape is committed:
Article 266-A. 
Rape; When And How Committed.
 â Rape is Committed â
 
 
 
1) 
 
 
By a   man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) 
 
 
Through force, threat, or intimidation; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
b) 
 
 
When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
c) 
 
 
By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
d)
 
 When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2)
 
By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person. 
 
 
Based on the provision, there are two modes of committing Rape: (a) Rape through sexual intercourse as provided in paragraph one; and, (b) Rape through sexual assault as provided in paragraph two.
The elements of rape under paragraph one are as follows: (1) the accused had carnal knowledge of the victim; and, (2) the act was accomplished (a) through the use of force or intimidation, or (b) when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or (c) when the victim is under 12 years of age or is demented.
[87]
On the other hand, the elements of the second mode of rape are as follows: (1) the accused committed an act of sexual assault by (a) inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or (b) inserting any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; and, (2) the act was accomplished (a) through the use of force or intimidation, or (b) when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or (c) when the victim is under 12 years of age or is demented.
[88]
 Carnal knowledge is the operative act that distinguishes the first mode from the second mode.
In the instant case, the Court is convinced that all the elements of both offenses as appropriately charged against accused-appellant were present.
At the outset, the trial court is in the best position to evaluate the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor, conduct, and attitude under grilling examination.
[89]
 The Court is therefore generally bound by the findings of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the appellate court, in the absence of any misapprehension of facts that would warrant the reversal of the lower court's findings.
[90]
Here, the RTC is correct in finding AAA a credible witness and in ruling that all the elements of both offenses were present. AAA was able to identify accused-appellant in open court as the perpetrator in the three incidents. She was able to narrate in a clear and straightforward manner what had happened during the three incidents that she was assaulted by accused-appellant.
The relevant portions of her testimony regarding the first incident are as follows:

What did the accused told [sic] you, Ms. Witness?
 
 
 
A:
 
"Wag kang maingay, 'wag kang magsasabi kahit kanino kung hindi papatayin ko kayo."
[93]
 
 
AAA was able to clearly narrate that in the early morning of August 23, 2006, accused-appellant entered her room and assaulted her by inserting his finger in her vaginaâthereby satisfying the first element of performing sexual assault by inserting an object into a person's genital. AAA likewise stated that accused-appellant pinned her down and employed intimidation by threatening her not to tell anybody about the deed or else, he will kill her and her familyâthereby satisfying the second element by performing the sexual assault through force or intimidation. Thus, this Court is convinced that the elements were present for the first charge.
For the second chargeâthis time Rape through sexual intercourseâthe trial court again was correct in finding AAA a credible witness. The relevant portions of her testimony regarding the second incident are as follows:

A:

 The accused put his penis into your vagina, is that correct?

 Yes, sir. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
 Can you still remember, [AAA], for how long did the accused insert his penis into your vagina? 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
 Five to ten minutes, sir. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
 
And he did that repeatedly, is that correct? 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
 
Yes, sir. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 Did you consent to what the accused was doing to you? 
 
 
 
A: 
 
No, sir. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
 Did you try to stop the accused from what he was doing to you? 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
 Yes, sir, but he was too strong. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
 
After five to ten minutes, what did the accused do? 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
 
He stood up and then threw my jogging pants and my panty to me and said, "Wag kang magsasabi kahit kanino kundi papatayin ko kayo." 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
 
After the incident, what happened next, if any? 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
 
I woke up my sister again, sir. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
 
After waking up your sister, what happened next, Ms. Witness? 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
 
I washed my body and I felt something bleeding, sir. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
 What was that bleeding? Where was the bleeding coming out [sic], Ms. Witness? 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
 In my vagina, sir. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x x x x 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q: 
 
 
What was the threat which you are afraid of, [AAA]? 
 
 
 
 
A: 
 
 
"Wag kang magsasabi kahit kanino kung hindi papatayin ko kayo." 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q:
 
 
And that specific statement came out of the accused, is that correct? 
 
 
 
A: 
 
Yes, sir.

Once again, AAA was able to narrate in a clear and straightforward manner the rape that had transpired. AAA testified that accused-appellant inserted his penis into her vaginaâthereby satisfying the first element of carnal knowledge. For the second element, it can be gleaned from the testimony that accused-appellant again employed force and intimidation to perform the rape. AAA stated that accused-appellant covered her mouth and that she tried to fight back, but to no avail because of his strength. Further, she recalled that accused-appellant again uttered threats of killing her and her family. And notably, she clearly stated that she did not consent to having sexual intercourse with accused-appellant. Thus, the Court is convinced that the elements of rape through sexual intercourse are present in the second charge.
With regard to the third charge, which is again sexual assault, the RTC was once again accurate in finding AAA a credible witness. The relevant portions of her testimony regarding the third incident are as follows:

Here, AAA was again able to narrate that accused-appellant inserted his finger into her vaginaâthereby satisfying the first element of performing sexual assault through insertion of an object into a person's genital. Notably for the second element, there was no narration during the direct testimony of the offended party regarding the employment of force or intimidation. However, it can be gleaned during the cross-examination and questioning by the trial court that accused-appellant indeed continued to threaten her during the third incident. It was clarified that accused-appellant employed threats even during the third incident. AAA answered in the affirmative when the counsel for the accused-appellant asked her during cross-examination if accused-appellant threatened her during each of the incidents (including the third time). AAA also answered in the affirmative when asked by the RTC regarding the third incident. Thus, the Court is satisfied that the second element of employing intimidation is present in the third charge.
In sum, the Court affirms the RTC's assessment of the witness, AAA, regarding the narration of the events that transpired during those three nights. In addition, it must be remembered that a child's testimony on sexual abuse deserves great respect, thus:
x x x When the offended party is of tender age and immature, courts are inclined to give credit to her account of what transpired, considering not only her relative vulnerability but also the shame to which she would be exposed if the matter to which she testified is not true. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity. Errorless recollection of a harrowing incident cannot be expected of a witness, especially when she is recounting details of an experience so humiliating and so painful as rape. What is important is that the victim's declarations are consistent on basic matters constituting the elements of rape and her positive identification of the person who did it to her.
[98]
Further, AAA's account was corroborated by the medico-legal report issued by PSI Ebdane. The report stated that AAA's vagina suffered deep healed lacerations at the five and seven o'clock positions of the hymen, which show clear evidence of blunt penetrating trauma.
[99]
 It is settled that when the offended party's testimony is corroborated by physical findings of penetration (which in this case are the fingers and the penis), there is sufficient basis to conclude that sexual intercourse (and sexual abuse) had occurred.
[100]
On accused-appellant's defense of denial, the Court finds it feeble. The defense of denial is inherently weak due to the ease with which it can be concocted; it cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by the victim.
[101]
 Case law provides that "mere denial, unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is [a] negative self-serving evidence which cannot be given greater evidentiary weight than the testimony of the complaining witness who testified on affirmative matters."
[102]
Accused-appellant claimed that as to the first two alleged incidents, he was not in AAA's room because he was sleeping in his quarters. However, the defense failed to substantiate or corroborate this claim. No one saw him sleeping in his quarters during those times. Thus, it is not impossible for accused-appellant to not be in AAA's room at those times.
As for the third incident, accused-appellant admitted that he was inside the room. He claimed, however, that he did not assault AAA and that he was merely checking in on her asthma. Again, his assertion remains uncorroborated. In fact, his admission that he was inside the room is altogether inconsistent with his denial. Also, CCC corroborated that accused-appellant was indeed inside the room. While CCC did not have personal knowledge of the sexual assault itself, she had personal knowledge of accused-appellant's presence inside the room as she saw that he was sitting on CCC's bed when the door was opened. More importantly, AAA's positive identification of accused-appellant on all three incidents defeats the latter's weak defense of denial.
The Court likewise finds that the other contentions raised by accused-appellant do not cast reasonable doubt on his guilt.
On the issue on the non-presentation as witnesses of AAA's parents and sisters, it is settled that "a conviction for rape may be upheld based on a complainant's testimony when it is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things."
[103]
 As already shown, the Court here finds AAA's testimony sufficient to be the primary basis of accused-appellant's conviction for all charges.
Accused-appellant also raised the behavior of AAA during and after the incidents. To recall, the offended party failed to report the incidents to her mother or other housemates until the third incident. Further, accused-appellant claimed that AAA's squeals, even if her mouth was covered, should have been heard by her parents (whose room is next to hers) and her sister (with whom she shares the room), and that there was a "window of opportunity" for her to scream before he covered her mouth. In this regard, there is no standard form of behavior for a rape victim. A victim's behavior and reaction cannot be predicted accurately; people react differently to a given situation.
[104]
 Not all rape victims can be expected to act according to the usual expectation of the majority.
[105]
Considering all the foregoing, the Court affirms accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt on all two counts of Rape through sexual assault and one count of Rape through sexual intercourse.
At this juncture, the Court deems it necessary to correct the nomenclature of the crimes charged and to impose the proper penalties.
It is undisputed that AAA was 14 years old at the time of the commission of the three offenses. This fact calls for the application of RA 7610.
In 
People v. Tulagan
[106]
 (
Tulagan
), the Court summarized the applicable laws and penalties for the crimes of Acts of Lasciviousness or Lascivious Conduct and Rape through sexual intercourse or sexual assault, depending on the age of the victim, in view of the provisions of paragraphs one and two of Article 266-A and Article 336 of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, and Section 5(b) of RA 7610.
[107]
In instances where the lascivious conduct committed against a child covered by RA 7610, and the act is covered by sexual assault under paragraph two Article 266-A of the RPC, the offender shall be liable for violation of Section 5 (b) of RA 7610.
[108]
 
Tulagan
, citing 
People v. Caoili
,
[109]
 provides for the proper nomenclature of the crime of Rape through sexual assault and the imposable penalty if the victim is more than 12 years of age but below 18 years of age:
In 
People v. Caoili
, We prescribed the following guidelines in designating or charging the proper offense in case lascivious conduct is committed under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610, and in determining the imposable penalty:
The age of the victim is taken into consideration in designating or charging the offense, and in determining the imposable penalty.
x x x x
If the victim is 
exactly twelve (12) years of age, or more than twelve (12) but below eighteen (18) years of age
, or is eighteen (18) years old or older but is unable to fully take care of herself/himself or protect herself/himself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition, the crime should be designated as "
Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610
," and the imposable penalty is 
reclusion temporal in its medium period to 
reclusion perpetua
.
x x x x
Whereas if the victim is 12 years old and under 18 years old, or 18 years old and above under special circumstances, the nomenclature of the crime should be "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610" with the imposable penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua, but it should not make any reference to the provisions of the RPC
. It is only when the victim of the sexual assault is 18 years old and above, and not demented, that the crime should be called as "Sexual Assault under paragraph 2, Article 266-A of the RPC" with the imposable penalty of 
prision mayor
.
[110]
If the victim is 12 years old and under 18 years old, and the acts committed fall under rape through sexual assault under the RPC, the proper nomenclature is "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610." The imposable penalty is 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period to 
reclusion perpetua
.
As for Rape through sexual intercourse, and the victim is 12 years old and under 18 years old, 
Tulagan
 again instructs that the proper nomenclature is "Rape under Article 266-A (1) in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC," and the imposable penalty is 
reclusion perpetua
.
[111]
To recap, the Court finds that Rape through sexual assault was committed in Criminal Case Nos. 06-809 and 07-146. Considering that AAA was 14 years old at the time of the commission of the acts, the Court changes the nomenclature of the two charges to "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610." Resultantly, the Court modifies the penalty imposed by the appellate court; after all, an appeal of a criminal case throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing court can increase the penalty to conform with what is provided by the violated penal law."
[112]
 For Criminal Case No. 06-809, accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months of 
reclusion temporal
, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum.
[113]
 The same sentence shall be imposed for Criminal Case No. 07-146.
As for the Rape through sexual intercourse in Criminal Case No. 07-147, the Court revises the nomenclature of the offense to "Rape under Article 266-A (1) in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC" or Simple Rape. The CA did not err in imposing the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.
The Court also modifies the imposition of civil indemnities, damages, and fines to conform with 
Tulagan
 and 
People v. Jugueta
.
[114]
 For Criminal Case No. 06-809, accused-appellant is ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages. For Criminal Case No. 07-146, accused-appellant is likewise ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages. For Criminal Case No. 07-147, accused-appellant is ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages. All amounts are subject to six percent (6%) legal interest that will commence to run from the finality of this Decision until full payment thereof. The fines imposed by the appellate court for all cases shall be deleted for lack of legal basis.
[115]

 the appeal is 
DISMISSED.
