JONAH MALLARI Y SAMAR, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.

LEONEN, J.:


When a person being apprehended by a police 
officer resists or uses force that is not dangerous, grave, or severe, 
the offense is not direct assault under Article 148 of the Revised Penal
 Code. Instead, the proper offense is resistance and disobedience to an 
agent of a person in authority, penalized under Article 151 of the 
Revised Penal Code.
 This Court resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari
[1]
 questioning the Decision
[2]
 and Resolution
[3]
 of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed with modification the Municipal Trial Court
[4]

 and the Regional Trial Court's
[5]
 conviction of Jonah Mallari y Samar 
(Mallari) for the crime of direct assault upon an agent of a person in 
authority.
 An Information was filed against Mallari on May 31, 2007.
[6]
 It read:
  


 That on or about the Twelfth (12
th
) day of January 
2007, in the City of Olongapo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused while being pacified by
 PO2 Richard F. Navarro who was a duly qualified and appointed police 
officer of Olongapo City and while the latter was in the actual 
performance of his official duties, that is, maintaining peace and order
 in the said locality, and the said accused well knowing before and 
during the assault that PO2 Richard F. Navarro who was a duly appointed 
police officer, as such, an agent of a person in authority, did then and
 there willfull, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack, kick and 
slap said police officer.


 CONTRARY TO LAW.
[7]






 Mallari pleaded not guilty to the charge during her arraignment. Trial then ensued.
[8]


 The prosecution presented the victim, Police Officer 2 Richard
 Navarro (PO2 Navarro), along with Senior Police Officer 3 Melanio Merza
 (SPO3 Merza) and Dr. Rolando Mafel Ortiz (Dr. Ortiz), as its witnesses.
[9]


 The incident transpired on the early morning of January 12, 
2007. According to the prosecution, at around 6:45 a.m., the Olongapo 
Police Station 3 received a report of an altercation on the ground floor
 of GenX Billiard Hall on Gordon Avenue. At this, PO2 Navarro and SPO3 
Merza, who were both in uniform, went to the scene. There, they found 
two (2) groups of women fighting and pulling each other's hair out, 
among them a visibly drunk Mallari. The officers rushed to stop the 
fight.
[10]


 Once the squabble was over, the officers asked the women to go
 to the police station to file proper complaints. However, the 
intoxicated Mallari shouted at them, "
Wala kayo pakialam sa akin, hindi aka sasama sa inyo.
"
[11]

 She then grabbed PO2 Navarro by the collar, slapped his cheek, and 
kicked his legs several times. To restrain her, PO2 Navarro held her by 
the shoulders and brought her to the back of the patrol car. SPO3 Merza 
was about to pacify the other women, but they eventually agreed to go to
 the police station. The incident was entered in the blotter and Mallari
 was detained for direct assault.
[12]


PO2 Navarro was treated at the James Gordon Memorial Hospital for the minor injuries he got from Mallari.
[13]
 Dr. Ortiz issued him a medical certificate stating that he had sustained swelling on the zygomatic area, or the cheekbone.
[14]


The defense presented the sole testimony of Mallari.
[15]


 Mallari testified that at around 6:00 a.m. that day, she and 
her co-workers were singing at a karaoke bar in GenX Billiard Hall when 
they got into a heated argument with another group of women, which then 
escalated to a physical fight. The ruckus prompted the bar owner to send
 the women downstairs, but their fighting only continued.
[16]


Later, Mallari added, the police arrived and ordered them to 
board the patrol car. Mallari initially obeyed, but after noticing that 
her companions did not, she alighted from the vehicle. PO2 Navarro 
pushed her back in by holding her stomach and the collar of her blouse. 
When she still attempted to alight, PO2 Navarro grabbed her by the 
ankles, spreading her legs open in the process. When he pulled her down,
 she hit her head and neck on the vehicle's floor, her buttocks hitting 
the ground.
[17]


After composing herself from the embarrassment, Mallari boarded
 the car and went with the officers to the police station. There, she 
was surprised that PO2 Navarro claimed that she had slapped him several 
times. She then called her mother and went to the hospital for a medical
 examination.
[18]
 She was found to have sustained the following injuries:           
  


 Contusion 2x2 cm medical aspect M/3 left forearm 

    Contusion 2x2 cm medical aspect P/3 left forearm
 
    Contusion 2x2 cm post aspect D/3 left forearm 

    Contusion 0.5x0.5 cm antero-medical aspect M/3 right forearm
 
    Abrasion 2 cm interscapular area
 
    Swelling left thenar eminence.
[19]




 Mallari later filed a Complaint against PO2 Navarro and SPO3 Merza
 for unlawful arrest, illegal detention, maltreatment of prisoners, and 
physical injuries. This was eventually dismissed by the Office of the 
Prosecutor.
[20]


 In its September 5, 2013 Decision,
[21]

 the Municipal Trial Court found Mallari guilty beyond reasonable doubt 
of direct assault upon an agent of a person in authority. It noted that 
Mallari admitted to kicking PO2 Navarro and grabbing his shirt while he 
was performing his official duties. It likewise gave premium to the 
prosecution's positive testimony against Mallari's defense of denial.
[22]
 The dispositive portion of the Decision read:  
  


 
WHEREFORE
, 	foregoing	considered, judgment	is	hereby rendered finding accused 
JONAH MALLARI y SAMAR, 
GUILTY

 beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Direct Assault upon an Agent of
 a Person in Authority and hereby sentences her to suffer an 
imprisonment of
 
prision correccional i
n
 its medium period of 3 yrs, 6 mos and 21 days to 4 years, 9 mos and 10 
days and to pay the fine of PHp1,000.00. With costs against the accused.
 


SO DECIDED.
[23]
 (Emphasis in the original)   




 The Regional Trial Court affirmed Mallari's conviction in its July 30, 2014 Decision.
[24]

 It found that all the elements of the offense were present: PO2 Navarro 
was an agent of a person in authority, and Mallari kicked, slapped, and 
injured him while he was engaged in the performance of his official 
duty. It found that no improper motive could be traced to the 
prosecution's witnesses who clearly testified on the matter. It also 
noted that Mallari's defenses and denials were weak and uncorroborated.
[25]


 The Court of Appeals, in its October 27, 2015 Decision,
[26]
 affirmed with modification the Regional Trial Court's Decision, thus:  
  


 
WHEREFORE
, the instant petition is hereby 
DISMISSED
 for lack of merit. The 
Decision 
dated July 30, 2014 of the RTC, Branch 74, Olongapo City, in Criminal Case No. 44-14 is hereby 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
 as to the imposable penalty. 


Petitioner Jonah Mallari y Samar is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of two (2) months of 
arresto mayor
 as minimum, to two (2) years and four (4) months of 
prision correccional
 as maximum. He is likewise ordered to pay a fine of Five Hundred (Php500.00) Pesos. 


SO ORDERED.
[27]
 (Emphasis in the original)




 In ruling so, the Court of Appeals found that PO2 Navarro's 
testimony was credible and clear on how the incident occurred, while 
Mallari was unable to substantiate her claims. It held that Mallari was 
the aggressor and PO2 Navarro was only compelled to restrain her as she 
was kicking him.
[28]


The Court of Appeals denied Mallari's Motion for Reconsideration in a May 12, 2016 Resolution.
[29]


Thus, Mallari filed before this Court a Petition for Review on Certiorari,
[30]
 claiming that the Court of Appeals erred in sustaining her conviction.     
  
 Petitioner argues that PO2 Navarro's testimony that she 
repeatedly kicked and slapped him was inconsistent with his injury of a 
slightly swollen cheekbone.
[31]

 She points out that it was she who suffered several injuries, 
consistent with her allegation that PO2 Navarro "held her feet, pulled 
her to the ground and caused her to hit her head, neck and buttocks,"
[32]
 despite no aggression coming from her. Thus, she says that her testimony should have been given more credence.
[33]


Assuming that she did kick PO2 Navarro, petitioner asserts that
 she was fully justified in doing so as the officer unnecessarily held 
her feet, which constitutes unlawful aggression on her honor and 
dignity.
[34]


 The Office of the Solicitor General, on behalf of respondent 
People of the Philippines, argued back that the Petition must be denied 
as it raises a question of fact, which is not proper in a petition for 
review on certiorari.
[35]


 	 In any case, the Office of the Solicitor General insists 
that petitioner's assault on PO2 Navarro was sufficiently established. 
It points out that the medical certificate stating that PO2 Navarro had a
 slightly swollen cheekbone does not negate his testimony that he was 
repeatedly kicked by petitioner, as she herself admitted attacking the 
officer. It also raises the other officers' testimonies affirming what 
had happened. From the totality of evidence, the Office of the Solicitor
 General argues that Mallari is the aggressor and her denials are weak 
defenses.
[36]
 That PO2 Navarro
 was a police officer on official duty when petitioner assaulted him 
completes the elements of the offense charged.
[37]


 For this Court's resolution is the sole issue of whether or 
not petitioner Jonah Mallari y Samar is guilty beyond reasonable doubt 
of direct assault upon an agent of a person in authority. 
 This Court modifies the ruling of the Court of Appeals. 

 We affirm that the prosecution's evidence is sufficient to uphold the 
findings of fact against petitioner. Questions of fact may no longer be 
raised in Rule 45 petitions. In 
Spouses Miano v. Manila Electric Company
:
[38]




 The Rules of Court states that a review of appeals filed before 
this Court is "not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion."
 The Rules of Court further requires that only questions of law should 
be raised in petitions filed under Rule 45 since factual questions are 
not the proper subject of an appeal by 
certiorari
. It is not this
 Court's function to once again analyze or weigh evidence that has 
already been considered in the lower courts.   


 
Bases Conversion Development Authority v. Reyes 
distinguished a question of law from a question of fact: 




 Jurisprudence dictates that there is a "question of law" when 
the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain set of
 facts or circumstances; on the other hand, there is a "question of 
fact" when the issue raised on appeal pertains to the truth or falsity 
of the alleged facts. The test for determining whether the supposed 
error was one of "law" or "fact" is not the appellation given by the 
parties raising the same; rather, it is whether the reviewing court can 
resolve the issues raised without evaluating the evidence, in which 
case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is one of fact. In other 
words, where there is no dispute as to the facts, the question of 
whether or not the conclusions drawn from these facts are correct is a 
question of law. However, if the question posed requires a re-evaluation
 of the credibility of witnesses, or the existence or relevance of 
surrounding circumstances and their relationship to each other, the 
issue is factual. 


 . . . .




 Prevailing jurisprudence uniformly, holds that findings of facts
 of the trial court, particularly when affirmed by the Court of Appeals,
 are binding upon this Court. It is not the function of this Court to 
analyze or weigh such evidence all over again. It is only  in 
exceptional cases where this Court may review findings of fact of the 
Court of Appeals.
[39]
 (Citations omitted)




 In this case, the Municipal Trial Court, the Regional Trial Court,
 and the Court of Appeals all consistently found that petitioner slapped
 and kicked PO2 Navarro while he was on official duty as a police 
officer.
[40]
 The lower courts 
arrived at this conclusion after thoroughly examining both parties' 
evidence. This Court will no longer disturb their uniform findings.

 However, petitioner should not be held guilty of direct assault, but 
rather, of the crime of resistance or disobedience under Article 151 of 
the Revised Penal Code. 
 Article 148 of the Revised Penal Code defines and penalizes direct assault: 
  


 ARTICLE 148. 
Direct assaults. 
 â Any person or persons 
who, without a public uprising, shall employ force or intimidation for 
the attainment of any of the purposes enumerated in defining the crimes 
of rebellion and sedition, or shall attack, employ force or seriously 
intimidate or resist any person in authority or any of his agents, while
 engaged in the performance of official duties, or on occasion of such 
performance, shall suffer the penalty of
 prision correccional 
in 
its medium and maximum periods and a fine not exceeding 1,000 pesos, 
when the assault is committed with a weapon or when the offender is a 
public officer or employee, or when the offender lays hands upon a 
person in authority. If none of these circumstances be present, the 
penalty of
 prision correccional 
in its minimum period and a fine not exceeding 500 pesos shall be imposed.




 Direct assault may be committed in two (2) ways: 
  


 [F]irst, by any person or persons who, without a public 
uprising, shall employ force or intimidation for the attainment of any 
of the purposes enumerated in defining the crimes of rebellion and 
sedition; and second, by any person or persons who, without a public 
uprising, shall 
attack, employ force, or seriously intimidate or 
resist any person in authority or any of his agents, while engaged in 
the performance of official duties, or on occasion of such performance
.
[41]
 (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)




 In this case, petitioner is charged with the second mode of assault. Its elements are the following:
  


 1. That the offender (a) makes an attack, (b) employs force, (c)
 makes a serious intimidation, or (d) makes a serious resistance. 


2. That the person assaulted is a person in authority or his agent. 


3. That at the time of the assault the person in authority or his
 agent (a) is engaged in the actual performance of official duties, or 
[b] that he is assaulted by reason of the past performance of official 
duties.


 4. That the offender knows that the one he is assaulting is a person in authority or his agent in the exercise of his duties. 


5. That there is no public uprising.
[42]
 




A police officer is an agent of a person in authority.
[43]

 An agent of a person in authority is one who, "by direct provision of 
law or by election or by appointment by competent authority, is charged 
with the maintenance of public order and the protection and security of 
life and property, such as barrio councilman, barrio policeman and 
barangay leader, and any person who comes to the aid of persons in 
authority[.]"
[44]
 Being a police officer, PO2 Navarro is an agent of a person in authority. 


 Petitioner was also aware that PO2 Navarro was a police officer. 
He introduced himself as one and was in his police uniform. He was 
performing his official duties as a police officer when he was pacifying
 the melee, and right when petitioner attacked him. Thus, the second, 
third, fourth, and fifth elements of direct assault are present in this 
case. 
 However, the first element of the offense is not present. 

 To be considered as direct assault, the laying of hands or the use of 
physical force against the agent of a person in authority must be 
serious. 
 In 
United States v. Gumban
,
[45]

 this Court held that the amount of force employed against agents of 
persons in authority spells the difference between direct assault and 
resistance of disobedience: 
  


 In reaching this conclusion, we took into account the decision 
rendered by this court in the case against Gelacio Tabiana and Canillas,
 in which it is said that the distinction between an assault and a 
resistance to agents of authority lies largely in the 
amount of the 
force employed in each case, and that a sudden blow given to a policeman
 while engaged in effecting an arrest does not constitute that 
employment of force which is punishable as assault
. We have also 
considered the decision rendered by this court in the case against 
Cipriano Agustin . . . in which it was also held that a blow upon a 
policeman was not an aggression amounting to an assault. It must be 
remembered, however, that in these two cases the crime involved was that
 of assault upon agents of authority, in which the essential element is 
substantially the force employed. It is said in these two cases 
that 
any force is not sufficient to constitute an assault[,] but that it is 
necessary to consider the circumstances of each case to decide whether 
the force used is, or is not, sufficient to constitute assault upon an 
agent of authority
.
[46]
 (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) 




 Previous convictions for direct assault against an agent of a 
person in authority involve force that is more severe than slapping and 
punching. In 
United States v. Cox
,
[47]

 the accused "seized [the police officer] by the throat, threw him to 
the ground, and struck him several blows with the club which he 
succeeded in wresting from the policeman[.]"
[48]


 In 
Rivera v. People
,
[49]

 the accused repeatedly hurled menacing threats against the police 
officer, challenged him to a fight, and scored a punch on the lip as 
they grappled. The officer sustained an injury that would take several 
days to heal, while the accused was only subdued with the help of other 
police officers. Thus:  
  


 ... the accused pointed a finger on the policeman and uttered words like "
Babalian kita ng buto
" (I'll break your bones). "
Ilalampaso kita
" (I'll scrub you). "
Pulis lang kayo
"
 (you are only policemen) and other unsavory and insulting words. 
Inspector Leygo who was a little bit angry warned the accused to stop 
uttering further insulting words and cautioned him to take it easy and 
then informed him that he was being arrested for violation of the 
chicken dung ordinance. The accused removed his jacket, placed it inside
 the vehicle, assumed a fighting stance and challenged the policeman. 
Inspector Leygo then approached the accused and warned him anew that he 
was being arrested. The accused responded by punching Inspector Leygo on
 his face, particularly on his lip. The two then grappled as Inspector 
Leygo tried to hold the accused. Finally, with the help of Policemen 
Dayap and Bongcado, the accused was subdued. The accused was then pushed
 into one of the police cars but he resisted until Alfredo Castro, one 
of the chicken dung dealers in the area, boarded the police car to 
accompany him.


 . . . In the medico-legal certificate (Exhibit "A") of Inspector
 Leygo, his injury described as "contusion with 0.5 laceration , upper 
lip, left side" with healing period from 5 to 7 days. Subsequently, this
 present case was filed against the accused.
[50]




 As clarified in 
People v. Breis
,
[51]

 if the use of physical force against agents of persons in authority is 
not serious, the offense is not direct assault, but resistance or 
disobedience:
  


 The laying of hands or using physical force against agents of 
persons in authority when not serious in nature constitutes resistance 
or disobedience under Article 151, and not direct assault under Article 
148 of the RPC. This is because the gravity of the disobedience to an 
order of a person in authority or his agent is measured by the 
circumstances surrounding the act, the motives prompting it and the real
 importance of the transgression, rather than the source of the order 
disobeyed. The pushing of IO1 Mangili is not of such serious defiance to
 be considered direct assault, but is resistance nonetheless.
[52]
 (Citations omitted) 




 Resistance or disobedience is punished under Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code, which provides: 
  


 ARTICLE 151. 
Resistance and disobedience to a person in authority or the agents of such person
. â
The penalty of arresto mayor

 and a fine not exceeding 500 pesos shall be imposed upon any person who
 not being included in the provisions of the preceding articles shall 
resist or seriously disobey any person in authority, or the agents of 
such person, while engaged in the performance of official duties. 


 When the disobedience to an agent of a person in authority is not of a serious nature, the penalty of 
arresto menor
 or a fine ranging from 10 to 100 pesos shall be imposed upon the offender. 




 For this crime to be proven, the two (2) key elements must be 
shown: "(1) That a person in authority or his agent is engaged in the 
performance of official duty or gives a lawful order to the offender; 
and (2) That the offender resists or seriously disobeys such person or 
his agent."
[53]
 
 In 
United States v. Tabiana
,
[54]

 where the accused hit the police officer with his fist, this Court 
explained the rationale behind the distinction in the force used: 
  


 Upon the whole we find the defendant Tabiana guilty of 
resistance and serious disobedience to public authority under article 
252, Penal Code, and not of the more serious offense indicated in 
subsection 2 of article 249, Penal Code, which was applied by the Court 
of First Instance. The question whether an offense consists of simple 
resistance or to grave resistance is to be determined with a view to the
 gravity of the act proved and the particular conditions under which 
committed. In considering this question reference should also be had to 
the nature and extend of the penalties attached by the authors of the 
Code to the different offenses. Thus, when it is observed that the 
offense indicated in article 249 carries with it a penalty ranging from 
prision correccional
 to 
prision mayor

 in its minimum degree, with corresponding fines, it is obvious that the
 lawmaker here had in mind serious offenses, characterized in part at 
least by the spirit of aggression directed against the authorities or 
their agents. . . . 


 The greatest hesitancy which we have felt in applying article 
252 instead of article 249 to this case arises from the words "shall 
employ force against them" (
emplearen fuerza contra ellos
) 
contained in article 249. These words, taken without reference to the 
context, would seem to make absolutely necessary the application of 
article 249 in every case where any degree of force is exerted. We 
believe, however, that the words quoted are to be understood as applying
 to 
force of a more serious character
 than that employed in the 
present instance. We are led to this conclusion not only because of the 
grave penalty attached, as indicated above, but for the further reason 
that the Code mentions grave resistance further on in the same paragraph
 and also makes special provision for the offense of simple resistance 
in article 252. Now practically and rationally considered in connection 
with the subject of arrest, resistance is impossible without the 
employment of some force. A man may abscond or evade or elude arrest, or
 may disobey the commands of an officer without using force but he 
cannot resist without using force of some kind or in some degree. If at 
the ultimate moment no force is employed to resist, there is not 
resistance but submission; and if it had been intended that every 
manifestation of force, however slight, against the authorities and 
their agents should bring the case under article 249, it was an idle 
waste of words to make other provisions to cover grave resistance and 
simple resistance. It therefore seems reasonable to hold that the words 
in article 249 relating to the employment of force are in some degree 
limited by the connection in which they are used and are less peremptory
 than they at first seem. Reasonably interpreted they appear to have 
reference to something more dangerous to civil society than a simple 
blow with the hands at the moment a party is taken into custody by a 
policeman.

 In this case, it was established that petitioner grabbed the shirt
 of PO2 Navarro, then slapped and kicked him several times. PO2 Navarro 
testified: 
  


 Q: When you [saw] these (sic) commotion, what did you and Police officer Merza do? 

    A: We tried to stop them and introduced ourselves as police officers, sir.


 Q: Who directed them to stop, and did they stop? 

    A; Yes, sir. 


Q: What did you do next? 

    A We invited them at the police station, so that they will file their complaint if there is any. 


 Q: Did they abide on (
sic
) you? 

    A: No, sir. 


 Q: And what did they do?
 
    A: After telling them to go to the police station, there was one (1)
 woman who shouted: 'WALA KAYO PAKIALAM SA AKIN. HINDI AKO SASAMA SA 
INYO."


 Q: Was the woman who shouted part of the group? 

    A: Yes, sir. 


Q: What did you do then after you heard those words? 

    A: We continued telling them to board on the vehicle, but this woman slapped me and kicked me, sir. 


. . . . 


Q: You said that this woman held your collar, and slapped and kicked you. How many times [were] you slapped? 

    A: I could not remember, sir. 


Q: Where were [you] slapped?
 
    A: On my right cheek, sir. 


Q: And where were you kicked?
 
    A: On both legs, sir. 


Q: How many times were you kicked? 

    A: Many times, sir.
[56]
 




 In the January 12, 2007 Joint Affidavit of PO3 Merza and PO2 Navarro, they stated: 
  


 That upon arrival thereat we saw a two group of female persons 
fighting each other in front of gen-ex Billiard hall, located along 
Gordon Avenue, New Asinan Olongapo City, That we immediately pacified 
them, introduced ourselves as a Police officers (
sic
) despite we 
wearing our official Police uniform and invited both parties involved to
 our station for proper disposition, but one of the person (
sic
) 
involved later identified as Jona (sic) Mallari Y Samar who reeking with
 the smell of alcoholic beverages resisted and shows disrespect and 
disobedience upon us, and uttered the following remarks on top of her 
voice "WALA KAYO PAKIALAM SA AKIN HINDI AKO SASAMA SA INYO!" then she 
grabbed PO2 Navarro (
sic
) uniform and repeatedly kicked him and slapped him on his face that cause (
sic
) an injury to his person, and placed us to an embarrassing situation; 


 That we compelled to used (
sic
) a necessary and sufficient forced (
sic
) to arrest him and brought (
sic
) to our Station for proper disposition[.]
[57]




 Mallari also admitted to this. Her testimony reveals: 
  


 Q: Ms. Witness, in your complaint affidavit [and] ear[l]ier you 
mentioned that PO2 Navarro was in uniform, and he was inviting you to go
 to the police station, and in 2.4 paragraph of your complaint affidavit
 Ms. Witness, on the last portion of the paragraph you mentioned "I was 
afraid he might again harm me, so I grabbed his shirt to push him away 
and kick him away." Now, you admit having grabbed the shirt of police 
officer Navarro? 

    A: Yes, Ma'[a]m.


 Q: You admit having kicked him? 

    A: Yes, ma'am. 


 Q: I will let you read the part, "when I get up, PO2 Navarro 
approached me." So he was not doing anything but approaching you, 
correct?
 
    A: Yes, Ma'[a]m.


 Q: And upon getting near you Ms. Witness you grabbed his shirt and kicked him? 

    A: Yes, Ma'[a]m.
[58]
 




Based on the circumstances, petitioner's resistance and use of 
force are not so serious to be deemed as direct assault. While she 
exerted force, it is not dangerous, grave, or severe enough to warrant 
the penalties attached to the crime. 
  
 Moreover, PO2 Navarro himself stated that he was not kicked hard: 
  


 Q: Were you kicked hard by the accused? 

    A: Not really hard, sir.


 Court: Did you resent being kicked in the presence of other ladies? 

    A: Yes, Your Honor.
[59]




 Thus, instead of direct assault, this Court convicts petitioner of resistance or disobedience. 

 When the crime proved is different from the offense alleged, the  
accused may be convicted of the offense proved when the offense charged 
necessarily includes the offense proven.
[60]
 Rule 120, Sections 4 and 5 of the Rules of Court provide: 
  


 SECTION 4. 
Judgment in case of variance between allegation and proof
.
 â When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint 
or information and that proved, and the offense as charged is included 
in or necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused shall be 
convicted of the offense proved which is included in the offense 
charged, or of the offense charged which is included in the offense 
proved. 


 SECTION 5. 
When an offense includes or is included in another.

 â An offense charged necessarily includes the offense proved when some 
of the essential elements or ingredients of the former, as alleged in 
the complaint or information, constitute the latter. And an offense 
charged is necessarily included in the offense proved, when the 
essential ingredients of the former constitute or form part of those 
constituting the latter. 




 In this case, although the charge is direct assault, the 
prosecution was able to prove resistance or disobedience. These offenses
 have similar elements, varying only as to the degree of seriousness of 
the offender's resistance. Direct assault necessarily includes 
resistance or disobedience.
