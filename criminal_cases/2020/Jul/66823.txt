Amurao and Valencia pleaded "not guilty" to all charges.
The prosecution and defense's contrasting versions of the events, as summarized by the CA, are as follows:
Version of the Prosecution
The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the prosecution's version of facts as follows:
Sometime in February 2013, the National Bureau of Investigation - Central Luzon Regional Office (NB1CELRO) received a report from the International Justice Mission (IJM), a non-governmental organization involved in anti-trafficking in person project, that appellant Esmeraldo T. Amurao was involved in prostituting women in Balibago, Angeles City, Pampanga, some of whom are minors.
On February 19, 2013 at around 8:30 in the evening, two NBI agents went to Fields Avenue in Angeles City to verify the report. As poseur customers, they went to Natalia Hotel where they met hotel security guard Jeffrey Papauran, who called on appellant Esmeraldo Amurao, who was selling cigarette and Viagra in the area. The NBI agents talked to appellant and inquired from him regarding the minor girls he was selling to customers. Appellant told the NBI agents that he could provide them with girls at P1,500.00 each. The agents then asked appellant to provide them with six (6) girls the following night.
Thereafter, the NBI agents returned to their office and informed their superior about the result of their operation. Special Investigator (SI) III Henry C. Roxas, Jr. organized a team for a possible rescue and entrapment operations. The team also coordinated with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Region III and requested them to form part of the support group. Since the NBI failed to secure an arrest warrant for appellant, they decided to proceed with the entrapment operation and prepared the entrapment money worth P9,000.00 which were all in P1,000.00 denomination.
In the evening of February 20, 2013, SI Henry Roxas and another NBI agent returned to Natalia Hotel in Fields Avenue, Angeles City. When they arrived at the area, appellant offered them some girls but they insisted that they be given minor girls.
Minutes later, appellant, together with co-accused Marlyn D. Valencia, arrived with six minor girls in tow. Realizing that the girls brought by appellant and accused Marlyn D. Valencia were indeed minors, the undercover NBI agents requested the girls to go inside their van. Accused Valencia also boarded the van as she was acting as their "
mamasan
" as she was chaperoning the girls.
SI Henry Roxas then handed to appellant the marked money worth P9,000.00, and the latter deducted P1,000.00 from the amount as his commission. Appellant gave the rest of the money to BBB, who was acting as the leader of the girls.
Once the girls were all inside the van, SI Henry Roxas signaled the rest of the team through a missed call and proceeded with the rescue operation. Appellant was subsequently arrested and the marked money was recovered from him and BBB.
After the operation, the team brought the six (6) girls to the DSWD Region III Office, while appellant and accused Marlyn D. Valencia were brought to NBI-CELRO for fingerprinting and photograph taking. At the DSWD, the girls executed sworn statements narrating the circumstances that transpired prior to their rescue, particularly the fact that appellant and accused Marlyn D. Valencia recruited and promised them P1,500.00 in exchange for sex with a customer, They likewise declared that they were still minors at the time of their rescue.
Appellant and accused Marlyn D. Valencia were subjected to Inquest Proceedings on February 22, 2013. in its Resolution of even date, Prosecutor Modesto A. Cendana found probable cause and recommended the filing of several Information for Violation of RA 9208 and RA 7610, respectively.
Version of the defense
On 19 February 2013, accused-appellant was in front of Natalia Hotel vending cigarettes and viagra. The security guard of Natalia Hotel introduced the NBI agents to him. Accused-appellant claims that the agents gave him P500.00 to look for girls, but, when he failed to provide the girls, the agents still gave him a tip of P500.00 since the said agents won in the casino.
On 20 February 2013, accused-appellant passed by Natalia Hotel and saw the agents again. The said agents asked him to look for girls and even told him "huwag mo naman kami ipahiya." Since the agents promised to give him a tip, he took his chance to look for six girls. Accused-appellant then contacted his co-accused Marlyn to look for girls. Later on, they were able to bring only four girls to the agents. While in front of Natalia Hotel, two other girls passed by and w[ere] invited by one of the girls they brought to the agents. When they introduced the girls to the agents, the girls and Marlyn boarded the van of the agents. The agents handed P9,000.00 to accused-appellant who took P1,000.00 as his tip and handed the remaining P8,000.00 to the girls. Thereafter, the agents declared that they were NBI agents and immediately arrested accused-appellant.

Thus, herein Amurao was convicted of Trafficking in Persons in Criminal Case No. 13-9736 in connection with the trafficking of AAA who was already of majority age at the time of the commission of the offense. Amurao was held guilty of Qualified Trafficking in Persons in Criminal Cases Nos. 13-9737 and 13-9738 in connection with the trafficking of minors BBB and CCC.
Amurao was acquitted in Criminal Cases Nos. 13-9739 and 13-9740 involving private complainants DDD and EEE. Criminal Cases Nos. 13-9741, 13-9742, 13-9743, and 13-9744 (involving private complainants CCC, EEE, DDD, and BBB, respectively) were dismissed on the ground of double-jeopardy.
Hence, Amurao appealed his conviction in Criminal Cases Nos. 13-9736, 13-9737, and 13-9738 on November 29, 2013.
[17]
 In his Memorandum of Appeal to the CA, Amurao interposed the defense of instigation. He also argued that he should have been convicted only of White Slave Trade under Article 341 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).
[18]
 Co-accused Valencia did not appeal her conviction.
The CA Decision
In its Decision dated December 21, 2015, the CA affirmed the RTC Decision, with modification only as to the award of damages. The CA did not give any credence to Amurao's defenses. On the defense of instigation, the CA held that there was no indication that Amurao was merely induced to commit the crime. On the contrary, the testimonies of the witnesses proved that Amurao was already engaged in the illicit business of recruiting women into prostitution. The NBI agents merely devised a scheme to facilitate Amurao's apprehension through the entrapment operation.
With regard to the classification of the offense, the CA affirmed Amurao's conviction and held that all the elements of Trafficking in Persons and Qualified Trafficking in Persons were present as it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that Amurao recruited women, some of whom were minors, to be trafficked into prostitution.
The CA added the award of moral damages of P500,000.00 and exemplary damages of P100,00.00, each for AAA, BBB, and CCC and deleted the award of nominal damages. The CA also imposed interest at 6% 
per annum
 on the award from finality of judgment until full payment. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:
WHEREFORE
, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City, Branch 59, in Criminal Case Nos. 13-9736, 13-9737 and 139738 are hereby 
AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
 in that accused-appellant is 
ORDERED
 to pay the respective victims moral damages in the amount of P5 00,000.00 and exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00. The award of nominal damages are hereby 
DELETED
. Also, interests at the rate of 6% 
per annum
 shall be imposed on all the damages awarded from the time judgment had become final until fully paid. The appealed decision is hereby 
AFFIRMED 
in all respects.
SO ORDERED
.
[19]
Thus, this appeal.
Issue
Whether the guilt of Amurao was proven beyond reasonable doubt.
The Court's Ruling
The appeal has no merit.
Upon judicious review of the records of the case, the Court affirms the factual findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA. The Court upholds the findings of the courts 
a quo
 that Amurao's guilt for the offense of Trafficking in Persons against AAA and Qualified Trafficking in Persons against minors BBB and CCC for the purpose of prostitution was proven beyond reasonable doubt.
Factual findings of the trial court, including its assessment of the credibility of witnesses, probative weight of their testimonies, as well as of the documentary evidence, are accorded great weight and respect, especially when the same are affirmed by the CA, as in this case.
[20]
Trafficking in Persons and Prostitution are defined under Section 3 of RA 9208:
SEC. 3. 
Definition of Terms
. - As used in this Act:
(a) 
Trafficking in Persons
 - refers to the recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the persons, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.
The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as "trafficking in persons" even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph.
x x x x
(c) 
Prostitution
 - refers to any act, transaction, scheme or design involving the use of a person by another, for sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct in exchange for money, profit or any other consideration.
Amurao was convicted for violation of both simple Trafficking in Persons under Section 4(a) and Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4(a) in relation to Section 6(a) of the law:
SEC. 4. 
Acts of Trafficking in Persons
. - It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:
(a) To 
recruit
, transport, transfer, harbor, 
provide
, or receive 
a person
 by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, 
for the purpose of prostitution
, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage[.] (Emphasis supplied)
Under Section 6(a) of RA 9208, the crime is qualified when the trafficked person is a child, which is defined as a person below the age of 18 years old or above 18 years old but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition.
[21]
In
 People v. Casio
,
[22]
 the Court defined the elements of Trafficking in Persons, as follows:
(1) The 
act 
of "recruitment, transportation, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders";
(2) The 
means 
used which include "threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another"; and
(3)  The 
purpose 
of  trafficking   is   exploitation   which   includes "exploitation  or  the  prostitution  of others  or  other  forms  of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs."
[23]
In the instant case, the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of the offense of simple Trafficking in Persons and Qualified Trafficking in Persons. The testimonies of AAA, BBB, and CCC were direct,  straightforward,  and  consistent.  They  all  similarly testified that
Amurao recruited them for the purpose of prostitution on the night of February 20, 2013.
[24]
 The minority of BBB and CCC were duly proven by their Birth Certificates.
[25]
The testimonies of AAA, BBB, and CCC also corroborated the testimony of the arresting officer from the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Special Investigator III (SI) Henry Roxas, who detailed the conduct of the entrapment operation which led to the arrest of Amurao and Valencia.
Amurao himself corroborated the testimony of the prosecution witnesses. He admitted that on February 19, 2013, he was at the Natalia Hotel where he met two NBI agents acting as poseur-buyers who inquired about minor girls. Amurao likewise did not deny that he brought the female victims to Natalia Hotel on February 20, 2013 for the purpose of prostituting them. Amurao merely interposed the defense of instigation, alleging that he was forced by the NBI agents to commit the crime.
Such defense deserves scant consideration. The use of entrapment by law enforcement officers as a means to arrest wrongdoers is an accepted practice. In 
People v. Hirang
,
[26]
 the accused similarly interposed the defense of instigation in the offense of Trafficking against Persons. The Court rejected his defense and held:
Instigation is the means by which the accused is lured into the commission of the offense charged in order to prosecute him. On the other hand, entrapment is the employment of such ways and means for the purpose of trapping or capturing a lawbreaker. Thus, in instigation, officers of the law or their agents incite, induce, instigate or lure an accused into committing an offense which he or she would otherwise not commit and has no intention of committing. But in entrapment, the criminal intent or design to commit the offense charged originates in the mind of the accused, and law enforcement officials merely facilitate the apprehension of the criminal by employing ruses and schemes; thus, the accused cannot justify his or her conduct. In instigation, where law enforcers act as co-principals, the accused will have to be acquitted. But entrapment cannot bar prosecution and conviction. As has been said, instigation is a "trap for the unwary innocent" while entrapment is a "trap for the unwary criminal."
[27]
As correctly held by the CA, it was established that Amurao is a known pimp who recruits women into prostitution, as testified to by AAA:

Thus, the testimony of AAA and CCC confirmed that Amurao had already been involved in the illegal trafficking of women even prior to the entrapment operation and arrest on February 20, 2013.
Moreover, there is no indication that Amurao was merely forced or induced to commit the crime. His defense is belied by his own actions in readily agreeing to procure girls for the NBI agents/poseur-buyers and in his active recruitment of the victims. Thus, Amurao's defense of instigation has no merit. Acting on the report from the International Justice Mission, the NBI agents conducted a valid entrapment. They merely devised a scheme to facilitate Amurao's illegal activities in order to arrest him.
Given the foregoing, the Court affirms Amurao's conviction for one count of simple Trafficking in Persons as defined under Section 4(a) of RA 9208 in Criminal Case No. 13-9736 in connection with the trafficking of AAA. Amurao's convictions for two separate counts of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4(a) in relation to Section 6(a) of RA 9208, in Criminal Cases Nos. 13-9737 and 13-9738 involving minor victims BBB and CCC are also affirmed.
The penalties imposed by the RTC and affirmed by the CA are likewise upheld. Section 10 of RA 9208 provides:
SEC. 10. 
Penalties and Sanctions
. - The following penalties and sanctions are hereby established for the offenses enumerated in this Act:
(a) Any person found guilty of committing any of the acts enumerated in Section 4 shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twenty (20) years and a fine of not less than One million pesos (P1,000,000.00) but not more than Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00);
x x x x
(c) Any person found guilty of qualified trafficking under Section 6 shall suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) but not more than Five million pesos (P5,000,000.00)[.]
Hence, the penalty imposed on Amurao in Criminal Case No. 13-9736 of imprisonment of twenty (20) years and a fine of One million pesos (P1,000,000.00); and life imprisonment and a fine of Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) in Criminal Cases Nos. 13-9737 and 13-9738, respectively, are correct.
Anent the award of damages, the CA correctly modified the nature and amount of the damages in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence. In 
People v. Lalli
,
[30]
 the Court held that the award moral and exemplary damages was warranted in cases of Trafficking in Persons as a prostitute under the Civil Code,
[31]
 as the offense is analogous to the crimes of seduction, abduction, rape or other lascivious acts. Following 
Lalli
, the CA correctly awarded moral damages of P500,000.00 and exemplary damages of P100,000.00 each to AAA, BBB and CCC. The CA's imposition of six percent (6%) interest 
per annum
 on the award from finality of judgment until full payment was likewise appropriate in line with the Court's ruling in 
Nacar v. Gallery Frames
