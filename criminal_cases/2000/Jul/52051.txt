 WELFARE AND DEVELOPMENT

 Field Office Director
 DSWD-Field Office VI

In a Resolution
[4]
 dated February 8, 2000, the Court directed the Office of the Solicitor General to Comment on the final report submitted by the DSWD.
In compliance with the said resolution, the Solicitor General's office filed its Comment on March 14, 2000 stating that it interposes no objection to the recommendation of the DSWD.
In the said Final Report, the DSWD claims that as a result of its team's rehabilitation efforts, accused-youthful offender Gerry Legarda has allegedly behaved properly and has shown his capability to be a useful member of the community. Attached to that Final Report are (a) the updated Social Case Study Report re: Jerry Legarda;
[5]
 (b) the four (4) copies of Progress Reports submitted by the RRCY Senior Social Worker and noted by RRCY Head Social Worker;
[6]
 (c) the original copy of the Assessment Report dated February 4, 1998 regarding the willingness and capability of Mr. Emilio Legarda to take care of his son, Gerry Legarda upon discharge into his custody;
[7]
 and (d) the copy of Court Order for the commitment of Gerry Legarda to the Department of Social Welfare and Development which was issued by Judge Salvador Gubaton, RTC Branch 14, Roxas City dated March 6, 1996.
[8]
It is our view that, under the circumstances, the said Final Report and recommendation of the DSWD should be referred to the Regional Trial Court of Roxas City for its appropriate action and disposition in line with our Decision in the case of 
People v. Ricky Galit, et al.,
[9]
 
the pertinent portions of which read, to wit:
"The offense charged in this case, Robbery with Homicide, is punishable by 
reclusion perpetua to death 
(Art. 294(1), R.P.C.). As a matter of fact, the herein appellants were sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua. 
Consequently, the suspension of sentence as provided under Art. 192 of P.D. 603, as amended, does not apply to accused Raquel Tagalog and Ricky Galit.
Nonetheless, considering that the decision against accused Ricky Galit and Raquel Tagalog had become final, this Court can no longer alter the judgment rendered by the trial court however erroneous it may have been. This Court has no jurisdiction to pass judgment on an accused who did not appeal the sentence of conviction imposed by the trial court (People v. Medrano, 122 SCRA 586 [1983]).
This brings us to the manifestation dated April 17, 1993 filed by counsel for accused Ricky Galit praying for his release from the National Training School for Boys (NTSB) as recommended in the Final Report submitted by the Senior Officer of the NTSB on the ground that Ricky Galit had complied with the conditions of his rehabilitation.
In his Comment dated October 15, 1993, the Solicitor General interposed no objection to the final release of Ricky Galit from the custody of the NTSB, DSWD, Tanay, Rizal, provided accused Galit's civil liability is not extinguished as provided in Articles 198 and 201 of the Child and Youth Welfare Code.
Be that as it may, it is not the responsibility of this Court to order the release of accused Ricky Galit without the benefit of a review of the recommendation of the Department of Social Welfare by the trial court. Art. 196 of PD 603 provides:
"Art. 196. 
Dismissal of the case. -
 If it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the youthful offender whose sentence has been suspended, has behaved properly and has shown his capability to be a useful member of the community, even before reaching the age of majority, upon recommendation of the Department of Social Welfare, it shall dismiss the case and order his final discharge."
It is therefore clear that in cases where the DSWD recommends the discharge of a youthful offender, it is the trial court before whom the report and recommendation is subject to judicial review. Recommendation alone is not sufficient to warrant the release of a youthful offender. In reviewing the DSWD's recommendation, the trial judge must not base his judgment on mere conclusions but should seek out concrete, material and relevant facts to confirm that the youthful offender has indeed been reformed and is ready to re-enter society as a productive and law-abiding citizen.
Caution, however, is given to the trial court. To begin with, the youthful offender is not to be tried anew for the same act for which he was charged. The inquiry is not a criminal prosecution but is rather limited to the determination of the offender's proper education and rehabilitation during his commitment in the Training Center and his moral and social fitness to re-join the community."
WHEREFORE,
 in view of the favorable recommendation of the Field Office Director, Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Field Office VI, Molo, Iloilo City, the court a quo is hereby directed to review the same and to pronounce judgment thereon as it may deem proper under the circumstances without prejudice to any civil liabilities of accused-youthful offender Gerry Legarda may have incurred by reason of his conviction.
Let a copy of the said Final Report dated November 3, 1999 of the DSWD-Field Office VI, Molo, Iloilo City, together with its annexes, be forwarded to the Regional Trial Court of Roxas City, Branch 14, for that purpose.
SO ORDERED.
