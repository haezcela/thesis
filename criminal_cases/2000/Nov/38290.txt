VITUG, J.:


Vengeance is never legally justified; even the most unfortunate loss of a life cannot be requited for its sake by the taking of another life.
In an Information, dated 12 October 1994, Segundo Alverio, Jr., Jose Juanites and John Doe were charged with the crime of Murder; thus:
"That on or about the 22nd day of July 1994, in the Municipality of Caibiran, Biliran Province, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused, conspiring with, confederating and mutually helping one another and with great abuse of superior strength, with intent to kill, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab one Santos Cabillan, Jr. with a short bladed weapon which the accused have provided themselves for the purpose, thereby inflicting upon the said Santos Cabillan, Jr. multiple mortal wounds which caused his death shortly thereafter.
"In violation of Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code."
[1]
Only accused Alverio was apprehended; he pled "not guilty" to the charge.  Trial immediately followed the arraignment.
The court 
a quo
 narrated the conflicting versions of the prosecution and the defense.
Prosecution witness Bianito Solayao declared that on 22 July 1994, about one o'clock in the morning, while he, together with Victorio ("Nicnic") Cabalquinto and the deceased Santos Cabillan, Jr., were on their way home after watching a "Miss Gay" presentation in front of the Municipal Building of Caibiran, Biliran, they were met by three persons.  One of the trio immediately went behind and collared Cabillan and then proceeded to stab him with a knife. The two other companions of the attacker thereupon positioned themselves in front of the victim and forthwith likewise stabbed him.  Solayao tried to call for help while Cabalquinto fled.  The three malefactors later escaped towards Palanay.  Solayao immediately went back to check if Cabillan was still alive.  He was able to recognize the three attackers not only because of the light coming from an electric post but also because of the bright moonlight.  He identified accused Alverio as the person who collared Cabillan and stabbed the victim from behind.  The other prosecution eyewitness, Victorio Cabalquinto, corroborated the testimony of Solayao in its material points.
Police investigator SPO3 Leodegario Torlao testified that on 22 July 1994, around 1:20 a.m., he responded to a request for assistance made by Victor Cabillan.  He brought the cadaver of the victim to the medicare clinic for autopsy.  He found at the crime scene a hat, a slipper and a hunting knife.  SPO1 Michael Docallos brought the witnesses to the house of accused Alverio who, after being positively identified, was arrested.  Juanites was able to escape.  Torlao recalled that the victim was a suspect in the killing of one Romeo Alverio.
Dr. Zelda Trinidad Nicdao, who conducted the 
post mortem 
examination, stated that the victim had sustained thirty-eight (38) wounds consisting of seven (7) stab wounds, twenty-two (22) incised wounds, three (3) abrasions, three (3) cofluent abrasions, two (2) lacerated wounds and one (1) multiple linear abrasion caused by more than just one (1) sharp pointed instrument.
The family of the victim incurred for the embalming, funeral and burial expenses the sum of P20,000.00.
Accused Segundo Alverio, Jr., proffered an 
alibi
, contending that at the time of the incident on 22 July 1994 he was at his house in Barangay Maurang caring for his sick child.  Alverio stayed home until seven o'clock in the morning as he had to report for work in Caibiran, Biliran, splitting bamboos for the school fence. Two hours later, police officers Michael Docallos and Romeo Vinos, together with two other persons, arrived at the school premises.  After observing him for about half an hour, Docallos, putting an arm around Alverio, invited the latter to the police station.  Asked why, the policemen told him to wait until they would have been in the police station.  Lilibeth Martinez, who was present, asked if the policemen had a warrant for Alverio's arrest; they had none to show.  At the police station, the accused claimed, he was manhandled.
Corroborating Alverio, Roberto Diaz, a friend of the accused, stated that he stayed in the house of the accused until 5:00 in the morning of 22 July 1994 tending to the sick son of the accused.  Lilibeth Martinez, a school teacher of Barangay Maurang, confirmed that Alverio was working on the school fence when he was fetched by the policemen and that when she asked the policemen whether the latter had a warrant of arrest, they replied in the negative.
After trial, the Regional Trial Court of Naval, Biliran, Branch 16, in its decision, dated 19 May 1998 (promulgated on 22 July 1998), convicted accused Segundo Alverio, Jr.
"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered finding accused Segundo Alverio, Jr. GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder which is punished under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code with Reclusion Temporal Maximum to Death and there being no mitigating or generic circumstance for or against the accused, the penalty shall be imposed in its medium period.  Accused Segundo Alverio, Jr. is, therefore, sentenced to suffer the prison term of RECLUSION PERPETUA and ordered to indemnify the heirs of Santos Cabillan, Jr. the sum of P50,000.00; to pay P20,000.00 for actual damages; to pay P10,000.00 for moral damages and to pay the costs."
[2]
The trial court found adequate proof to qualify the crime to murder after considering the number of wounds sustained by the victim and the suddenness of the attack made by the three armed malefactors.
The convicted accused, through counsel, timely filing a notice of appeal, would now contend that -
"1. THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT WITNESSES SOLAYAO AND CABALQUINTO POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED ACCUSED ALVERIO INSPITE OF THE TESTIMONY OF POLICE OFFICER TORLAO THAT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME WAS VERY DARK.
"2. THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY INSPITE OF THE SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE IDENTIFICATION AND ARREST OF ACCUSED ALVERIO.
"3. THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED FOR MURDER INSPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT CLEARLY SHOWN THAT THERE WAS DELIBERATE INTENT ON THE PART OF THE ACCUSED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR SUPERIOR STRENGTH."
[3]
The Court finds no valid reasons to reverse the judgment of the trial court.  The real focus on the appeal relates to an evaluation on the credibility of the witnesses presented by the prosecution and the defense at the trial.  The findings on this score by the trial court are accorded great weight and respect.
[4]
 The assessment on the testimony of witnesses is a matter best undertaken by the trial court
[5]
 because of its opportunity, first hand, to observe the declarants at the witness stand and to determine the veracity of their statements.
[6]
The Court, nevertheless, has closely examined the records.  The denial and 
alibi
 posed by the defense are just too unconvincing to overcome the narration, given in great detail, by the eyewitnesses.  Observe the straightforward testimony of Bianito Solayao:

[8]
There simply is no way that the 
alibi
 of accused-appellant and his denial can hold against the positive declaration of the eyewitnesses.  
Alibi 
is inherently a weak defense for it can easily be fabricated;
[9]
 for it to be appreciated, it is necessary not only to prove the presence of the accused at another place at the time of the perpetration of the offense but also that it is physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene.
[10]
 It is hardly so in this case.  Neither can denial, like 
alibi
, prevail over the positive testimony given by eyewitnesses.
[11]
The Court sustains the trial court in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength in the killing of the victim.  While mere superiority in number does not 
per se
 indicate the presence of this circumstance,
[12]
 it may be properly considered, however, when, like here, the assailants likewise enjoy and make use of their superiority in arms.
[13]
 The assailants in this case, two of whom are yet to be brought to justice, have clearly overwhelmed the victim rendering him completely unable to defend himself.
WHEREFORE
, the assailed decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED 
in toto
.  Costs against accused-appellant.
SO ORDERED.
