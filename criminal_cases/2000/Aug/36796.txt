YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:


This is an appeal from the decision dated June 19, 1997 of the 
Regional Trial Court, Branch 2 of Iligan City in Criminal Case No. 5923,
 the dispositive portion of which reads:



WHEREFORE, and in view of the foregoing considerations, judgment is
 hereby rendered finding all the accuseds (sic) namely: Leo Macaliag, 
Jesse Torre, a.k.a. âSasotâ and Juliver Chua, a.k.a. âBotyokâ, guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt as principals of the crime of murder as the same
 is defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, 
sentencing each and every accused to suffer the penalty of reclusion 
perpetua with all the accessory penalties provided for under the law as 
well as to pay the cost.  They are furthermore ordered to pay the heirs 
of the deceased, jointly and severally, the sum of P50,000.00 as and for
 the death of deceased Brian Jalani and further the sum of P20,000.00 as
 and for moral damages. 


SO ORDERED.
[1]






This case originated from the information filed against 
accused-appellants Jesse Torre, a.k.a. âSasotâ and Juliver Chua, a.k.a. 
âBotyokâ, along with co-accused Leo Macaliag which alleged:



That on or about April 16, 1995, in the City of Iligan, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
said accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping
 each other, armed with a deadly weapon, by means of treachery and 
evident premeditation, and with intent to kill, did then and there 
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, stab and wound one
 Brian Jalani, thereby inflicting upon him the following physical 
injuries, to wit:
  




- Cardio Respiratory Arrest
        

        - Hypovolemic Shock, R shoulder
        
   
        R Infrascapular area, L Lumbar
        
    
        all penetrating
    




which caused his death.
  


Contrary to and in violation of Article 248 of the Revised Penal 
Code with the aggravating circumstances of treachery and evident 
premeditation.
[2]






The prosecution relied, for the most part, on the testimony of 
eyewitness Anacleto Moste who related in open court the relevant 
incidents of that fateful night of April 16, 1995.  According to him, he
 was then watching a political rally at Purok Rosal, Villaverde, Iligan 
City on or about 9:30 oâclock in the evening when he heard a certain 
David, who was in a state of panic, asking for help because someone was 
being stabbed near Baslayan Creek, not too distant from where the rally 
was taking place.  When he arrived at the scene, he saw three (3) men 
attacking a lone victim.  He was able to recognize the three (3) accused
 as the perpetrators, as well as the hapless victim, one Brian Jalani, 
for they were all personally known to him.  There was adequate lighting 
coming from a nearby lamp post, and witness Moste was only a mere eight 
(8) to ten (10) meters away from them.  Furthermore, there were no 
obstructions to his line of vision.  In describing the positions of the 
accused relative to the victim, witness Moste testified that accused 
Torre was holding the neck of victim Jalani from the latterâs back, 
while the other two accused, Chua and Macaliag, were to the victimâs 
right and left, taking turns in stabbing him.  He shouted at the 
perpetrators three (3) times before accused Torre pushed the victim into
 the creek, after which all the three (3) accused fled towards the 
direction of Purok Gumamela.  Moste was about to chase them, but decided
 against it when he heard the cries of the victim who was sinking into 
the mud and gasping for breath, at the same time bleeding profusely from
 his stab wounds.  Moste tried to solicit the aid of some onlookers, 
shouting for help, as he himself started to drown in the mud while 
striving to keep victim Jalani from sinking.  Finally, three workers 
from Dado Lechon took pity and pulled Moste and Jalani out of the muddy 
creek.

After some difficulty in securing a vehicle, the victim was 
finally brought to the Dr. Uy Hospital for treatment, but he (Jalani) 
succumbed to death shortly thereafter.  By then, witness Moste had 
already left the hospital to notify Jalaniâs mother and to report the 
incident to one SPO4 Lubang, who happened to be Mosteâs neighbor.
[3]


The prosecution also presented Dr. Livey Villarin to identify the
 necropsy report.  The doctor testified that the victim sustained six 
(6) stab wounds in all:  three (3) in front and three (3) at his back; 
the most fatal of which was the one on the victimâs chest.
[4]


The final witness for the prosecution was SPO4 Antonio Lubang who
 was, at the time of the incident, the Assistant Chief of the Special 
Investigating Unit of Precinct 4 of the Iligan City Police Command.  He 
testified that at 1:00 oâclock in the early morning of April 17, 1995, 
he was awakened by witness Moste and a certain Rene Alasagas who 
reported the stabbing incident involving the victim Brian Jalani and the
 three accused.  He further averred that upon investigation, other 
witnesses positively identified Macaliag as one of the perpetrators.  He
 was also able to interview one Jeffrey Yorong who stated that had he 
not been able to escape, he would have been the first victim of the same
 perpetrators that night.
[5]


There were no immediate arrests since all three accused had fled 
the vicinity.  It was only on February 1, 1996 or almost ten (10) months
 later that accused Juliver Chua was apprehended.  The other two 
accused, Leo Macaliag and Jesse Torre, were brought under the 
jurisdiction of the trial court some four (4) months thereafter.  Upon 
their arraignment, all three accused pleaded not guilty, interposing the
 defense of alibi.

For his part, accused Juliver Chua argued that he could not have 
been in the vicinity of the crime because he was then dancing at a disco
 in Tambacan, Iligan City; that he only returned to Villaverde, Iligan 
City in the early hours of the morning of April 17, 1995; that he even 
met prosecution witness Moste along the way, where the latter allegedly 
asked him (Chua) if he knew the whereabouts of Leo Macaliag and Jesse 
Torre.

On cross-examination, accused Chua testified that on or about 
1:10 in the morning, on his way home from the disco, he met co-accused 
Leo Macaliag and Jesse Torre at Aldo Arts and Signs, both of whom 
persuaded him to accompany them to Purok Manuang, Mahayahay, Iligan 
City.  It was there where he first learned that Brian Jalani had been 
stabbed to death by Macaliag and Torre, allegedly with the participation
 of one Jun Tacastacas and Michael Pato, who were then having a drinking
 session.  He decided to go home because he was afraid that he would be 
implicated in whatever crime Macaliag and the others had committed.
[6]


Accused Chuaâs alibi was corroborated by his girlfriend, Carla 
Garces.  She testified that she was with Chua at the disco on the night 
of the incident and that they were together the whole time.  They left 
the disco together at about 1:00 oâclock in the morning, parting ways at
 the traffic light at Quezon Avenue.
[7]


Next to testify on Chuaâs behalf was his mother Antonia Chua, who
 related that at 10:00 oâclock in the evening of April 16, 1995, she 
went to the disco to fetch her son, but she left him in the company of 
his girlfriend Carla Garces who agreed to accompany him home.  The elder
 Chua further stated that her son arrived home at 1:30 oâclock in the 
morning of the following day.
[8]


On the part of accused Jesse Torre, his mother, Rosita Torre 
testified that at the time of the incident, Jesse was with her at their 
home, sleeping until the following morning because he had a fever.  
After he recovered from his illness, accused Torre left for Cagayan de 
Oro City, where he worked vending peanuts until he and co-accused Leo 
Macaliag were arrested in June of 1996.
[9]


Accused Jesse Torre reiterated that he was at home, sick with 
fever, on the night of the tragic incident.  He denied knowing the 
victim, Brian Jalani, while averring that he met co-accused Chua for the
 first time when both were already incarcerated in the city jail.  He 
also refuted earlier testimony that he and Macaliag were notoriously 
known as partners in crime, saying that they were mere acquaintances.  
And contrary to accused Chuaâs earlier allegation, Torre said he was not
 with the group of Macaliag, Tacastacas, Pato and Chua in Barrio 
Manuang, Mahayahay, Iligan City, in the early morning of April 17, 1995.
[10]


When it came time for accused Leo Macaliag to testify, he 
asserted that at the time of the incident, he was home drinking beer 
with his father.  He only learned of the incident when accused Chua came
 knocking and asked if he (Chua) could hide in the Macaliag house for a 
while.  He recalled that Chuaâs clothes were bloodied and covered with 
mud, prompting him to refuse Chuaâs request. Shortly thereafter, SPO4 
Antonio Lubang and prosecution witness Moste arrived, asking the 
whereabouts of Leo Macaliagâs younger brother, Roel, who was then 
attending the political rally.  He further averred that he stayed home 
for several weeks before moving to Cagayan de Oro City, where he also 
found a job selling peanuts until he was apprehended.
[11]


The last witness for the defense was one Estela Minister, a 
neighbor of accused Macaliag, who testified that at 11:00 oâclock in the
 evening of April 16, 1995, she was doing her laundry in front of her 
house.  She corroborated Macaliagâs testimony that accused Juliver Chua 
came to the Macaliag residence, but Chua was harangued by Leoâs mother 
who scolded him (Chua) and denied him entry.  That upon seeing Chuaâs 
dirty clothes and bloodied hands, she discontinued her washing, fearful 
that Chua would return.
[12]


After carefully evaluating all the conflicting testimonies and 
evidence adduced by the opposing parties, the Regional Trial Court 
rendered its decision finding all the accused guilty of the murder of 
Brian Jalani.

Not satisfied with the decision rendered by the trial court, 
accused Jesse Torre and Juliver Chua filed the instant appeal.  
Accused-appellants contend that â



I
  


THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE ALLEGED EYEWITNESS.
  


II
  


THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF 
THE CRIME OF MURDER DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THEIR 
GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT AND IN NOT CONSIDERING THE DEFENSE 
INTERPOSED BY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.
  


III
  


ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANTS INDEED KILLED THE VICTIM,
 THEN THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF 
MURDER INSTEAD OF THE LESSER OFFENSE OF HOMICIDE.
[13]






In support of the first and second assigned errors, the 
accused-appellants argued that while it is the rule that conclusions and
 findings of fact of the trial court are binding and are generally not 
disturbed on appeal, said rule is not without exception, such as when 
the trial court ignored and overlooked facts of such weight and 
influence which could alter the result if considered.
[14]

 The appellants submit that their case is an exception to the general 
rule, for the trial court overlooked and ignored the fact that the 
testimony of the alleged eyewitness Anacleto Moste was patently 
incredible and sadly lacking in truth, candor and spontaneity.
[15]


In particular, the accused-appellants found it hard to believe 
that Moste, knowing that the assailants were supposedly âpolice 
charactersâ, could summon the courage to shout at them, and even 
contemplate running after them.  To the accused-appellants, such a show 
of bravery runs counter to the ordinary course of human experience.  
Secondly, they pointed out that Mosteâs testimony did not agree with the
 medical findings that the victim sustained only six (6) stab wounds, 
which in their opinion was too few considering that some amount of time 
had elapsed since a certain David first witnessed the stabbing until 
Mosteâs arrival at the scene.  Furthermore, Mosteâs testimony that there
 were no policemen or bodyguards during the political rally at Purok 
Rosal is not to be believed since it is public knowledge that there are 
always bodyguards or police escorts protecting the candidates during 
rallies.

The accused-appellantsâ contentions are bereft of merit. The 
trial court based its judgment on the credible and overwhelming evidence
 presented by the prosecution.  Thus, we find no reason to disturb the 
conclusions or findings of fact of the trial court.  First, the bravery,
 or even heroism, of eyewitness Moste should not be belittled by the 
appellantsâ apparent lack of faith in the inherent goodness of human 
beings.  While it cannot be denied that not all men are heroes, neither 
are all men cowards.  Besides, what was in Mosteâs testimony that was 
unbelievable?  He admitted that his initial reaction was fear, but such 
fear did not paralyze him to inaction or apathy.  Instead, the better 
and more compassionate part of his being drove him to perform a civic, 
if not moral duty.  Eyewitness Moste is not a stranger to violence or 
civic duty.  He was once a member of the Philippine Constabulary 
assigned in Lanao del Sur
[16]
 and later with the PNP
[17]

 and as such, he must have witnessed countless violent acts while 
relying on inner courage to preserve the life and limb of others.  Given
 the circumstances as well as the character and experience of eyewitness
 Moste, we find nothing incredible in his reaction to the incident and 
his consequent testimony.  While witnessing a crime is an unusual 
experience which draws varying reactions from different people, it is 
well-established that there can be no clear cut standard form of 
behavior or response that can be expected.
[18]

  Fortunately for the prosecution, eyewitness Moste is possessed of 
better qualities than most men.  No amount of nonchalance or even 
condescension on the part of the accused-appellants can diminish 
eyewitness Mosteâs apparent selflessness, as well as credibility.

The fact that the victim sustained only six (6) stab wounds 
considering the amount of time that had elapsed is irrelevant to Mosteâs
 credibility as a witness.  The length of time that a crime takes to 
accomplish is never an indication of the number or severity of the 
wounds that the perpetrators can inflict on a victim.  It is sufficient 
that eyewitness Moste saw and recognized the appellants while they were 
engaged in the dastardly deed of stabbing the victim.  Besides, the 
victim also sustained abrasions apart from the multiple stab wounds, as 
testified to by the doctor who conducted the autopsy.
[19]

  It could even be concluded that said injury was sustained while the 
victim tried to fight off his assailants.  The victimâs resistance 
obviously slowed down the accused-appellants in the perpetration of 
their crime.  Be that as it may, this supposed inconsistency is too 
minor and insignificant to affect the credibility of Moste as a witness.
[20]


Besides, such a perceived inconsistency makes Mosteâs testimony 
even more credible.  The rule is well-settled that inconsistencies and 
contradictions which are minor, trivial and inconsequential cannot 
impair the credibility of the witness.  On the contrary, they only serve
 to strengthen the veracity of his categorical, straightforward and 
spontaneous testimony.
[21]


Consequently, it is of no moment that eyewitness Moste did not 
see any policemen or bodyguards of the candidates at the political 
rally.  This argument is too trivial to be entertained.  It has no 
bearing at all on the crime committed, and it is obvious that the 
accused-appellants are merely clutching at straws to bolster a very 
tenuous attack on the eyewitnessâ credibility.

Given the weakness of the accused-appellantâs arguments impugning
 the credibility of eyewitness Moste, the trial court did not err in 
giving full weight and credence to his testimony.  The factual findings 
of the trial court based on eyewitness Mosteâs testimony deserves the 
respect of this Court and must be accorded finality.
[22]

  In the absence of any indication that the trial court overlooked some 
material fact or gravely abused its discretion, we see no compelling 
reason to interfere with the trial courtâs assessment of the eyewitnessâ
 credibility.
[23]


In the second assigned error, accused-appellants contend that the
 prosecution failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  This 
contention is equally without merit. Even though Moste is the lone 
eyewitness to testify, his testimony is sufficient to convict the 
accused since his testimony bears the earmarks of truth and sincerity, 
spontaneously and naturally delivered in a straightforward manner.
[24]

  Besides, the accused-appellants never questioned eyewitness Mosteâs 
motives for testifying against them.  There was no indication that 
Mosteâs motives were improper, such that he would be driven to falsely 
testify against the accused-appellants under solemn oath.  It would run 
counter to the natural order of events and of human nature, and contrary
 to the presumption of good faith, for a prosecution witness to falsely 
testify if the accused is truly innocent.
[25]


Moreover, the lone testimony of eyewitness Moste, having been 
found credible and positive, is sufficient to convict the appellants for
 the truth is established not by quantity, but by the quality of his 
testimony.
[26]


Be that as it may, the accused-appellants argue that there was 
reasonable doubt because their defense of alibi was supported by candid 
and credible testimony.  While admitting that the defense of alibi is 
inherently weak, such defense was sufficiently proven by the 
accused-appellants and their witnesses.

The required elements for alibi to be appreciated are: (1) to 
prove the accusedâs presence at another place at the time of the 
perpetration of the crime; and (2) to demonstrate that it would thus be 
physically impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime.
[27]

  Accused-appellant Juliver Chua claimed that he was at a disco with his
 girlfriend at the time of the stabbing incident.  His corroborative 
witnesses were his girlfriend, Carla Garces, and his mother, Antonia 
Chua.  Accused-appellant Jesse Torre claimed that he was at home, sick 
with fever, a declaration which his mother, Rosita Torre, confirmed.  An
 examination of the accused-appellantsâ defense of alibi reveals the 
same to be self-serving and undeserving of any weight in law.  The 
appellants failed to present other witnesses to substantiate their 
alibi.  Thus, their alibi was not sufficiently proven in the absence of 
credible corroboration from disinterested witnesses.
[28]


It is a well-entrenched rule that when an accusedâs alibi can 
only be confirmed by his relatives and friends who may not be impartial 
witnesses, his denial of culpability of affirmative testimony merits 
scant consideration, especially in the face of affirmative testimony of 
an eyewitness as to the accusedâs presence in the crime scene.
[29]

 It has been uniformly held time and again that alibi and denial is 
worthless and cannot prevail over positive identification that is 
categorical, consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the 
part of the eyewitness.
[30]


Moreover, since the accused-appellantsâ alibi was established 
only by themselves, their relatives and friends, their denial of guilt 
should be treated with the strictest scrutiny.
[31]

 While they claimed that the accused-appellants were at another place at
 the time of the perpetration of the crime, they could not prove that it
 was physically impossible for the accused-appellants to be at the scene
 of the crime.  As found by the trial court, to wit:



There exists no physical impossibility in instances where it would 
take the accused only fifteen to twenty minutes by jeep or tricycle or 
some one and a half hours by foot to traverse the distance between the 
place where the accused allegedly was at the time of the commission and 
the scene of the crime.  Recently, the highest Court has ruled that 
there can be no physical impossibility even if the distances between the
 two places is merely two (2) hours by bus.  (People vs. Abuyan Jr., 
G.R. No. 95254-55, July 1992; People vs. Pidia, 249 SCRA 687).
  


The testimony of accused Juliver Chuaâs mother (Antonia Chua) and 
his sweetheart (Carla Garcia) are bereft of any proof that accused 
Juliver Chua could not have been at the scene of the crime on the said 
date at around 9:30 in the evening.
[32]






We note that when faced with the indubitable evidence of the 
prosecution, it became âevery man for himselfâ for the 
accused-appellants.  Juliver Chua testified that it was Macaliag and 
Torre who killed Jalani, while Macaliag countered by testifying that it 
was Chua who did the victim in.  As most guilty conspirators are prone 
to do, when caught between a rock and a hard place, they turn on each 
other in the vain hope that blame is shifted to someone else.  All these
 accusations and counter-accusations only tend to prove that they had 
personal knowledge of the crime.  It is clearly a desperate ploy to 
escape culpability.  It is not too difficult to see this tactic as a 
last-ditch attempt to pin the guilt on the other accused to bolster a 
sagging defense.  The courts are not easily swayed by such conflicting 
testimonies, especially when the obvious motive is to distort the truth 
and frustrate the ends of justice.

Finally, the accused-appellants assail the trial courtâs finding 
that the offense was committed with treachery as manifested by their 
taking advantage of their weapon and superiority in number.  The 
accused-appellants contend that the trial court should not have 
convicted them for murder considering that the lone eyewitness did not 
see how the fatal incident started.  

It is well-established that treachery, to be considered a 
qualifying circumstance, must be proven as clearly and indubitably as 
the crime itself,
[33]
 and it may not be simply deduced from presumption.
[34]

  In the instant case, the trial court based its conclusion that there 
was treachery on the mere fact that there were three perpetrators as 
against a lone victim, and that a bladed weapon was used to execute the 
crime.  The lower court, however, failed to consider that the lone 
eyewitness did not testify as to how the stabbing incident commenced, 
for indeed, said eyewitness would have no knowledge thereof.  He arrived
 at the scene some time after the stabbing started and thus, he could 
not testify as to whether or not there was provocation on the part of 
the victim.

This Court has uniformly ruled that treachery cannot qualify a 
killing to murder if the solitary eyewitness did not see the 
commencement of the assault.  In the absence of indubitable testimony on
 the manner in which the aggression was commenced, treachery cannot be 
reasonably appreciated as a qualifying circumstance.
[35]

  Thus, since the eyewitness failed to witness the initial attack 
inflicted on the victim, the qualifying circumstance of treachery cannot
 be applied.
[36]


In the recent case of 
People v. Cario
,
[37]
 this Court ruled that:



 âTreachery cannot be presumed, it must be proved by clear and 
convincing evidence or as conclusively as the killing itself.  Thus, 
where no particulars are shown as to the manner by which the aggression 
was commenced or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim 
began and developed, treachery can in no way be established from mere 
suppositions, drawn solely from circumstances prior to the killing. x x 
x.  The crime thus committed is only homicide, not murder as held by the
 trial court.â
  




And in the case of 
People v. Parras
,
[38]
 this Court had occasion to rule that:



 âTreachery must be proved by clear and convincing evidence, or as 
conclusively as the killing itself. x x x.  In this regard, the 
prosecution failed to definitively establish the manner in which the 
initial assault against the deceased victim was committed to justify the
 appreciation of treachery.  This hiatus in the prosecutionâs evidence 
cannot be substituted by mere suppositions as what the trial court 
apparently did.  It is a well-settled rule that in order to appreciate 
treachery as a modifying circumstance in a continuous aggression, as in 
this case, the same must be shown present at the inception of the 
attack.  Absent any showing therefor, treachery as a qualifying 
circumstance may not be considered.â
  




Consequently, the trial court erred in finding the accused-appellants
 guilty of the crime of murder and penalizing them under Article 248 of 
the Revised Penal Code.  Under the circumstances, they can only be 
convicted of the lesser crime of homicide under Article 249 of the 
Revised Penal Code. 

Nevertheless, it is clear that the crime was attended by the 
presence of an aggravating circumstance. It was committed with apparent 
abuse of superior strength.  The victim was clearly overwhelmed by the 
combined efforts of all three (3) accused who not only enjoyed 
superiority in number, but also of weapons.
[39]

 The records reveal that the defenseless victim was held back by accused
 Torre, while co-accused Chua and Macaliag took turns in stabbing him.  
There was obviously abuse of superior strength since all three (3) 
accused acted in concert to accomplish their felonious designs against 
the unarmed victim.  They purposely took advantage of their superior 
number and combined strength and force which was grossly out of 
proportion to whatever means of defense was available to their victim.
[40]


Meanwhile, the aggravating circumstance of nighttime cannot be 
considered since the records reveal that the scene of the crime was 
well-lighted by a fluorescent lamp.  Nocturnity does not become a 
modifying factor when the place is adequately lighted, and thus could no
 longer insure the offenderâs immunity from identification or capture.
[41]

 There being only one generic aggravating circumstance, the penalty 
imposed must be that prescribed by law, in its maximum period.
[42]


Based on all the foregoing, it is clear that the 
accused-appellants can only be found guilty of the crime of homicide and
 the appropriate penalty thereof is 
reclusion temporal
 in its 
maximum period.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, 
accused-appellants should be sentenced to suffer ten (10) years and one 
(1) day of 
prision mayor
, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
,
 as maximum.  The other co-accused, Leo Macaliag, who did not join the 
appellants in this appeal, shall also benefit from this judgment insofar
 as it is favorable and applicable to him.
[43]


WHEREFORE
, the appealed judgment of the Regional
 Trial Court is hereby MODIFIED.  Accused-appellants Juliver Chua and 
Jesse Torre, including co-accused Leo Macaliag, are found GUILTY of 
Homicide and sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of ten (10) 
years and one (1) day of 
prision mayor
, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
,
 as maximum, with all the accessory penalties provided by law.  In all 
other respects, the judgment of the trial court is AFFIRMED, with costs 
against said accused-appellants.

SO ORDERED.
