PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. MARIO MYRNO TAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. 

D E C I S I O N




QUISUMBING, J.:


On appeal is the decision rendered on January
 26, 1995, by the Regional 
Trial Court of Antipolo, Rizal, Branch 74, in Criminal Case No. 91-6398,
 finding appellant Mario Myrno Tan guilty of estafa under paragraph 2 
(d) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code and sentencing him to 

reclusion perpetua
.


In an Information dated January 11, 1991, Prosecutor Eduardo Fabian 
charged appellant with the crime of estafa allegedly committed as 
follows:


That in or about and during the month of July 1990 up to September 1990,
 in the Municipality of Antipolo, Province of Rizal, Philippines, within
 the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with
 intent to defraud New Durawood Company Inc., herein represented by one,
 Wilson M. Gaw and by means of deceit and false representation, did then
 and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously make out and issue 
Security Bank and Trust Company Check No. 293232 postdated October 1, 
1990 in the amount of P254,037.00, to apply on account, well-knowing at 
the time of issue he did not have sufficient funds in or credit with the
 drawee bank for the payment in full of the face amount of such check 
upon its presentment, which check when presented for payment within 
ninety (90) days from the date thereof was subsequently dishonored by 
the drawee bank for the reason of Drawn Against Insufficient Funds and, 
despite receipt of notice of such dishonor the accused failed to pay 
said payee the face amount of said check or make arrangement for full 
payment thereof within three (3) days after receiving notice, to the 
damage and prejudice of the said New Durawood Company, Inc. in the 
aforementioned amount of P254,037.00.


CONTRARY TO LAW.
[1]





    Upon arraignment, appellant, assisted by counsel, entered a plea of 
not guilty to the charge.
[2]

 Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.  Subsequently, the trial court 
rendered its verdict finding appellant guilty as charged.  The 
dispositive portion of its decision reads:
  





WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, and computing the penalty 
corresponding to the P254,037.00 amount defrauded in accordance with the
 foregoing provision, the Court hereby sentences accused Mario Myrno Tan
 to suffer the penalty of 
Reclusion Perpetua
 (the 
Indeterminate
 Sentence Law not being applicable to persons convicted of offenses 
punished with death or life imprisonment (Section 2, Act. No. 4105 as 
amended by Act. No. 4225), the Court cannot therefore impose a minimum 
penalty that is one degree lower than 
Reclusion 
Perpetua
).  In 
addition accused is likewise sentenced to indemnify complainant New 
Durawood Company the amount of P254,037.00 by way of actual damages plus
 legal interest and to pay the Costs.


SO ORDERED.
[3]





    In view of the penalty imposed, the case is now before us on appeal.
  



  The facts of this case on record are as follows:
  





Private complainant New Durawood Company is engaged in the buy and sell 
of construction materials, with Wilson Gaw (Gaw) serving as manager of 
its branch in Mayamot, Antipolo, Rizal.  Appellant Mario Myrno Tan, 
owner of Hocson Trading, was among the regular customers of the company.


As a matter of practice between the parties, appellant would first place
 his orders for construction materials with private complainant.  Then 
private complainant would compute the total amount involved and then 
show it to appellant.  Thereafter, the company would prepare the invoice
 and appellant would issue post-dated checks in payment for the ordered 
supplies.  The materials would then be delivered later either to 
appellantâs warehouse in Caloocan City or the construction site.  It was
 appellantâs caretaker who received the materials and signed the 
delivery receipts.


Complainantâs branch manager, Wilson Gaw, testified that:


Sometime in July or August 1990, appellant came to his store to procure 
construction supplies.  After computing the total amount of the ordered 
materials, appellant issued a check.  Appellant told Gaw about his 
(appellantâs) big construction project and assured Gaw that the check 
appellant would issue as payment for the materials was as good as cash. 
 Because of appellantâs representation, Gaw accepted appellantâs 
Security Bank and Trust Company (SBTC) Check No. 293232 post-dated 
October 1, 1990, in the amount of P254,037.00 corresponding to the 
amount of materials that appellant ordered.  Thereafter, deliveries were
 made as evidenced by the following invoices

The SBTC check paid by appellant was deposited by private complainant at
 the Rizal Commercial and Banking Corporation.  But the check was 
dishonored as it was drawn against insufficient funds.


Another witness for the prosecution, Sylvia Gaerlan, testified that she 
was the current account bookkeeper of SBTC at Salcedo Village, Makati.  
She said that she called up appellant to inform him of the dishonor of 
said check, but it was only appellantâs secretary who answered.  The 
secretary in turn informed appellant of the checkâs dishonor.


Gaw said he made several verbal demands upon appellant to make good his 
check. Gaw claimed that when he went to see appellant and demanded 
payment from the latter, appellant said that he had no money.  Next, the
 company sent a letter to appellant demanding payment of all his checks 
that bounced which amounted already to P1,657,483.61, including SBTC 
Check No. 293232.  Even after the written demand, appellant still failed
 to redeem the bouncing checks.


Finally, the company filed several criminal cases against appellant 
because of the several bouncing checks he had issued.  These criminal 
cases were filed in the different branches of the Regional Trial Court 
in Antipolo, Rizal.  The present case involves only the abovecited SBTC 
check.


Appellant was arrested on February 7, 1991 pursuant to the order of 
arrest issued by the trial court.  Upon application, appellant was 
allowed to post bail for his provisional liberty.  Thereafter, on motion
 of the prosecution, the trial court directed the Commissioner of 
Immigration and Deportation to include appellant in its hold order list 
to prevent appellant from leaving the country.
[5]



On the scheduled date of arraignment on March 13, 1991, appellant failed
 to appear and so the trial court ordered his immediate arrest.  But in 
view of the valid reason manifested by appellant, the trial court 
recalled the warrant for appellantâs arrest.  Nonetheless, appellant 
failed to appear for his arraignment on July 10, 1991.  Accordingly, the
 trial court issued an alias warrant for appellantâs arrest and 
cancelled his bail bond in favor of the government.  In the meantime, 
the case was archived until the appellant could be apprehended.  On 
August 22, 1992, private complainant informed the trial court that 
appellant was being detained at the PNP Criminal Investigation Service 
field office in Cainta, Rizal in connection with other criminal cases 
filed against appellant.  Based on said information, the trial court 
ordered the jail warden in PNP CIS in Cainta, Rizal to bring the 
appellant for the arraignment on October 21, 1992.  Just the same, 
appellant failed to appear during said hearing.
[6]



Later on, the police reported that appellant escaped from their 
detention center.  On January 24, 1993, appellant was rearrested and 
then detained at the Rizal Provincial Jail.  When he was finally 
arraigned on May 10, 1993, appellant pleaded not guilty to the 
charge.
[7]



Testifying in his defense, appellant admitted issuing the check in 
question but vehemently denied having received the materials he ordered.
  Thus, he claimed he did not deposit the corresponding amount to fund 
the check.  He declared that the persons who signed in the delivery 
receipts were not his authorized representatives.  He also pointed out 
that all the invoices for the materials had a stamp marking them as paid
 for by MBTC (Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company) checks which were not
 his.  He stated that Ernie Conwi, to whom the materials were delivered,
 had his own construction firm not in any way connected with his 
business.


Unfortunately, the trial court did not lend credence to the defense put 
up by appellant and on the basis of the evidence adduced by the 
prosecution, held appellant guilty as charged and sentenced him, as 
stated, to 
reclusion perpetua
.  Appellant 
seasonably filed his notice of appeal.
[8]



Appellant now asserts before us that the trial court erred:




    I
  


 â¦IN FINDING THAT THE POST-DATED CHECK [EXH. âFâ] WAS ISSUED 
IN 
PAYMENT OF AN OBLIGATION OR FOR A CONSIDERATION THAT WAS ACTUALLY 
DELIVERED TO THE ACCUSED 



    II
  


 â¦IN NOT FINDING THAT THE GOODS COVERED BY SALES INVOICES HAD
 BEEN 
PAID FOR BY CHECKS BELONGING TO ANOTHER PERSON AND NOT TO THE 
ACCUSED-APPELLANT 



    III
  


 â¦IN HOLDING THAT THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED ESTABLISHES BEYOND 
REASONABLE DOUBT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED FOR THE CRIME CHARGED 




    IV
  


 â¦IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED OF THE CRIME CHARGED.
[9]







The main issue is whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support
 the conviction of the appellant for estafa beyond reasonable doubt.  In
 resolving this issue, we must inquire whether all the elements of 
estafa have been proved.  In particular, we must find out if there was 
consideration for the issuance of the cited bouncing check.


Appellant contends that the prosecution failed to sufficiently prove 
that the merchandise he ordered were delivered to and received by him or
 his authorized representatives.  Thus, appellant argues, he cannot be 
held liable for estafa since he was not able to obtain goods from the 
private complainant by means of the check he issued.


After a close study of the evidence on record in this case, we are 
convinced that the trial court erred in finding that appellantâs check 
was issued for consideration.  Hence, it also erred in convicting 
appellant.  We shall now discuss these points in detail.


Article 315 (2)(d) of the Revised Penal Code penalizes any person who 
shall defraud another by postdating a check or issuing a check in 
payment of an obligation when the offender has no funds in the bank or 
his funds deposited therein are not sufficient to cover the amount of 
check.  The elements therefore of this form of estafa are (1) postdating
 or issuing a check in payment of an obligation contracted at the time 
the check was issued; (2) lack or insufficiency of funds to cover the 
check; and (3) damage to the payee thereof.  Damage and deceit are 
essential elements of the offense and must be established with 
satisfactory proof to warrant conviction.  The false pretense or 
fraudulent act must be committed prior to or simultaneously with the 
issuance of the bad check.
[10]



The transaction between the parties here is in the nature of contract of
 sale whereby private complainant (seller) obligates itself to deliver 
construction materials to appellant (buyer) who, in turn, binds himself 
to pay therefor a sum of money or its equivalent (price).  The contract 
of purchase and sale is reciprocal and from it arises not only the 
obligation to deliver the thing but also that of paying the price.  
There is actual delivery when the thing sold is placed in the control 
and possession of the buyer or his agent.
[11]



In this case, there is no ample proof that appellant or his 
representatives ever received the merchandise ordered.  On the contrary,
 witness Gaw himself admitted that the construction materials were 
received by Ernie Conwi, Nards Gabatin and an unidentified person, all 
of whom were not authorized by appellant.  Nor was it shown that these 
persons turned over the merchandise to appellant. During his 
cross-examination, Gaw declared:




    ATTY.  BELLA RAMONA ANTONANO
  



    Q: Mr. Witness, for how long has the accused been your customer?
      

      A: I cannot recall, mam, for quite 6 months.
  



    Q: So, when he orders from you, who usually receive the goods he 
orders from you?
      

      A: It is only his caretaker, mam.
  



    Q:  Were you ever furnish (sic) the name of the caretaker of Mr. Tan
 to receive the goods?
      

      A: No, mam.
  



    Q:  So, you do not know as to who are these persons that receive for
 and in behalf of Mr. Tan?
      

      A:  No, but Mr. Tan said at his given address he has a person 
right there to receive those goods.
  



    Q:  And that at any rate no name has given to you by Mr. Tan as to 
who is going to receive the goods to be delivered?
      

      A:  Yes, mam.
  


 Q:  So, May I refer to your Exhibit âAâ, your sales invoice 
marked
 as Exhibit âAâ there appears to be a name Ernie Conwi which was also 
marked as Exhibit âA-1â for the prosecution.  Now, do you know if this 
person is an authorized representative of Mr. Tan? 



    ATTY. DIAZ III:  You honor, I think the best evidence would be the 
document itself.
  



    ATTY. ANTONANO:  Yes, your honor.
  



    ATTY. DIAZ III:  What does the document say, counsel?
  



    ATTY. ANTONANO:  Received the above goods in good order and 
condition.  My question is do you know if this person is authorized 
representative of Mr. Tan to receive goods in his behalf?
  



    COURT: Witness may answer.
  



    A:  No, but the address given here as per instruction of Mr. Tan he 
has the person who will receive these goods.
  



    Q:  But only a person you do not know of who specifically the person
 who will going to receive  this?
      

      A:  Yes, mam.
  



    ATTY. ANTONANO:
  


 Q:  And also showing to you Exhibits âBâ, âCâ and âEâ there 
appears also here the name Nards A. Gabatin for these 3 exhibits, do you
 know if this person is an authorized representative of Mr. Tan to 
receive? 

    A:  No.
  


 Q:  And also on Exhibit âDâ there also appears a signature 
which 
cannot be determine (sic) who is the person signing for in this 
particular receipt.  So, you do not know also who is this person who 
receive (sic) the goods which you delivered to Mr. Tan? 

    A:  Yes, mam.
  



    Q: Now, Mr. witness, in that particular case is it not the policy of
 your office also to ascertain whether the persons who received the 
items or the goods are authorized representative of your customer?
      

      A:  No, mam.
  



    Q: Despite the substantial amount involved in the receipt, Mr. 
Witness?

    A:  Yes, mam.
[12]







Furthermore, the records indicate that the materials, although addressed
 to Hocson Trading, were delivered to Conwiâs apartment in Karangalan 
Village, Cainta, Rizal.
[13]
 
This contravenes the standing arrangement between the parties.  As a 
matter of practice, the merchandise should have been sent to appellantâs
 warehouse or the construction site designated by appellant.  This fact 
lends credence to appellantâs assertion that he did not receive the 
materials he ordered.


Another factor which bolsters appellantâs defense is the fact that the 
invoices showed the materials were paid for by checks not belonging to 
appellant.  Note that appellant was charged here of estafa for obtaining
 merchandise from the offended party by means of the SBTC Check No. 
293232 he issued.  But, as appellant pointed out, Sales Invoices Nos. 
17442 and 15117 bear the stamp âPAIDâ and the handwritten notation 
reading âMB


TC 062382  9/19â while Sales Invoices Nos. 15307, 15308 and 15309 
contain a similar stamp âPAIDâ and a notation âMBTC  062392  9/27â.  
Appellant stated that he does not have an account with MBTC, a claim not
 disputed by the prosecution. Hence, we can reasonably conclude that the
 merchandise covered by the aforesaid invoices were paid by MBTC Check 
Nos. 062382 and 062392 presumably drawn by another person, but not by 
appellant.  Nor did they involve SBTC Check No. 293232 that appellant 
earlier issued though postdated October 1, 1990.


Clearly, one element of estafa is missing in this case: no damage was 
sustained by private complainant by reason of appellantâs issuance of 
his check.  Based on the documentary and testimonial evidence, it was 
not proved that appellant received something of value from private 
complainant.  Appellant had no obligation to pay him, or to make good 
the SBTC check.  The evidence consisting of the invoices, deliveries of 
materials and the bouncing MBTC checks does not and could not 
incriminate appellant.  Consequently, appellant cannot be held guilty of
 estafa for lack of evidence against him.



WHEREFORE,
 appellant MARIO MYRNO TAN is 
hereby 
ACQUITTED of the charge against him.  He is ordered immediately RELEASED
 from confinement unless held for some other legal cause.  No costs.



SO ORDERED.
