CONTRARY TO LAW."
[3]






With the appellant, assisted by Atty. Dionisio E. Bala, Jr., pleading not guilty upon arraignment
[4]

 on April 5, 1995, trial ensued with the prosecution presenting Marilou 
Dabo, Tomas Pabigayan, Romeo (Romy) Bariza, Pantaleon Tagora, Elpidio 
Rivera, SPO2 Joselito Apalisoc, SPO1 Elmo Bungag, Edgar Valle, Geronimo 
Rivera, Dr. Inocencio R. Agpaoa and Federico Angeles, as its witnesses.

The defense called on Victoriano Dy, Romeo Estacio, Precila 
Labuguen, Lt. David Palaganas, Tranquilino Cagurangan, Jessie Cabbab and
 Orlando Ramos and the appellant himself to testify.

The facts that matter are synthesized in the decision of the trial court as follows:



"xxx Bonifacio Angeles, 56, (Bonifacio) was engaged in the business
 of buying cows which he sold at the public market. Although he was 
married to Damasa Gante with whom he had nine (9) children, he lived 
with another woman, Marilou Dabo, 28, at Coloma Village, San Fermin, 
Cauayan, Isabela. They begot two (2) children during their ten (10) 
years of coverture. 


Early in the morning of October 27, 1994, Tomas Pagbigayan (sic) 
(Tomas) went to the house of Bonifacio at San Fermin. Tomas offered two 
cows to sell to Bonifacio. Bonifacio said that when he has time, he will
 go and see the cows. After their talk Bonifacio gave Tomas a lift on 
his Honda Sports XL100 motorcycle and accompanied him to the crossing 
where he could take a ride home. Tomas sat on the backseat of the 
motorcycle.
  


Marilou Dabo declared that when Bonifacio returned home, the 
accused Vivencio (Dencio) Labuguen was with him. The accused sat behind 
Bonifacio who drove the motorcycle.
  


The accused stayed on the porch of the house. Marilou Dabo served 
him coffee. The accused told Bonifacio that he knows of three big cows 
for sale and that the place where they are is near. Bonifacio said that 
he will go and see the cows, after breakfast.
  


Marilou Dabo declared in her testimony that the accused had a 
handkerchief tied around his forehead as a headband. He was wearing dark
 sunglasses, dark jacket and a faded maong pants. He wore rubber 
slippers. Marilou Dabo recognized him as the accused Vivencio Labuguen 
because before October 27, 1994, the accused had already come to their 
house and offered to sell a lot to Bonifacio. After Bonifacio finished 
his breakfast, he went to the porch and talked to the accused for about 
fifteen (15) minutes. Marilou Dabo was in the kitchen three meters away 
from them.
  


Bonifacio entered their room and took P40,000.00 from the cabinet. 
Bonifacio got P40,000.00 because the accused told him the cows are big. 
He counted the money and placed it inside his pocket. Marilou Dabo was 
beside him. She saw Bonifacio count the P40,000.00 in P1,000.00, P500.00
 and P100.00 bills.
  


Then Bonifacio and the accused rode on the motorcycle. Bonifacio 
drove the motorcycle. The accused was seated behind Bonifacio. This was 
past 
8:00 o'clock
 in the morning of October 27, 1994.
  


Bonifacio and accused Vivencio Labuguen passed by the house of 
Romeo Bariza, 47, farmer, who resided in San Fermin, Cauayan. His house 
was 120 meters away from the house of Bonifacio. Bariza was the planting
 'kahoy' when he saw at a distance of 20 meters Bonifacio and the 
accused pass by riding on a motorcycle color (sic) red and black, 
running slowly because the road was full of potholes. Bariza declared 
that Bonifacio and the accused glanced at him. He recognized Bonifacio 
because he is his compadre and the accused because he had known him 
months before that date. Accused was wearing sunglasses and a cloth on 
his forehead. In Court, Bariza identified the accused Vivencio Labuguen 
as the same person he saw riding with Bonifacio that morning of October 
27, 1994, while he was planting 'kahoy.'
  


Tomas declared that he was not able to get immediately a ride going
 home. While at the crossing waiting for a ride, he saw Bonifacio and 
the accused Vivencio Labuguen. They rode on a motorcycle driven by 
Bonifacio. The accused sat on the backseat of the motorcycle. They 
glanced at Tomas. Tomas saw the face of the accused who was wearing 
sunglasses with a handkerchief tied around his forehead. Tomas 
recognized the accused Vivencio Labuguen because on October 22, 1994, he
 saw him talking to Romy Bariza on the road in front of the latter's 
house in San Fermin. When the accused left, he (Tomas) asked Romy Bariza
 who was the person he talked with and he answered, 'Dencio.' Dencio is 
the nickname of the accused Vivencio Labuguen. Accused then left driving
 a tricycle.
  


At about 
10:00 o'clock
 that morning of October 27, 1994, 
Pantaleon Tagora, 55, farmer and a resident of Ramona, Angadanan, was on
 his way home. He had just come from his cornfield. He was walking on 
top of the irrigation canal near the service drop when he met two (2) 
male persons. One was younger than the other. The young one wore a 
jacket which was quite yellow. His face was quite round. He was not 
wearing sunglasses or headband. In Court, Tagora identified the younger 
person as Vivencio Labuguen. (TSN p. 10, Tagora, July 5, 1995). The 
older one wore a faded maong pants. His face was quite elongated. They 
were seated four (4) meters apart. Tagora first met the older male 
person. This place where Tagora met them was one and a half kilometers 
from his house.
  


Tagora passed by the two persons without talking to them. After 
walking 200 meters away from them, he saw a motorcycle parked on the 
way.
  


The top of the irrigation canal was used as an exit road to the 
National Highway between Alicia on the South and Cauayan on the North. 
(TSN - Dr Agpaoa, p. 13, October 31, 1995)
  


Elpidio Rivera, 31, farmer and a resident of Barangay Viga, 
Angadanan, one (1) kilometer West of Ramona, was sundrying (sic) his 
corn on the concrete edge of the road near his house at about 
10:30 o'clock

 that morning of October 27, 1994. This road goes to Angadanan and then 
to Cauayan (TSN p. 7, Elpidio Rivera, August 16, 1995). His attention 
was attracted by a loud roar of a motorcycle coming towards his place. 
Elpidio stopped working. At a distance he saw a person riding on a red 
motorcycle (sports type). He came from the West from Ramona and going 
towards the East. When it was near the place where Elpidio was drying 
corn, the motorcycle slowed down because it was a curve. Elpidio 
declared in court that he saw the face of the motorcycle rider: quite 
round, wearing a light yellow jacket with a handkerchief around his 
forehead. The handkerchief was black with red dots. He was 6 to 7 meters
 from Elpidio when he passed by. In Court, Elpidio readily identified 
the accused Vivencio Labuguen as the person he saw riding on the 
motorcycle. (TSN - Rivera, p. 8, August 16, 1995)
  


Between 
11:00 to 12:00 o'clock
 noon on October 27, 1994, 
Geronimo Rivera, 45, was driving a Challenger, a passenger mini-bus 
(sic), at Barangay Nappaccu Grande (Nappaccu), Reina Mercedes, Isabela. 
His conductor was Eduardo Valle, 20. They came from Santiago, Isabela, 
bound for Tuguegarao, Cagayan. There were passengers in the bus.
  


At Nappaccu, Geromino Rivera (Rivera) saw at a distance of 200 
meters, a person behind some talahibs near the National Highway. When 
the mini-bus (sic) came near to a distance of 50 meters from the person,
 Rivera noticed that he was wiping something on his right hand and right
 face. When the mini-bus (sic) was near, the person flagged it down. The
 bus stopped. Rivera saw a Honda XL100 motorcycle three (3) meters from 
the person near the edge of the highway.
  


Conductor Eduardo Valle, went down the minibus (sic) to allow the 
person to get inside the bus. He observed that his clothes, particularly
 the right side of his jacket and the right side of his pants, was 
soaked with blood. He was wearing a cream jacket, maong pants, 
sunglasses and a handkerchief tied around his forehead. Eduardo Valle 
thought he met an accident but when he looked at the Honda XL100 
motorcycle parked behind the person, it was not damaged and that he had 
no injuries.
  


The person sat on the 5th row seat, a 3-seater, on the left. He was
 alone there. The 4th, 3rd, 2nd and 1st row of seats were vacant. He 
placed the palm of his hands behind his head. He acted as if he was 
looking for something which he could not find. Rivera could see him 
clearly on the big rear view mirror (1 foot by 1/2) above him.
  


Conductor Eduardo Valle went to him and asked him where he was 
going but the person did not answer, instead, without saying anything, 
he gave a P10.00 bill to Eduardo Valle. He asked the person where he was
 going to alight so he could give him his change, but the person did not
 answer. Eduardo Valle declared in Court that he saw the breast pocket 
of the jacket of the person full of money, two inches thick P100.00 
bills. One bill was falling, so Eduardo Valle told the person, 'Brod, 
your money is falling.'
  


In Court, Geronimo Rivera and Eduardo Valle positively identified 
the person who rode on the mini-bus (sic) with blood-soaked clothes and 
plenty of money on the breast pocket of his jacket as the accused 
Vivencio Labuguen. They also positively identified the Honda XL100 
(Exhibit 'G') as the same motorcycle behind the accused which was left 
when he boarded the mini-bus (sic) at Nappaccu.
  


When some passengers alighted at the junction of the road in 
Naguillan going to San Mariano, Isabela, the accused suddenly stoop up 
and alighted from the mini-bus (sic). He did not even get his change.
  


Going back to Pantaleon Tagora at Ramona, Angadanan. Between 
1:00 to 2:00 o'clock

 in the afternoon of October 27, 1994 while he was in his house at 
Ramona, he heard that a dead person was found near the irrigation canal.
 He and his neighbors went to see the dead person. He was surprised to 
see that the dead person was the same older person who was the companion
 of the younger one he met that morning. He identified the younger 
person as the accused. The body of the deceased was on the middle of a 
ricefield (sic), 50 meters from the service drop of the irrigation 
canal.
  


At about 
5:00 o'clock
 that afternoon of October 27, 1994, 
Dr. Agpaoa in the presence of Mayor Ong and Chief of Police Redentor 
Garcia of Angadanan, Isabela, conducted an examination of the body of 
the deceased person at the middle of a ricefield (sic) in Barangay 
Ramona, Angadanan. The dead person was identified as Bonifacio Angeles 
by his brother Federico Angeles. Dr. Agpaoa wrote his findings while on 
the ricefield (sic). Later, after examining again the body at the 
Funeraria, he put his findings into final form in his Autopsy Report 
marked Exhibit 'K'. In his Autopsy Report, Dr. Agpaoa found the 
following wounds on the body of the deceased Bonifacio Angeles, thus:
  


'Postmortem Findings
  


1. Gunshot wound, entrance left, inferior margin of left clavicle, 
slightly outside the left midclavicular line, directed slightly 
downward, backward and medially.
  


2. Gunshot wound, entrance, right side of the thoracic cage, along 
slight anterior axillary line, between 6th & 5th costal interspace, 
directed medially. 


3. Stab wound, left temporal area, above the left ear.
  


4. Stab wound, supra sternal notch (deep) penetrating chest cavity.
  


5. Stab wound, supra clavicular area, downwards, penetrating chest cavity.
  


6. Multiple superficial stab wound over anterior chest wall and abdominal wall.
  


7. Stab wound on both thighs, anterior surface. Cause of death - Internal Hemorrhage.'

The heirs of Bonifacio Angeles spent P55,000.00 for his burial (Exhibit 'L')."
[5]






Appellant placed reliance on his defense of denial and alibi. 
Vehemently denying the charge against him, he asseverated that he could 
not have committed the crime on October 27, 1994 because he left for 
Maconacon, Isabela on October 17, 1994, to manage the logging operation 
of a certain Orlando Ramos and stayed there until December 20, 1994.
[6]


On October 7, 1996, the trial court handed down its decision under review. The defense theorized that:



I
  


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED ON THE BASIS OF 
SURMISES, SPECULATIONS, INSUFFICIENT AND INCREDIBLE CIRCUMSTANTIAL 
EVIDENCE;
  


II
  


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN TOTALLY DISREGARDING THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE DEFENSE; and
  


III
  


THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
[7]






Circumstantial evidence is that which indirectly proves a fact in 
issue. The fact-finder must draw an inference from such evidence. It is 
at times essential to resort to circumstantial evidence since to insist 
on direct testimony would, in many cases, result in setting felons free 
and deny proper protection to society. An accused can be convicted on 
the basis of circumstantial evidence where the circumstances constitute 
an unbroken chain leading to one fair reasonable conclusion and pointing
 to the accused, to the exclusion of all others, as the guilty person.
[8]
 Under Section 4, Rule 134 of the Rules on Evidence, circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if:



a) There is more than one circumstance;
  


b) The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and
  


c) The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.
  




In the case under consideration, the testimonies of the prosecution 
witnesses spawn and generate the following facts which constitute an 
unbroken chain of events leading to the inevitable conclusion of guilt 
on the part of the appellant, to wit:



1. In the early morning of October 27, 1994, appellant went to the 
house of the victim to convince him to purchase the cows offered for 
sale.
  


2. The victim agreed to see the cows, bringing along with him - 
P40,000.00. Thus, at around 8:00 in the morning of the same day, the 
victim and the appellant rode on the motorcycle of the victim with the 
latter as the driver.
  


3. At past 8:00 in the morning of October 27, 1994, prosecution 
witness Romeo Bariza saw the victim and appellant riding on a 
motorcycle.
  


4. At about 10:00 of the same day, the victim and the appellant 
were seen sitting on top of an irrigation canal at Barangay Ramona, 
Angadanan, Isabela.
  


5. Around 10:30 in the morning of October 27, 1994, appellant was 
seen alone on the motorcycle of the victim, speeding away from Barangay 
Ramona.
  


6. Between 11:00 to 12:00 noon of October 27, 1994, appellant rode a
 minibus leaving the motorcycle of the victim on the shoulder of the 
road.
  


7. The bus conductor noticed that the right side of appellant's 
jacket and pants were soaked with blood, and there were two inches-thick
 of one hundred peso bills tucked in the breast pocket of appellant's 
jacket.
  


8. Between 1:00 to 2:00 in the afternoon of the same day, the dead 
body of the victim with gunshot and stab wounds was found by the 
residents of Barangay Ramona, 150 meters from the irrigation canal.
  


9. Around 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon also of the same day, the 
municipal health officer, the chief of police, the mayor, and some peace
 officers of Angadanan, Isabela, proceeded to the place where the body 
of the unidentified victim was found (Exhibit "J", O.R., p. 156; and 
TSN, p. 4, October 31, 1995, direct exam. of Dr. Agpaoa). 


10. Federico Angeles identified the deceased as his brother Bonifacio Angeles (Exhibit "K", O.R., p. 157.). 




After a careful study, the Court is of the ineluctable finding and 
conclusion that the aforementioned circumstantial evidence has 
established the guilt of appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The time 
element of the circumstances thus proven link each chain of 
circumstances to another pointing to a reasonable conclusion and no 
other but the guilt of appellant. From the early morning of October 27, 
1994 to 10:00 o'clock in the morning of the same day, the prosecution 
has sufficiently shown that the appellant was the last person seen with 
the victim before the latter was killed. About thirty minutes later, 
appellant was seen speeding away from Barangay Ramona where he and the 
victim were previously spotted by one of the prosecution witnesses. And,
 escaping from the consequences of his felonious act, appellant, boarded
 a minibus, leaving the motorcycle of the victim on the side of the 
road. All the foregoing circumstances, coupled with the fact that 
appellant had two inches thick of one hundred peso bills in his 
possession when he rode on the minibus with his jacket and pants 
splattered with blood, suffice to prove beyond reasonable doubt the 
guilt of appellant of the crime of 
robo con homicido
 perpetrated in the morning of October 27, 1994.

In 
People vs. Asis
,
[9]

 the Court affirmed the conviction of the accused of the crime of 
homicide on the basis of circumstantial evidence, holding thus:



"xxx We find that all these requisites have been successfully 
met by the prosecution. The evidence showed that appellant was one of 
two persons last seen in the company of the victim before he was killed.
 On the morning that the victim's body was found, the appellant was 
observed with his clothes smeared with blood. Witness dela Cruz saw his 
left shoulder with bite marks and his right hand swollen. When asked 
about the injuries, he admitted engaging in a fight in Bgy. 
Pinakpinakan. On the same morning, some CAFGU soldiers spotted the 
appellant with co-accused Mendoza while walking by the road in Bgy. 
Caingin. They had blood-stained clothes. The two ran away, when pursued.
 Their flight evinces guilt. These circumstances taken together lead to 
no other conclusion but that the appellant is guilty as charged."
[10]






Appellant's intention to rob the victim can be gleaned unerringly 
from the attendant circumstances. Obviously, robbery was the motive that
 impelled appellant to convince the victim to go with him. Under the 
pretext of selling cows to him, appellant cajoled the victim to bring a 
large sum of money and thereafter, lured him to a route where appellant 
could divest him of his money with the least danger of being caught. As 
aptly surmised by the trial court, the two inches thick of one hundred 
peso bills in appellant's pocket and the blood smeared on his clothes 
are two vital chains of circumstances that undoubtedly bespeak of the 
robbery with homicide appellant committed.

The lower court erred not in giving full weight and credence to 
the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses particularly identifying 
appellant as the person last seen in the company of the victim before 
the latter was found dead. The testimonies on record are clear and 
straightforward. And, finding the witnesses for the People not 
ill-motivated to testify against the appellant, the Court discerns no 
basis for doubting their credibility.
[11]

 Moreover, it is a jurisprudentially-embedded rule that on the issue of 
credibility of witnesses, appellate courts generally do not disturb the 
findings of the trial court, considering its singular opportunity to 
observe the deportment and manner of testifying of the witnesses.
[12]


Disowning liability for the commission of the crime complained 
of, appellant theorized that he was in Maconacon, Isabela, from October 
17, 1994 up to December 20, 1994. The Court, however, finds no 
credibility in the alibi theorized upon by appellant. It bears stressing
 that for alibi to prosper, appellant must prove that he was somewhere 
else when the crime was committed and it was physically impossible for 
him to have been at the scene of the crime.
[13]
 In the present case of appellant, he failed to establish the requisite physical impossibility of his presence at the 
locus criminis

 at the approximate time of its commission. Granting arguendo that the 
appellant really went to Maconacon, Isabela on October 17, 1994, it was 
easy for him to go back by plane or by boat to Cauayan, Isabela, on or 
before October 27, 1994.

Furthermore, and more importantly, the defense of alibi of 
appellant cannot prevail over his positive identification by the 
prosecution witnesses.
[14]


Though not alleged in the Information, the generic aggravating 
circumstances of fraud and craft were properly appreciated by the trial 
court.
[15]
 Craft involves 
intellectual trickery and cunning on the part of the offender. When 
there is a direct inducement by insidious words or machinations, fraud 
is present.
[16]
 By saying that
 he would accompany the victim to see the cows which the latter intended
 to buy, appellant was able to lure the victim to go with him.

Under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for Robbery with Homicide is 
reclusion perpetua

 to death. Applying Article 63 of the same Code, the impossable penalty 
under the premises is death in view of the presence of the aggravating 
circumstances of craft and fraud and the absence of any mitigating 
circumstance.

Four members of the Court are steadfast in their adherence to the separate opinion expressed in 
People vs. Echegaray

 that Republic Act No. 7659 is unconstitutional insofar as it prescribes
 the death penalty. However, they bow to the majority opinion that the 
aforesaid law is constitutional and therefore, the penalty prescribed 
thereunder has to be imposed.

WHEREFORE
, the Decision dated October 7, 1996 of
 the Regional Trial Court, Branch 20, Cauayan, Isabela, in Criminal Case
 No. 20-738, finding appellant VIVENCIO LABUGUEN @ DENCIO guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with homicide, and imposing 
upon him the penalty of DEATH, is AFFIRMED.

In accordance with Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659 amending 
Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, upon finality of this decision, 
let the records of the case be forwarded to the Office of the President 
for the possible exercise of the pardoning power. Costs against the 
appellant.
