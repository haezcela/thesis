FRANK UY AND UNIFISH PACKING CORPORATION, PETITIONERS, VS. BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE AND HON. MERCEDES GOZO-DADOLE, RESPONDENTS.
D E C I S I O N




KAPUNAN, J.:


Petitioners assail the validity of the warrants issued for the search of the 
premises of the Unifish Packing Corporation, and pray for the return of the 
items seized by virtue thereof. 


On 30 September 1993, a certain Rodrigo Abos reported to the Bureau of 
Internal Revenue (BIR) that petitioners Unifish Packing Corporation and Uy Chin 
Ho 
alias
 Frank Uy were engaged in activities constituting violations of 
the National Internal Revenue Code. Abos, who claimed to be a former employee of 
Unifish, executed an Affidavit
[1]
 
stating: 


He has personal knowledge that UNIFISH PACKING CORPORATION (hereinafter 
referred to as UNIFISH), a canning factory located at Hernan Cortes Street, 
under the active management of UY CHIN HO alias Frank Uy [,] is selling by the 
thousands of [sic] cartons of canned sardines without issuing receipt. This is 
in violation of Sections 253 and 263 of the Internal Revenue Code.


This grand scale tax fraud is perpetrated through the following scheme: 





(1) Uy Chin Ho a director of UNIFISH buys in bulk from the company; 


(2) Being a director, Uy Chin Ho has a lot of clout in the distribution of 
the canned sardines processed by UNIFISH; 


(3) Uy Chin Ho dictates the value of canned sardines that he orders and buys 
from UNIFISH without any receipt of his purchases;


(4) The moment he has the quantity he wants, UNIFISH through Uy Chin Ho 
delivers to the different supermarkets such as White Gold, Gaisano, etc.;


(5) Payments made by these tax evading establishments are made by checks 
drawn payable to cash and delivered to Uy Chin Ho; These payments are also not 
receipted (sic);


(6) Uy Chin Ho will then pay UNIFISH for the quantity of sardines he had 
withdrawn from the corporation; 


Another fraudulent practice perpetrated by UNIFISH through Uy Chin Ho's 
direction is the sale of imported oil locally to different customers. This is a 
case of smuggling in the sense that UNIFISH, being an export company registered 
with the Board of Investments, is enjoying certain exemptions in their 
importation of oil as one of the raw materials in its processing of canned tuna 
for export. These tax exemptions are granted by the government on the condition 
that the oil is to be used only in the processing of tuna for export and that it 
is not to be sold unprocessed as is to local customers.


Another fraudulent practice involves the sales of unused cans; UNIFISH also 
enjoys tax exemptions in its purchases of tin cans subject to the condition that 
these are to be used as containers for its processed tuna for export. These cans 
are never intended to be sold locally to other food processing 
companies.


Prior to 1990, that is from 1980 to 1990, the factory of the UNIFISH PACKING 
CORPORATION was then run by the PREMIER INDUSTRIAL & DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION 
(hereinafter referred to as PREMIER) [,] which corporation was being controlled 
by the same majority stockholders as those now running and controlling UNIFISH; 
[a]t that time, PREMIER was also committing the same fraudulent acts as what is 
being perpetrated by UNIFISH at present.


The records containing entries of actual volume of production and sales, of 
both UNIFISH AND PREMIER, are found in the office of the corporation at its 
factory site at H. Cortes Street, Mandaue City. The particular place or spot 
where these records [official receipts, sales invoices, delivery receipts, sales 
records or sales books, stock cards, accounting records (such as ledgers, 
journals, cash receipts books, and check disbursements books)] are kept and may 
be found is best described in the herein attached sketch of the arrangement of 
the office's furniture and fixture of the corporation which is made an integral 
part hereof and marked as Annex "A",


He is executing this affidavit to attest under oath the veracity of the 
foregoing allegations and he is reserving his right to claim for reward under 
the provisions of Republic Act No. 2338. 


On 1 October 1993, Nestor N. Labaria, Assistant Chief of the Special 
Investigation Branch of the BIR, applied for search warrants from Branch 28 of 
the Regional Trial Court of Cebu. The application sought permission to search 
the premises of Unifish.


After hearing the depositions of Labaria and Abos, Judge Mercedes Gozo-Dadole 
issued the disputed search warrants. The first
[2]
 is docketed as "SEARCH WARRANT NO. 
93-10-79 FOR: VIOLATION OF SECTION 253" ("Search Warrant A-1"), and consists of 
two pages. A verbatim reproduction of Search Warrant A-1 appears below:

Judge 


Judge Gozo-Dadole issued a third warrant,
[4]
 which was docketed as "SEARCH WARRANT 
93-10-80 FOR: VIOLATION OF SEC. 238 in relation to SEC. 263" (hereinafter, 
"Search Warrant B"). Except for the docket number and the designation of the 
crime in the body of the warrant ("Section 238 in relation to Sec. 263 - 
non-issuance of sales invoice and use and possession of unregistered delivery 
receipts and/or sales invoices"), Search Warrant B is a verbatim reproduction of 
Search Warrant A-2.


On the strength of these warrants, agents of the BIR, accompanied by members 
of the Philippine National Police, on 2 October 1993, searched the premises of 
the Unifish Packing Corporation. They seized, among other things, the records 
and documents of petitioner corporation. A return of said search was duly made 
by Nestor Labaria with the RTC of Cebu , Branch 28.


On 8 February 1995, the BIR filed against petitioners a case before the 
Department of Justice. The records, however, do not reveal the nature of this 
case.


On 31 March 1995, petitioners filed motions to quash the subject search 
warrants with Branch 28 of the Cebu RTC.


The RTC, however, denied petitioners' motions to quash as well as their 
subsequent motion for reconsideration, prompting petitioners to file a petition 
for 
certiorari
 with the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA dismissed their 
petition, holding that petitioners failed to comply with Section 2(a), Rule 6 of 
the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals (RIRCA), which states:




a. What Should be Filed. - The petition shall be filed in seven (7) legible 
copies and a copy thereof shall be served on each of the respondents, and must 
be accompanied by a certified true copy of the decision or order complained of 
and true copies of the pleadings and other pertinent documents and papers. (As 
amended by S.Ct. Res., dated November 24, 1992).


The CA found that petitioners did not submit certified true copies of (1) the 
Motions to Quash, (2) the Motion for Reconsideration, and (3) the Affidavit of 
Rodrigo Abos.


The CA also held that 
certiorari
 was not the proper remedy to question 
the resolution denying the motion to quash.




In this case now before us, the available remedies to the petitioners, 
assuming that the Department of Justice will eventually file the case, are: a 
petition for reinvestigation; the right to post bail; a Motion to Quash the 
Information; and in case of denial, an appeal, after judgment on the merits, or 
after the case shall have been tried. This brings us to the case of 
Lai vs. 
Intermediate 220 SCRA 149
 and the pronouncement, thus:




Criminal Procedure: Certiorari: Certiorari should not be allowed where 
petitioner has other remedies available. -- Anent the remedy resorted to by 
petitioners (referring to the petition for certiorari) from the Regional Trial 
Court of Negros Oriental presided by Judge Diez, the same should not have been 
granted. Petitioners were not without plain, speedy and adequate remedies in the 
ordinary course of law against Judge Lomeda's order for their arrest. These 
remedies are as enumerated by respondent appellate court in its decision: "1. 
they can post bail for their provisional release; 2. They can ask the Provincial 
Fiscal for a reinvestigation of the charge against them. If unsatisfied with the 
fiscal's resolution they can ask for a review by the Minister of Justice; (Sec. 
1(), RA 5180 as amended by P.D. 911); 3. 
if their petition for review does 
not prosper, they can file a motion to quash the information in the trial 
court.
 (Rule 117, Rules of Court). 4. 
If the motion is denied, they can 
appeal the judgment of the court after the case shall have been tried on the 
merits
. x x x 


Where motion to quash is denied, remedy is not certiorari, but to go to 
trial.-- Moreover, in the case of Acharon vs. Purisima, this Court held that 
when a motion to quash a criminal case is denied, the remedy is not certiorari 
but to go to trial without prejudice to reiterating the special defenses 
involved in said Motion. In the event that an adverse decision is rendered after 
trial on the merits, an appeal therefrom should be the next legal 
step.


xxx






In this case now before Us, there is no pretention [sic] that the Court 
issued the Search Warrants without jurisdiction. On the contrary, it had 
jurisdiction. The argument therefore that the Court committed an error in not 
describing the persons or things to be searched; that the Search Warrants did 
not describe with particularity the things to be seized/taken; the absence of 
probable cause; and for having allegedly condoned the discriminating manner in 
which the properties were taken, to us, are merely errors in the Court's 
finding, certainly not correctible by certiorari, but instead thru an 
appeal.
[5]


In any event, the CA ruled, no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of 
jurisdiction was committed by the RTC in the issuance of the warrants.


As petitioners' motion for reconsideration proved futile, petitioners filed 
the instant petition for review.


Petitioners claim that they did submit to the CA certified true copies of the 
pleadings and documents listed above along with their Petition, as well as in 
their Motion for Reconsideration. An examination of the CA 
Rollo
, 
however, reveals that petitioners first submitted the same in their Reply, after 
respondents, in their Comment, pointed out petitioners' failure to attach them 
to the Petition.


Nevertheless, the CA should not have dismissed the petition on this ground 
although, to its credit, it did touch upon the merits of the case. First, it 
appears that the case could have been decided without these pleadings and 
documents. Second, even if the CA deemed them essential to the resolution of the 
case, it could have asked for the records from the RTC. Third, in a similar 
case,
[6]
 we held that the submission of a 
document together with the motion for reconsideration constitutes substantial 
compliance with Section 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court, requiring the 
submission of a certified true copy of "material portions of the record as are 
referred to [in the petition], and other documents relevant or pertinent 
thereto" along with the petition. So should it be in this case, especially 
considering that it involves an alleged violation of a constitutionally 
guaranteed right. The rules of procedure are not to be applied in a very rigid, 
technical sense; rules of procedure are used only to help secure substantial 
justice. If a technical and rigid enforcement of the rules is made, their aim 
could be defeated.
[7]


The CA likewise erred in holding that petitioners cannot avail of 

certiorari
 to question the resolution denying their motions to quash the 
subject search warrants. We note that the case of "Lai vs. Intermediate," cited 
by the appellate court as authority for its ruling does not appear in "220 SCRA 

149
." The excerpt of the syllabus quoted by the court, as observed by 
petitioners,
[8]
 appears to have been 
taken from the case of 
Yap vs. Intermediate Appellate Court
, 220 SCRA 

245
 (1993). 
Yap
, however, is inapplicable since that case involved 
a motion to quash a 
complaint
 for qualified theft, not a motion to quash 
a 
search warrant.


The applicable case is 
Marcelo vs. De Guzman
,
[9]
 where we held that the issuing judge's 
disregard of the requirements for the issuance of a search warrant constitutes 
grave abuse of discretion, which may be remedied by 
certiorari
:




Expressly announced in Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is the 
general rule that certiorari is available where a tribunal or officer exercising 
judicial functions "has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, 
or with grave abuse of discretion and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, 
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."


In the light of the findings of the lower court, herein above quoted, it is 
indisputable that Judge de Guzman gravely abused his discretion in issuing the 
said search warrant. Indeed, he acted whimsically and capriciously when he 
ignored the explicit mandate of Section 3, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court that 
"a search warrant shall not issue but upon probable cause in connection with one 
specific offense to be determined by the municipal or city judge after 
examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he 
may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the 
persons or things to be seized; and that "no search warrant shall issue for more 
than one specific offense." 


The utter disregard by Judge de Guzman of the requirements laid down by the 
said rule renders the warrant in question absolutely null and void. It has been 
held that where the order complained of is a patent nullity, a petition for 
certiorari and mandamus may properly be entertained despite the existence of the 
remedy of appeal.


Moreover, an appeal from the order of Judge de Guzman would neither be an 
adequate nor speedy remedy to relieve appellee of the injurious effects of the 
warrant. The seizure of her personal property had resulted in the total 
paralization of the articles and documents which had been improperly seized. 
Where the remedy of appeal cannot afford an adequate and expeditious relief, 
certiorari can be allowed as a mode of redress to prevent irreparable damage and 
injury to a party.


This Court had occasion to reiterate the above pronouncement in 
Silva vs. 
Presiding Judge, RTC of Negros Oriental, Br. XXXIII
,
[10]
 which also involved a special civil 
action for 
certiorari
:
[11]
 




Thus, in issuing a search warrant, the judge must strictly comply with the 
constitutional requirement that he must determine the existence of probable 
cause by examining the applicant and his witnesses in the form of searching 
questions and answers. His failure to comply with this requirement constitutes 
grave abuse of discretion. As declared in 
Marcelo vs. De Guzman
, G.R. No. 
L-29077, June 29, 1982, 114 SCRA 657, "the capricious disregard by the judge in 
not complying with the requirements before issuance of search warrants 
constitutes grave abuse of discretion".


In this case, petitioners alleged in their petition before the CA that the 
issuing judge violated the pertinent provisions of the Constitution and the 
Rules of Court in issuing the disputed search warrants, which, if true, would 
have constituted grave abuse of discretion. Petitioners also alleged that the 
enforcers of the warrants seized almost all the records and documents of the 
corporation thus resulting in the paralysis of its business. Appeal, therefore, 
would not be an adequate remedy that would afford petitioners expeditious 
relief.


We now proceed to the merits of the case.


Section 2, Article III of the Constitution guarantees the right of the people 
against unreasonable searches and seizures:




The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and 
effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for 
any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest 
shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge 
after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses 
he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the 
persons or things to be seized.


In relation to the above provision, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court 
provides:




SEC. 3. 
Requisite for issuing search warrant. 
- A search warrant shall 
not issue but upon probable cause in connection with one specific offense to be 
determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation 
of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing 
the place to be searched and the things to be seized.


SEC. 4. 
Examination of complainant; record. 
- The judge must, before 
issuing the warrant, personally examine in the form of searching questions and 
answers, in writing and under oath the complainant and any witnesses he may 
produce on facts personally known to them and attach to the record their sworn 
statements together with any affidavits submitted.


A search warrant must conform strictly to the requirements of the foregoing 
constitutional and statutory provisions. These requirements, in outline form, 
are:




(1) the warrant must be issued upon probable cause;


(2) the probable cause must be determined by the judge himself and not by the 
applicant or any other person;


(3) in the determination of probable cause, the judge must examine, under 
oath or affirmation, the complainant and such witnesses as the latter may 
produce; and


(4) the warrant issued must particularly describe the place to be searched 
and persons or things to be seized.
[12]


The absence of any of these requisites will cause the downright nullification 
of the search warrants.
[13]
 The 
proceedings upon search warrants must be absolutely legal, "for there is not a 
description of process known to the law, the execution of which is more 
distressing to the citizen. Perhaps there is none which excites such intense 
feeling in consequence of its humiliating and degrading effect." The warrants 
will always be construed strictly without, however, going the full length of 
requiring technical accuracy. No presumptions of regularity are to be invoked in 
aid of the process when an officer undertakes to justify under it.
[14]
 


Petitioners contend that there are several defects in the subject warrants 
that command their nullification. They point out inconsistencies in the 
description of the place to be searched in Search Warrant A-1, as well as 
inconsistencies in the names of the persons against whom Search Warrants A-1 and 
A-2 were issued. That two search warrants (Search Warrants A-1 and A-2) were 
issued for the same crime, for the same place, at a single occasion is cited as 
another irregularity. Petitioners also dispute the existence of probable cause 
that would justify the issuance of the warrants. Finally, they claim that the 
things to be seized were not described with particularity. These defects, 
according to petitioners, render the objects seized inadmissible in 
evidence.
[15]


Inconsistencies in the 
description of the 
place to be 
searched


Petitioners observe that the caption of Search Warrant A-1 indicates the 
address of Uy Chin Ho alias Frank Uy as "Hernan Cortes St., 
Cebu
 City" 
while the body of the same warrant states the address as "Hernan Cortes St., 

Mandaue
 City." Parenthetically, Search Warrants A-2 and B consistently 
state the address of petitioner as "Hernan Cortes St., 
Mandaue
 City."


The Constitution requires, for the validity of a search warrant, that there 
be a particular description of "the place to be searched and the persons of 
things to be seized."
[16]
 The rule is 
that a description of a place to be searched is sufficient if the officer with 
the warrant can, with reasonable effort, ascertain and identify the place 
intended
[17]
and distinguish it from other 
places in the community.
[18]
 Any 
designation or description known to the locality that points out the place to 
the exclusion of all others, and on inquiry leads the officers unerringly to it, 
satisfies the constitutional requirement.
[19]
 Thus, in 
Castro vs. Pabalan
,
[20]
 where the search warrant mistakenly 
identified the residence of the petitioners therein as Barrio 
Padasil
 
instead of the adjoining Barrio 
Maria
 
Cristina
, this Court 
"admitted that the deficiency in the writ is not of sufficient gravity to call 
for its invalidation."


In this case, it was not shown that a street similarly named Hernan Cortes 
could be found in Cebu City. Nor was it established that the enforcing officers 
had any difficulty in locating the premises of petitioner corporation. That 
Search Warrant A-1, therefore, inconsistently identified the city where the 
premises to be searched is not a defect that would spell the warrant's 
invalidation in this case.


Inconsistencies in the 
description of the 
persons named in the 

two warrants


Petitioners also find fault in the description of the names of the persons in 
Search Warrants A-1 and A-2. Search Warrant A-1 was issued 
solely
 against 
"Uy Chin Ho alias Frank Uy." Search Warrant A-2, on the other hand, was directed 
against "UY CHIN HO alias FRANK UY, 
and
 Unifish Packing Corporation." 



These discrepancies are hardly relevant.


In 
Miller v. Sigler
,
[21]
 it was 
held that the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, from which 
Section 2, Article III of our own Constitution is historically derived, does not 
require the warrant to name the person who occupies the described premises. 
Where the search warrant is issued for the search of specifically described 
premises only and not for the search of a person, the failure to name the owner 
or occupant of such property in the affidavit and search warrant does not 
invalidate the warrant; and where the name of the owner of the premises sought 
to be searched is incorrectly inserted in the search warrant, it is not a fatal 
defect if the legal description of the premises to be searched is otherwise 
correct so that no discretion is left to the officer making the search as to the 
place to be searched.
[22]
 


Since, in the case at bar, the warrant was issued not for search of the 
persons owning or occupying the premises, but only a search of the premises 
occupied by them, the search could not be declared unlawful or in violation of 
the constitutional rights of the owner or occupants of the premises, because of 
inconsistencies in stating their names.
[23]
 


Two warrants issued 
at one time for one 
crime and one 
place


In any event, Search Warrant A-1 should be deemed superseded by Search 
Warrant A-2.


Two warrants, Search Warrants A-1 and A-2, were actually issued by the trial 
court for the same crime (violation of "SEC. 253" of the National Internal 
Revenue Code). It appears, however, that Search Warrant A-2 was issued merely to 
correct the inconsistencies in the address in Search Warrant A-1, as well as to 
include Unifish Packing Corporation as a party against whom the warrant was 
issued. Search Warrant A-2 was evidently an attempt by the issuing judge to be 
more precise in the names of the persons against whom the warrant was issued and 
in the description of the place to be searched. Indeed, it would be absurd for 
the judge to issue on a single occasion two warrants authorizing the search of a 
single place for a single offense. Inasmuch as the apparent intent in issuing 
Search Warrant A-2 was to supersede Search Warrant A-1, the latter should be 
deemed revoked by the former.


The alleged absence of
probable cause


Petitioners claim there was no probable cause for Judge Gozo-Dadole to issue 
the subject search warrants.


Probable cause is defined as such facts and circumstances which would lead a 
reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that an offense has been 
committed and that the objects sought in connection with the offense are in the 
place sought to be searched.
[24]


In the determination of probable cause, the Constitution and the Rules of 
Court require an examination of the witnesses under oath. The examination must 
be probing and exhaustive, not merely routine or 
pro forma
. The examining 
magistrate must not simply rehash the contents of the affidavit but must make 
his own inquiry on the intent and justification of the application.
[25]
 Asking of leading questions to the 
deponent in an application for search warrant, and conducting of examination in 
a general manner, would not satisfy the requirements for issuance of a valid 
search warrant.
[26]
 


The witnesses, in turn, must testify under oath to facts of their own 
personal knowledge. The oath required must refer to the truth of the facts 
within the personal knowledge of the petitioner or his witnesses, because the 
purpose thereof is to convince the committing magistrate, not the individual 
making the affidavit and seeking the issuance of the warrant, of the existence 
of probable cause.
[27]
 Search warrants 
are not issued on loose, vague or doubtful basis of fact, nor on mere suspicion 
or belief.
[28]
 


It may be recalled that before issuing the warrants, the judge deposed two 
witnesses, namely, Nestor Labaria of the BIR, and Rodrigo Abos, who claimed to 
be an old employee of Unifish. Petitioners claim that the testimonies of Labaria 
and Abos are hearsay. We agree with this contention, but only as to the 
testimony of Labaria, who stated during the examination:








Q. 




Do you know of a certain Uy Chin Ho alias Frank Uy? 





A. 




No. 




Q. 




Do you know his establishment known as Unifish Packing 
Corporation? 




A. 




I have only heard of that thru the affidavit of our 
informer, Mr. Abos. 




Q. 




Why are you applying for search warrant in the premises of 
Unifish Packing Corporation? 




A.




Because of that information we received that they are 
using only delivery receipts instead of the legal sales invoices. It is highly 
indicative of fraud.




Q.




From where did you get that information? 




A. 




From our informer, the former employee of that 
establishment.
[29]


The above portion of the transcript shows that Labaria's knowledge of the 
alleged illegal activities of petitioners was acquired not through his own 
perception but was merely supplied by Abos. Therefore, the deposition of 
Labaria, which is based on hearsay, standing alone, cannot justify the issuance 
of the search warrants.
[30]
 


The application for the warrants, however, is not based solely on Labaria's 
deposition but is supported by that of Abos, whose knowledge of petitioners' 
alleged illegal practices was apparently obtained during his employment with 
Unifish. In his deposition, Abos detailed the schemes employed by Frank Uy and 
Unifish to evade the payment of taxes, and described the place where the 
documents supposedly evidencing these schemes were located:








Q 




Do you know Frank Uy? 




A




Yes. 




Q




Why do you know him? 




A 




Because I were (sic) an employee of his from 1980 until 
August of 1993.




Q




Where is this Unifish Packing Corporation located? 





A




Hernan Cortes St.




Q 




What is it being engaged of? 




A




It is engaged in canning of fish. 




Q 




You have executed an affidavit here to the effect that it 
seems that in his business dealings that he is actually doing something that 
perpetrated tax evasion. Is that correct?




A 




Yes. 




Q 




How is it done? 




A 




As an officer, he is an active member of the corporation who 
is at the same time making his authority as appointing himself as the 
distributor of the company's products. He sells these products thru supermarkets 
in Visayas and Mindanao, in fact, the whole Philippines. He makes it appear that 
it is the company which is selling when actually it is him selling the goods and 
he does not issue any invoices.




Q 


Since he does not issue any invoices, how is it done? 




A 


Thru delivery receipts. 




Q 


Is the delivery receipt official? 




A


No. It is unregistered. 




Q 


For how long has this been going on? 




A


As far as I know, it is still in 1986 since we started producing the 
sardines.




Q 


When was the last time that you observed that that is what he is doing? 





A


August, 1993, last month. 




Q


How did you happen to know about this last month?




A




Because he delivered to certain supermarkets and the payments 
of that supermarket did not go directly to the company. It went to him and he is 
the one who paid the company for the goods that he sold. 




Q 




Can you tell this Court the name of that certain 
supermarkets? 




A 




White Gold and Gaisano. 




Q




How did you know this fact? 




A 




As a manager of the company I have access to all the records 
of that company for the last three years. I was the Operating Chief. 





Q 




Until now? 




A 




No. I was separated already. 




Q




When? 




A




August, 1993. Q How does he do this manipulation? 





A




He sells the goods to the supermarkets afterwhich the 
company, Unifish will deliver to his customers, then his customers will pay 
directly to him and in turn, he pays to the company. 




Q


And these transactions, were they reflected in their books of account or 
ledger or whatever? 




A 


It is written but it is supposed to be a secret transaction. It is not for 
the public, not for the BIR but it is only for the purpose of keeping the 
transactions between the company and him. It is not made to be shown to the BIR. 





Q


In that books of account, is it reflected that they have made some 
deliveries to certain supermarkets? 




A 


Yes.




Q 


For the consumption of the BIR what are the papers that they show? . 





A


It is the private accounting firm that prepares everything. 




Q 


Based on what? 




A 


Based on some fictitious records just as they wish to declare. 




Q




In your affidavit you stated that there are sales invoices, 
official receipts, delivery receipts, sales records, etc. These documents are 
records that you have stated, in your affidavit, which are only for the 
consumption of the company? 




A 




Yes, not for the BIR




Q


Where are they kept now? 




A




They are kept on the table which I have drawn in the sketch. 
This is the bird's eyeview (sic) of the whole office. When you enter thru the 
door this Gina Tan is the one recording all the confidential transactions of the 
company. In this table you can find all the ledgers and 
notebooks.




Q 


This sketch is a blow-up of this portion, Exh. "A"? 




A 




Yes. Exh. "B" is the blow-up of Exh. "A" inside the office. 
In this blow-up there are four personnel plus one new personnel. Gina Tan 
collects all the records from this girl and this girl makes the statements. This 
first girl delivers the receipts. The second girl prepares the bill of lading. 
The third girl keeps the inventory of all the stocks. This sketch here is the 
bodega where the records are kept. The records from these people are stored in 
this place which is marked as "C".




Q 


So what you want to impress on that now is that only current records are 
kept by Gina because according to you the whole records are already placed in 
the bodega? 




A 


Yes. 




Q


But how can you enter the bodega? 




A 




Here, from the main entrance there is a door which will lead 
to this part here. If you go straight there is a bodega there and there is also 
a guard from this exit right after opening the door. 




Q 


The problem is that, when actually in August have you seen the current 
records kept by Gina? 




A 


I cannot exactly recall but I have the xerox copies of the records. 





Q 


Where are they now?




A


They are in my possession (witness handling [sic] to the Court a bunch of 
records).




Q




The transactions that are reflected in these xerox copies 
that you have given me, especially this one which seems to be pages of a ledger, 
they show that these are for the months of January, February, March, April and 
May. Are these transactions reflected in these xerox copies which appear in the 
ledger being shown to the BIR? 




A 


As far as I know, it did not appear.




Q 


What about this one which says Columnar Book Cash Receipt for the month of 
January, what does it show? 




A 


It shows that Frank Uy is the one purchasing from the company and these are 
his customers. 




Q


Do these entries appear in the columnar books which are the basis for the 
report to the BIR? 




A 


As far as I know, it does not reflect. 




Q 




What are these xerox copies of checks?




A




I think we cannot trace it up. These ones are the memos 
received by Unifish for payment of sardines. This is the statement of the 
company given to Uy Chin Ho for collection. 






Q 




It is also stated in your affidavit that the company imported 
soya oil. How is it done? 




A




The company imports soya oil to be used as a component in the 
processing of canned tuna for export. The company enjoys certain BOI privilege 
and so it is tax free. As far as I know, they profit more to dispose the product 
locally. Whatever excess of this soya oil are sold to another 
company.




Q




Is that fact reflected in the xerox copies? 




A




No. I have the actual delivery receipt. 




Q




In other words, the company imports soya oil supposedly to be 
used as a raw material but instead they are selling it locally? 




A




Yes. ([W]itness showing DR No. 3053 dated November 13, 1991.) 
This delivery receipt was the delivery receipt to Celebes Canning Corp. of the 
90 grams soya oil. 




Q




In other words, this soya oil should have to be used by Unifish but instead 
they are seeling (sic) it? 




A


Yes, at a profit. 




Q 


You also said that there is tax evasion in the selling of cans. What do you 
mean by this? 




A 




There is another privileged [sic] by the BOI for a special 
price given to packaging materials. When you export the product there is a 50% 
price difference. Now, taking that advantage of that exemption, they sold it to 
certain company here, again to Virginia Farms.




Q


Do you have proof to that effect? 




A


No, but we can get it there. 




Q 




Will that fact be shown in any listed articles in the 
application for search warrant since according to you, you have seen this 
manipulation reflected on the books of account kept by Gina? Are you sure that 
these documents are still there? 




A


Yes. I have received information. 




COURT: 


Alright.
[31]




Abos stated that, as former Operating Chief of Unifish, he had access to the 
company records, and even showed the issuing judge photocopies thereof. Thus, we 
reject the contention that this witness did not have personal knowledge of the 
facts to which he testified. The contents of the deposition clearly demonstrate 
otherwise.


The deposition also shows that, contrary to petitioners' submission, the 
inquiries made by the judge were far from leading or being a rehash of the 
witness' affidavit. We find such inquiries to be sufficiently probing.


Alleged lack of
particularity in the 
description of the
things 
seized


Petitioners note the similarities in the description of the things to be 
seized in the subject warrants and those in 
Stonehill vs. Diokno
,
[32]
 
Bache & Co. (Phil.), Inc. vs. 
Ruiz
,
[33]
 and 
Asian Surety & 
Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Herrera
.
[34]




In 
Stonehill
, the effects to be searched and seized were described as: 





"Books of accounts, financial records, vouchers, journals correspondence, 
receipts, ledgers, portfolios, credit journals, typewriters, and other documents 
and/or papers showing all business transactions including disbursement receipts, 
balance sheets and related profit and loss statements." 


This Court found that the foregoing description failed to conform to the 
requirements set forth by the Constitution since:




x x x the warrants authorized the search for and seizure of records 
pertaining to 
all business transactions
 of petitioners herein, regardless 
of whether the transactions were 
legal 
or 
illegal
. The warrants 
sanctioned the seizure of 
all 
records of the petitioners and the 
aforementioned corporations, whatever their nature, thus openly contravening the 
explicit command of our Bill of Rights - that the things to be seized be 

particularly 
described - as well as tending to defeat its major object: 
the elimination of 
general
 warrants.


In 
Bache & Co.
, this Court struck down a warrant containing a 
similar description as those in 
Stonehill
:




The documents, papers, and effects sought to be seized are described in 
Search Warrant No. 2-M-70 in this manner:


"Unregistered and private books of accounts (ledgers, journals, columnars, 
receipts and disbursements books, customers' ledgers); receipts for payments 
received; certificates of stocks and securities; contracts, promissory notes and 
deeds of sale; telex and coded messages; business communications; accounting and 
business records; checks and check stubs; records of bank deposits and 
withdrawals; and records of foreign remittances, covering the years 1966 to 
1970."


The description does not meet the requirement in Art. III, Sec. 1, of the 
Constitution, and of Sec. 3, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Court, that the 
warrant should particularly describe the things to be seized.


x x x




In Uy Kheytin, et al. vs. Villareal, etc., et al., 42 Phil. 886, 896, this 
Court had occasion to explain the purpose of the requirement that the warrant 
should particularly describe the place to be searched and the things to be 
seized, to wit: "x x x Both the Jones Law (sec. 3) and General Orders No. 68 
(sec. 97) specifically require that a search warrant should 
particularly 
describe
 the place to be searched and the things to be seized. The evident 
purpose and intent of this requirement is to limit the things to be seized to 
those, and only those, particularly described in the search warrant - to leave 
the officers of the law with no discretion regarding what articles they shall 
seize, to the end that `unreasonable searches and seizures' may not be made, - 
that abuses may not be committed. That is the correct interpretation of this 
constitutional provision borne out by the American authorities." 


The purpose as thus explained could, surely and effectively, be defeated 
under the search warrant issued in this case.


A search warrant may be said to particularly describe the things to be seized 
when the description therein is as specific as the circumstances will ordinarily 
allow (People vs. Rubio, 57 Phil, 384); or when the description expresses a 
conclusion of fact - not of law - by which the warrant officer may be guided in 
making the search and seizure (
idem
., dissent of Abad Santos, 

J
.,); or when the things described are limited to those which bear direct 
relation to the offense for which the warrant is being issued (Sec. 2, Rule 126, 
Revised Rules of Court). The herein search warrant does not conform to any of 
the foregoing tests. If the articles desired to be seized have any direct 
relation to an offense committed, the applicant must necessarily have some 
evidence, other than those articles, to prove the said offense; and the articles 
subject of search and seizure should come in handy merely to strengthen such 
evidence. In this event, the description contained in the herein disputed 
warrant should have mentioned, at least, the dates, amounts, persons, and other 
pertinent data regarding the receipts of payments, certificates of stocks and 
securities, contracts, promissory notes, deeds of sale, messages and 
communications, checks, bank deposits and withdrawals, records of foreign 
remittances, among others, enumerated in the warrant.


In 
Asian Surety & Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Herrera
, the description 
of the things to be seized, i.e., "Fire Registers, Loss, Bordereau, Adjusters' 
Report, including subrogation receipts and proof of loss, Loss Registers, Book 
of Accounts including cash receipts and disbursements and general ledger, etc." 
was held to be "an omnibus description" and, therefore, invalid:




x x x Because of this all embracing description which includes all 
conceivable records of petitioner corporation, which if seized x x x, could 
paralyze its business, petitioner in several motions filed for early resolution 
of this case, manifested that the seizure of TWO carloads of their papers has 
paralyzed their business to the grave prejudice of not only the company, its 
workers, agents, employees but also of its numerous insured and beneficiaries of 
bonds issued by it, including the government itself, and of the general public. 
And correlating the same to the charges for which the warrant was issued, We 
have before Us the infamous general warrants of old.


In the case at bar, the things to be seized were described in the following 
manner:


Multiple sets of Books of Accounts; Ledgers, Journals, Columnar Books, Cash 
Register Books, Sales Books or Records; Provisional & Official 
Receipts;


Production Record Books/Inventory Lists [,] Stock Cards;


Unregistered Delivery Receipts;


Unregistered Purchase & Sales Invoices;


Sales Records, Job Order;


Corporate Financial Records; and


Bank Statements/Cancelled Checks 


We agree that most of the items listed in the warrants fail to meet the test 
of particularity, especially since witness Abos had furnished the judge 
photocopies of the documents sought to be seized. The issuing judge could have 
formed a more specific description of these documents from said photocopies 
instead of merely employing a generic description thereof. The use of a generic 
term or a general description in a warrant is acceptable only when a more 
specific description of the things to be seized is unavailable. The failure to 
employ the specificity available will invalidate a general description in a 
warrant.
[35]
 The use by the issuing judge 
of the terms "multiple sets of books of accounts, ledgers, journals, columnar 
books, cash register books, sales books or records, provisional & official 
receipts," "production record books/inventory lists, stock cards," "sales 
records, job order," "corporate financial records," and "bank 
statements/cancelled checks" is therefore unacceptable considering the 
circumstances of this case.


As regards the terms "unregistered delivery receipts" and "unregistered 
purchase & sales invoices," however, we hold otherwise. The Solicitor 
General correctly argues that the serial markings of these documents need not be 
specified as it is not possible to do so precisely because they are 
unregistered.
[36]
 Where, by the nature of 
the goods to be seized, their description must be rather general, it is not 
required that a technical description be given, as this would mean that no 
warrant could issue. Taking into consideration the nature of the articles so 
described, it is clear that no other more adequate and detailed description 
could have been given, particularly because it is difficult to give a particular 
description of the contents thereof.
[37]
 
Although it appears that photocopies of these unregistered documents were among 
those handed by Abos to the issuing judge, it would be impractical to require 
the latter to specify each and every receipt and invoice, and the contents 
thereof, to the minutest detail.


The general description of most of the documents listed in the warrants does 
not render the entire warrant void. Insofar as the warrants authorize the search 
and seizure of unregistered delivery receipts and unregistered purchase and 
sales invoices, the warrants remain valid. The search warrant is severable, and 
those items not particularly described may be cut off without destroying the 
whole warrant. In 
United States v. Cook
,
[38]
 the United States Court of Appeals (Fifth 
Circuit) made the following pronouncement:




x x x. The leading decision is 
Aday v. Superior Court
, 53 Cal.2d 789, 
362 P.2d 47, 13 Cal.Rptr. 415 (1961). In 
Aday
, a warrant was issued 
authorizing the seizure of two particularly described books and myriad other 
generally described items. On appeal, the California Supreme Court held that 
only the books were particularly described in the warrant and lawfully seized. 
The court acknowledged that the warrant was flawed, but rather than suppress 
everything seized, the court chose to sever the defective portions of the 
warrant and suppress only those items that were not particularly described.




Although the warrant was defective x x x it does not follow that it was 
invalid as a whole. Such a conclusion would mean that the seizure of certain 
articles, even though proper if viewed separately, must be condemned merely 
because the warrant was defective with respect to other articles. The invalid 
portions of the warrant are severable from the authorization relating to the 
named books x x x. 


The search for and seizure of these books, if otherwise valid, were not 
rendered illegal by the defects concerning other 
articles.


x x x




x x x We agree with the reasoning of the Supreme Court of California and the 
majority of state courts that have considered this question and hold that in the 
usual case the district judge should sever the infirm portion of the search 
warrant as passes constitutional muster. 
See United States v. Giresi
, 488 
F.Supp. 445, 459-60 (D.N.J.1980). Items that were not described with the 
requisite particularity in the warrant should be suppressed, but suppression of 
all of the fruits of the search is hardly consistent with the purposes 
underlying exclusion. Suppression of only the items improperly described 
prohibits the Government from profiting from its own wrong and removes the court 
from considering illegally obtained evidence. Moreover, suppression of only 
those items that were not particularly described serves as an effective 
deterrent to those in the Government who would be tempted to secure a warrant 
without the necessary description. As the leading commentator has observed, "it 
would be harsh medicine indeed if a warrant which was issued on probable cause 
and which did particularly describe certain items were to be invalidated in toto 
merely because the affiant and the magistrate erred in seeking and permitting a 
search for other items as well." 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on 
the Fourth Amendment Â§4.6(f) (1978).


Accordingly, the items not particularly described in the warrants ought to be 
returned to petitioners.


Petitioners allege that the following articles, though not listed in the 
warrants, were also taken by the enforcing officers:


One (1) composition notebook containing Chinese characters,"


Two (2) pages writing with Chinese characters,


Two (2) pages Chinese character writing,


Two (2) packs of chemicals,


One (1) bound gate pass,


Surety Agreement.
[39]
 


In addition, the searching party also seized items belonging to the Premier 
Industrial and Development Corporation (PIDC), which shares an office with 
petitioner Unifish.


The things belonging to petitioner not specifically mentioned in the 
warrants, like those not particularly described, must be ordered returned to 
petitioners. In order to comply with the constitutional provisions regulating 
the issuance of search warrants, the property to be seized under a warrant must 
be particularly described therein and no other property can be taken 
thereunder.
[40]
 In 
Tambasen vs. 
People
,
[41]
 it was held:




Moreover, by their seizure of articles not described in the search warrant, 
the police acted beyond the parameters of their authority under the search 
warrant. Section 2, Article III of the 1987 Constitution requires that a search 
warrant should particularly describe the things to be seized. "The evident 
purpose and intent of the requirement is to limit the things to be seized to 
those, and only those, particularly described in the search warrant, to leave 
the officers of the law with no discretion regarding what articles they should 
seize, to the end that unreasonable searches and seizures may not be made and 
that abuses may not be committed" (Corro v. Lising, 137 SCRA 541, 547 [1985]); 
Bache & Co. [Phil.], Inc. v. Ruiz, 37 SCRA 823 [1971]; Uy Kheytin v. 
Villareal, 42 Phil. 886 [1920]). The same constitutional provision is also aimed 
at preventing violations of security in person and property and unlawful 
invasions of the sanctity of the home, and giving remedy against such 
usurpations when attempted (People v. Damaso, 212 SCRA 547 [1992] citing Alvero 
v. Dizon, 76 Phil. 637, 646 [1946]).


Clearly then, the money which was not indicated in the search warrant, had 
been illegally seized from petitioner. The fact that the members of the police 
team were doing their task of pursuing subversives is not a valid excuse for the 
illegal seizure. The presumption 
juris tantum
 of regularity in the 
performance of official duty cannot by itself prevail against the 
constitutionally protected right of an individual (People v. Cruz, 231 SCRA 759 
[1994]; People v. Veloso, 48 Phil. 169, 176 [1925]). Although public welfare is 
the foundation of the power to search and seize, such power must be exercised 
and the law enforced without transgressing the constitutional rights of the 
citizens (People v. Damaso, 
supra
, citing Rodriguez v. Evangelista, 65 
Phil. 230, 235 [1937]). As the Court aptly puts it in 
Bagahilog v. 
Fernandez
, 198 SCRA 614 (1991), "[z]eal in the pursuit of criminals cannot 
ennoble the use of arbitrary methods that the Constitution itself 
abhors."


The seizure of the items not specified in the warrants cannot be justified by 
the directive in the penultimate paragraph thereof to "seize and take possession 
of other properties relative to such violation," which in no way can be 
characterized as a particular description of the things to be seized.


As regards the articles supposedly belonging to PIDC, we cannot order their 
return in the present proceedings. The legality of a seizure can be contested 
only by the party whose rights have been impaired thereby, and the objection to 
an unlawful search and seizure is purely personal and cannot be availed of by 
third parties.
