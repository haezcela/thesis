PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROLANDO SANTOS Y GARCIA ALSO KNOWN AS OLE, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




BELLOSILLO, J.:


ROLANDO SANTOS Y GARCIA also known as 
Ole
 was charged 
with rape under Art. 335, par. (3), of 
The Revised Penal Code
 in a 
Complaint filed with the Regional Trial Court of Manila alleging that on or 
about 10 May 1992 the accused by means of force or intimidation succeeded in 
having carnal knowledge of Cindy de la Cruz, a minor eight (8) years of age, 
against her will and consent.
[1]


Cindy de la Cruz was born on 21 November 1983 to Ricardo and 
Myrna de la Cruz. At the time Cindy was allegedly sexually abused, she was only 
eight (8) years, five (5) months and nineteen (19) days old.


On 10 May 1992, at around noon, Cindy was watching television 
at the ground floor of their house together with the accused. Unexpectedly, 
Rolando casually lifted Cindy and brought her to the bathroom upstairs. Once 
inside the bathroom he undressed her and touched her private parts as the 
innocent girl lay helplessly on the floor. Unsatiated yet he placed himself on 
top of her, covered her mouth with his hand, inserted his sex organ into hers 
and started to pump into her in "horselike" fashion. Cindy felt pain but as her 
mouth was covered she found it difficult to scream for help. Only a knock on the 
bathroom door by Cindy's older sister interrupted Rolando's sexual assault. He 
hurriedly put on his clothes; she followed suit. As soon as Cindy came out of 
the bathroom, she went straight to the house of her aunt, Norma Nepomuceno, to 
report her traumatic experience. She narrated how the accused molested her not 
only that afternoon but several instances in the past. According to Cindy, she 
had long wanted to report the accused to her parents but was intimidated by his 
bulging eyes
[2]
 and penetrating looks. 
Norma wasted no time in informing Cindy's parents, who had just arrived from the 
Antipolo church, of the anguish that their daughter had suffered. Forthwith, her 
parents accompanied Cindy to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and were 
advised to take her to the Medico Legal Officer for a physical and genital 
examination.
[3]


Dr. Marcial CeÃ±ido testified that he examined Cindy de la Cruz 
upon request of the General Assignment Division of the Western Police District 
(WPD) and his findings were: (a) hymen was circular in shape, thick and intact, 
and (b) there was marked reddening of the hyper-hymenal tissue.
[4]
 Dr. CeÃ±ido explained that the reddening 
could have been the result of some traumatic condition like pressure of an 
object, possibly a penis or a finger, upon the opening of the genitalia. On 
cross-examination, the defense would elicit from the medico-legal officer that 
his findings indicated no prior sexual intercourse on the part of Cindy. But Dr. 
CeÃ±ido was quick to add that the term sexual intercourse ordinarily meant 
complete penetration, and it would only be in this context that Cindy could not 
have had sexual intercourse.
[5]
 


The accused denied having raped Cindy de la Cruz. His being 
charged of this serious crime could only be attributed to the vengeful motive of 
her mother, Myrna de la Cruz. He narrated that sometime in March 1992 she caught 
her husband embracing him in their bedroom so she hurled invectives at him 
prompting him to run away.


On cross-examination, the accused further testified that the de 
la Cruz spouses were engaged in the hog business and he was employed by them as 
a hog scaler. Whenever the shipment of hogs would arrive, he would weigh them 
before being" paid for by Myrna. In this job he was able to gain the trust of 
the couple such that he was allowed to stay freely with the family.


The accused informed the court that Myrna de la Cruz also filed 
a similar complaint for rape against a neighbor, Michael Centeno, with Cindy's 
older sister as the alleged victim. But the prosecution replied that in fact 
there was already issued a warrant for the arrest of Michael. The accused in an 
obvious effort to discredit Myrna de la Cruz testified that she even offered to 
settle the case against him for P200,000.00.
[6]
 


Of course, Myrna de la Cruz vehemently denied the unholy 
imputations against her by the accused. She assured the court when she testified 
in 1993 that her husband could not be the homosexual that Rolando portrayed him 
to be as they had been engaged for six (6) years before they got married, and 
they were married seventeen (17) years ago, producing four (4) children as a 
result of their marriage. Myrna denied categorically having asked money from the 
accused and asserted, on the other hand, that it was the family of the accused 
that went to their house a number of times offering money in exchange for their 
withdrawal of the charges.
[7]


The trial court convicted the accused of rape under Art. 335, 
par. (3) of 
The Revised Penal Code
 as amended and sentenced him to 

reclusion perpetua. 
The Decision relied mainly on the testimony of the 
victim which the court considered clear and unobtuse, in contrast with that of 
the accused which it described as erratic and evasive.
[8]
 


In his brief, accused-appellant assails the credibility of 
Cindy de la Cruz particularly with respect to her claim that she had been raped 
five (5), ten (10) or twenty (20) times. The thrust of his argument is that if 
the tale of the several rapes was true, Cindy's hymen would not have remained 
thin and intact. More importantly, he claimed that the canard narrated by Cindy 
would also strongly contradict the finding of the doctor that she had no prior 
sexual experience.
[9]
 


We find no merit in the contention of accused-appellant. Dr. 
CeÃ±ido thoroughly discussed these intriguing hymenal qualities, but 
accused-appellant would, understandably so, pretend to find the whole concept as 
obscure. He said that, as a general rule, a hymen that is intact would negate 
prior sexual intercourse but that the rule was not absolute as penetration can 
happen with or without rupturing the hymen. He confirmed that there were women 
whose hymens remained intact even after giving birth owing to the fact that 
their hymens must be very elastic. But in the case of Cindy, Dr. CeÃ±edo said 
that no further examination was done to determine the elasticity of her hymen, 
for to do so might only cause injury and prove counter-productive considering 
that it was still intact.
[10]
 


The doctor's conclusions do not establish a novice medical nor 
legal theory. Our jurisprudence is replete with cases which would easily lay 
waste any attempt by accused-appellant to dent the credibility of the victim. 
The fact that there was no deep penetration of the victim's vagina and that her 
hymen was still intact does not negate the commission of rape. Rape can be 
consummated even with the slightest penetration. It is enough that there is 
proof of entrance of the male organ into the labia or pudendum of the female 
organ,
[11]
 or a penetration, however 
slight of the external genitalia.
[12]




Accused-appellant would magnify the significance of Cindy's 
failure to state with accuracy the number of times she had been raped.
[13]
 But these perceived discrepancies are 
inconsequential. Inconsistencies of this nature can be expected of a young girl 
whose harrowing experience she is called upon to recall. They tend to buttress, 
rather than weaken, her credibility since they indicate that her testimony was 
not contrived. On this point, the trial court supplied us with sufficient 
explanation
[14]
-




Neither is her affirmative reply, when asked if she was raped 
by the accused, more than five, more than ten or more than twenty times with 
penile penetration, yet with her hymen remaining intact after all those 
incidents, even if not considered true at all twenty times, would altogether 
cast doubt as to the truthfulness of her narration in open court as similarly 
reflected in her sworn affidavit that indeed accused sexually molested her on 
May 10, 1992, the date which she vividly remembers. The questions were not only 
cunningly framed as to naturally incite the young girl in answering in the 
affirmative, but are also provocative, suggesting and fishing from her an answer 
which necessarily would not depart from her unforgettable experience x x x 



Accused-appellant also finds it unfathomable that when Cindy 
opened the door for her sister, it was at once an opportunity for her to report 
the matter but Cindy did not. The argument fails to persuade us. Why Cindy 
failed to find an ally in her sister at that precise moment can only admit an 
obvious explanation, 
i.e.,
 Rolando intimidated her into silence that she 
had altogether dismissed the idea of informing her sister, at least while in the 
presence of her tormentor. The next best thing to do was to get as far away as 
possible from her attacker and report the outrage to an adult, in this case, her 
aunt, equipped with the wisdom and equanimity demanded by the circumstances.


Accused-appellant argues that if indeed Cindy was raped inside 
the bathroom, then her sister should have at least noticed something unusual 
when she saw Cindy. But this argument overlooks the fact that Cindy had just 
been abused and was certainly still in shock. It is not proper to judge the 
actions of children who have undergone traumatic experiences by the norms of 
behavior expected under the circumstances from mature persons.
[15]
 Cindy was too traumatized to project any 
noticeable emotion. Fear would oftentimes overwhelm the victim or stupefy her 
into inaction.
[16]


Furthermore, both parties admitted that accused-appellant 
enjoyed some degree of confidence and trust from the de la Cruz family that 
allowed him to stay in their home as he pleased. It then did not probably seem 
strange to Cindy's sister that accused-appellant and the victim were locked up 
in the bathroom since anyway, the door was opened as soon as she knocked on it. 
Besides, it may be that Cindy's sister was herself preoccupied with whatever 
business she intended to do inside the bathroom that she failed to notice that 
there was something wrong with Cindy.


Accused-appelllant also faults the victim for keeping silent 
throughout the twenty (20) or so times that she was raped considering that he 
was not always beside her to make good his alleged threats. But her vacillation 
was justified and should not diminish the veracity of her accusation. Although 
accused-appellant was not always within her sight, the grim memory of his 
bestiality constantly lurked in her mind. Although a man lays no hand on a 
woman, if by an array of physical forces he overpowers her mind that she does 
not resist, or she ceases resistance through fear of a greater harm, the 
consummation of the sexual act is recognized in jurisprudence as rape.
[17]


Finally, accused-appellant's assertion that the homosexual 
affair between him and Myrna's husband had incited her to accuse Rolando of rape 
borders on depravity and despair. For even if gender was dubious, it was highly 
improbable that the controversy would provoke Myrna to go to court and forever 
corrupt the chastity of her own daughter. She has not been proved to be insane 
or unfit as a mother to forever tarnish the innocence of her daughter if only to 
seek requital for a wrong supposedly committed by her husband and the accused. 
To correlate the discovery of the supposed homosexual affair between him and 
Ricardo with Myrna's impure motives betrays a devious mind churning warped 
logic. If indeed as accused related that Myrna discovered her husband embracing 
him while he was asleep, why then did she not vent her ire on her husband 
instead; after all accused was sleeping and was unaware of Ricardo's lascivious 
conduct. The only conceivable reason then for her filing the charge of rape was 
to seek justice for Cindy and let Rolando's conviction mitigate her pain and the 
agony of her child.


In a last ditch effort to extricate himself, the accused 
laments that if the alleged homosexual affair did not impel Myrna to file the 
case, her husband's failure to rebut this in court has weakened their 
position.


We disagree. Rebuttal evidence is that which is given to 
explain, repel, counteract or disprove facts given in evidence by the adverse 
party. It is also defined as evidence in denial of some affirmative fact which 
the adverse party has attempted to prove. Myrna as the mother of the victim and 
wife of Ricardo was properly called to the witness stand to rebut all damaging 
insinuations pertaining to Rolando's homosexuality. The issue is not really on 
the gender of her husband but whether its probable implications are sufficient 
for her to withstand the rigors of public trial, perjure herself and subject her 
own daughter and her whole family to distress and public humiliation. By 
testifying in rebuttal, Myrna is in effect commenting that the homosexual 
affair, whether true or imagined, was not the real basis for the filing of the 
rape charge. Even more apparent is that whatever rebuttal statement could have 
been evoked from Ricardo would merely be corroborative since Myrna had said and 
denied in her rebuttal all that was necessary to turn this case in their 
favor.


Accused-appellant's defense hinges primarily on denial. This is 
inherently a weak defense and cannot prevail over the positive identification of 
the complainant. Cindy knew and trusted Rolando since he was considered part of 
her family. She positively identified him as the person who raped her that May 
afternoon.


The rape took place on 10 May 1992, which was before the 
effectivity of RA 7659. Hence, the pertinent provisions of 
The Revised Penal 
Code
 shall apply -




Art. 335. 
When and how rape is committed.
 - Rape is 
committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following 
circumstances: (1) By using force or intimidation; (2) When a woman is deprived 
of reason or is otherwise unconscious; and, (3) When the woman is under twelve 
years of age, even though neither of the circumstances mentioned in the two next 
preceding paragraphs shall be present x x x x The crime of rape shall be 
punished by 
reclusion perpetua

Art. 335. The 
Revised Penal Code. - RA 8353 "The Anti-Rape Law of 1997," approved on 30 
September 1997, has classified rape as a crime against persons. It mandated the 
incorporation of Chapter Three on Rape into Title Eight of the Revised Penal 
Code. Thus, the crime of rape is now governed by Arts. 266-A, 266-B, 266-C and 
266-D.
