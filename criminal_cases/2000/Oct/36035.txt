QUISUMBING, J.:


This is an appeal from the decision
[1]
 
rendered on March 17, 1994, by the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo City, Branch 
25, in Criminal Case No. 35146, finding accused-appellants Alex Bantillo and 
Ernesto Asuncion guilty of murder.


On August 31, 1990, Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Arsenio Villa charged 
Alex Bantillo, Ernesto Asuncion, Larry Asuncion, Rodolfo Atanas, Paquito 
Fernandez and Anoring Badando with the crime of murder, allegedly committed as 
follows: 




"That on or about the 6th day of March, 1990, in the Municipality of Carles, 
Province of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping 
one another to better realize their purpose, with deliberate intent and decided 
purpose to kill, armed with unlicensed firearms (
pugakhang
), with 
treachery and evident premeditation and without any justifiable cause or motive, 
did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and 
shoot one FRANCISCO TEMBLOR with the firearms they were then provided, 
inflicting upon their said victim multiple gunshot wounds on the head and on the 
different parts of his body, which caused the instantaneous death of said 
Francisco Temblor.


CONTRARY TO LAW."
[2]


Upon arraignment, Alex Bantillo and Ernesto Asuncion, assisted by counsel, 
entered a plea of not guilty.
[3]
 
Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued. Subsequently, the trial court rendered 
judgment, disposing as follows:




"WHEREFORE, premises considered, there being a plethora of proof showing that 
accused Ernesto Asuncion and Alex Bantillo are guilty beyond any shadow of doubt 
of the crime of Murder as charged, with the qualifying circumstance of treachery 
and aggravating circumstances of superiority of force and band, and without any 
mitigating circumstance, said accused are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty 
of Reclusion Perpetua with the accessory penalties as provided in Article 41 of 
the Revised Penal Code and they are also ordered to indemnify the family of the 
victim the sum of P50,000.00 as well as the amounts of P30,000.00 and P20,000.00 
as moral and exemplary damages, respectively, and to pay the costs.


SO ORDERED."
[4]


The factual antecedents of this case as culled from the records are as 
follows:


Ruel Temblor (Ruel), the son of the victim, testified that at about 7:30 in 
the morning of March 6, 1990, he accompanied his father, the deceased Francisco 
Temblor, to cut coconut lumber in Barangay Batuanan, Carles, Iloilo, two 
kilometers away from their residence. They walked along the seashore near an 
ascending and rocky portion where there were coconut trees and bushes. He was 
ahead of his father, by about 30 meters. While walking, Ruel heard gunfire and, 
as he looked back, he saw his father fall to the ground. He then saw six 
persons, all carrying long homemade firearms known as "
pugakhang
", rush 
and surround his father. He witnessed Alex Bantillo shoot his father on the 
head. Thereafter, all the assailants ran towards the hills and vanished. Ruel 
then proceeded to Barangay Barangcalan to seek the help of their employer, Eric 
Lacson. But upon finding that Lacson was not there, he went home and informed 
his mother (Celedonia) what happened to his father. Together with four male 
companions, Ruel immediately returned to the scene of the crime to attend to his 
dead father until a doctor and policemen arrived. He said that his family 
incurred expenses in the amount of P20,000.00 for the wake and funeral of his 
father.
[5]
 


Ruel positively identified the appellants in open court. He testified that he 
personally knew the six perpetrators because all used to reside in the same 
barangay. He added that Ernesto Asuncion is his first cousin while Larry 
Asuncion is Ernesto's son. He opined that Ernesto Asuncion had a grudge against 
his father, that is why they killed him. He stated that Ernesto Asuncion lost as 
barangay captain because his father supported another candidate in the person of 
Romerico (Mariano) Asuncion.
[6]


Ruel's testimony was corroborated in its material points by another 
eyewitness, Alfredo Bandojo. Bandojo declared that at about 7:30 in the morning 
of March 6, 1990, he went to Barangcalan aboard a pumpboat to get coconut lumber 
stocked along the seashore. As they moored their pumpboat along the beach at the 
tip of Batuanan, he saw Ruel walking along the seashore followed by his father. 
Suddenly, he heard a series of explosions and saw the six accused persons, 
coming out of the bushes and coconut trees carrying long homemade firearms. The 
assailants descended to where the victim fell and then Alex Bantillo shot the 
victim on the head and thereafter the perpetrators went away.
[7]
 


Dr. Judy Ann Trumpeta testified that she conducted the 
post-mortem 

examination of the victim's body. She found that it bore fifteen gunshot 
wounds. Significantly, she found Francisco's frontal bone as well as his left 
and right parietal bones exploded, exposing the victim's brain. As there were 
powder burns on the wounds, she opined that some shots were fired at close range 
probably less than three meters. She declared that the cause of the victim's 
death is cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to hypovolemic shock secondary to 
multiple gunshot wounds.
[8]


The incident was reported to the Carles, Iloilo police. They conducted an 
investigation but failed to apprehend any suspect. Two days after the incident, 
Ruel went to the police station and gave the names of the suspects except the 
name of Ernesto Asuncion.
[9]
 


Of the six perpetrators, only Alex Bantillo and Ernesto Asuncion were 
apprehended and tried. The others still remain at large. Therefore, this case 
concerns only these two appellants.


For his defense, Alex Bantillo denied shooting Francisco. He claimed that he 
was in Barangay Manlot digging white clay at the time of the incident; that he 
had no reason to kill the victim as he has no grudge against him; that it was 
Eric Lacson who implicated him in the crime because the latter resented his 
joining the Free Farmers Federation and not supporting Lacson's candidacy during 
the barangay elections.
[10]
 


Ernesto Asuncion denied taking part in the crime. He corroborated the alibi 
of his co-accused Bantillo. He insisted that he was in Manlot supervising the 
dyeing of clay starting at four o' clock in the morning on the day the incident 
took place. He said he too had no reason to kill the victim. Nonetheless, he 
agreed that Batuanan was accessible to Manlot by pumpboat in less than an hour 
or in one hour and a half at most. 
[11]




The defense presented three other witnesses. First, Rolando Saturnino 
declared that Alex Bantillo, Ernesto Asuncion and Larry Asuncion were indeed 
working in Manlot at the time the victim was killed.
[12]
 Second, Romerico Asuncion, who was the 
incumbent barangay captain of Batuanan, stated that at about 7:00 o' clock in 
the morning he was along the seashore of Batuanan waiting for a pumpboat when 
Celedonia and Ruel, wife and son respectively of the victim, told him that 
Francisco was killed but they did not know the perpetrators. He also said that 
his brother, Ernesto Asuncion, was in Manlot at the time of the incident because 
the latter resided there.
[13]
 Third, 
Eduardo Casibual disputed Ruel's eyewitness testimony. He declared that he was 
at the house of the victim when a boy arrived and told Celedonia and Ruel that 
Francisco was killed. He added, mother and son rushed to the beach where the 
incident took place.
[14]
 


The trial court found the version of the defense unworthy of credence. It 
ruled that the denial and alibi put up by the defense is unavailing in the light 
of the positive and convincing identification of the appellants as the authors 
of the crime. Considering the evidence presented by the prosecution and the 
defense, the court found appellants guilty as charged. Insisting on their 
innocence, appellants promptly filed their notice of appeal.
[15]
 In their bid to obtain reversal of their 
conviction, appellants now raise the following errors allegedly committed by the 
trial court: 




"1. THE HONORABLE LOWER COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL CREDENCE TO THE 
TESTIMONIES OF PROSECUTION WITNESS RUEL TEMBLOR AND ALFREDO BANDOJO, THAT:




a. THEY ACTUALLY SAW THE KILLING AS NOTHING IMPAIR OR OBSTRUCT (sic) THEIR 
VIEW OF THE CRIME BEING COMMITTED AT ABOUT 7:00 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING;


b. BOTH ACTUALLY SAW ALEX BANTILLO SHOT FRANCISCO TEMBLOR IN THE 
HEAD.


2. THE HONORABLE LOWER COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY 
OF RUEL TEMBLOR THAT HIS FATHER WAS KILLED BECAUSE HIS FATHER HELPED ROMERICO 
ASUNCION INSTEAD OF ERNESTO ASUNCION IN THE LAST BARANGAY ELECTION.


3. THE HONORABLE LOWER COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY 
OF RUEL TEMBLOR THAT HE DID NOT REPORT TO BARANGAY CAPTAIN ROMERICO ASUNCION THE 
INCIDENT BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER IN GOOD TERMS.


4. THE HONORABLE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCIDENT NO MENTION WAS MADE WHO KILLED FRANCISCO TEMBLOR 
OR WHO WERE THE PERPETRATORS.


5. THE HONORABLE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING WEIGHT TO THE TESTIMONY OF 
ROMERICO ASUNCION THAT WHEN RUEL TEMBLOR AND HIS MOTHER CALLED FOR HIM, THEY DID 
NOT MENTION ANYBODY WHO SHOT FRANCISCO TEMBLOR.


6. THE HONORABLE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING FULL CREDENCE TO THE 
TESTIMONY OF EDUARDO CASIBUAL THAT RUEL TEMBLOR AND HIS MOTHER WAS (sic) AT 
THEIR HOUSE WHEN SOMEBODY INFORMED THEM ABOUT THE DEATH OF FRANCISCO 
TEMBLOR.


7. THE HONORABLE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE DEFENSE OF 
ALIBI OF THE ACCUSED.


8. THE HONORABLE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING ALL THE ACCUSED."
[16]


Notwithstanding the formulation of eight issues by appellants, in our view, 
the fundamental issue to be resolved is whether or not the trial court erred in 
affording credence to prosecution's evidence. We shall also consider the weight 
and credibility of appellants' defense.


In this case, prosecution witnesses Ruel Temblor and Alfredo Bandojo both 
claim seeing appellants surround Francisco after the latter was shot. They claim 
that as the victim lay on the ground, Alex Bantillo shot him on the head. 
Appellants deny the charges against them. They aver that they were somewhere 
else at the time of the incident. Moreover, appellants insist that Ruel could 
not have witnessed the killing as he was in his house at the time of the 
incident. He was seen by Eduardo Casibual there. In any case, appellants argue, 
Ruel should have been killed too if indeed he was with his father because the 
assailants would not spare a witness to tell the tale. As regards Bandojo, 
appellants simply characterized him as "all-seeing witness", thus, 
unbelievable.
[17]
 


On this issue, this Court has almost invariably ruled that the assessment of 
the credibility of witnesses is left largely to the trial court because of its 
opportunity, unavailable to the appellate court, to see the witnesses on the 
witness stand and determine by their conduct and demeanor whether they are 
testifying truthfully and objectively. The determination of credibility is the 
domain of the trial court, and the matter of assigning values to the testimonies 
of the witnesses is best performed by it. Thus, unless significant circumstances 
have been missed or omitted, the evaluation by the trial judge of the 
credibility of witnesses is well-nigh conclusive on the Court.
[18]
 Additionally, we have consistently ruled 
that when there are conflicting versions of the prosecution and the defense, as 
in this case, the findings of the trial court are generally entitled to great 
weight.
[19]


Reviewing the evidence of the prosecution and of the defense, we see no 
reason to doubt the testimony of the prosecution witnesses. Ruel and Bandojo 
knew appellants personally for a long time. Both positively identified 
appellants. Their view of the incident was unobstructed, and they witnessed the 
incident directly. Their distance from the crime scene was only a few meters. 
And it happened at around 7:00 o'clock in the morning. Fourth, they had no 
ill-motive to falsely implicate the appellants.


Appellants insist that Ruel could not be an eyewitness as he was seen in his 
house at the time of the incident. Suffice it to state that between the positive 
testimony of a witness and negative testimony of another, the former prevails. 
Ruel Temblor's testimony that he was at the scene of the crime when the incident 
happened prevails over the declaration he was not there. Moreover, we note that 
Ruel's version is corroborated by Bandojo. This adds credence to the 
prosecution's story. Regarding the defense argument that Ruel should have been 
killed too if indeed he was at the scene of the shooting, the same is highly 
speculative if not fallacious, to say the least.


In any case, Bandojo's testimony deserves full credence. Other than branding 
Bandojo as "all-seeing witness," appellants miserably failed to impeach his 
clear testimony. Under rigorous cross-examination, Bandojo remained steadfast in 
his assertion that appellants perpetrated the crime. Additionally, there is 
nothing to indicate that Bandojo was moved by dubious or improper motives to 
testify falsely against appellants, thus, his testimony is worthy of belief.
[20]
 In our view, Bandojo's testimony alone 
would be enough to convict appellants. Taken in conjunction with Ruel's, said 
testimony seals their fate.


Noteworthy, testimonies of the defense witnesses, which were intended to 
bolster the appellants' alibi, are far from convincing. They do not bear the 
earmarks of truth. As noted by the trial court, witness Eduardo Casibual stated 
that when he accidentally met for the first time the wife of Ernesto in 
Estancia, Iloilo, in August 1990, she asked him to testify for her husband. They 
had not known each other before that.
[21]
 
Yet, prior to that meeting, Casibual insisted that he never met with relatives 
of the appellants.
[22]
 How then did she 
know that Casibual saw the shooting incident so as to qualify as a witness 
thereon? The trial court noted that Casibual had conferred with the appellants 
and the defense lawyer about his testimony on the day of the hearing on January 
28, 1993.
[23]
 There is another 
contradiction in Casibual's testimony. Casibual first declared that he had never 
gone to the victim's house until the day the crime occurred, yet he later 
admitted that he went to the house of the deceased thrice before to have his 
boat repaired.
[24]
 That his testimony 
could have been contrived or tailored for the defense lessens its value and 
credibility.


The testimony of Romerico Asuncion deserves less weight. In his direct 
examination, he declared that he was in the beach waiting for a boat to 
Estancia, Iloilo, when Celedonia and Ruel told him of Francisco's death. But, 
during the cross-examination, he stated that he was near his house when mother 
and son told him about the killing.
[25]
 
Furthermore, it is improbable that the Temblors would seek Romerico Asuncion's 
help when they had a grudge against each other.


Next, appellant Ernesto Asuncion argues that he could not have killed 
Francisco just because the latter supported another candidate in the barangay 
elections. He avers that the motive ascribed to him is too flimsy. On this 
point, it must be stressed that motive is a state of one's mind which others 
cannot discern. It is not an element of the crime, and so it does not have to be 
proved.
[26]
 In fact, lack of motive for 
committing a crime does not preclude conviction. It is judicial knowledge that 
persons have been killed or assaulted for no reason at all.
[27]
 


Appellants also assail the credibility of the testimony of Ruel because 
allegedly he did not report the crime to the barangay officials of Batuanan, but 
informed his employer about the incident ahead of his own mother. Even if these 
were true, they do not destroy the value of his testimony. There is no standard 
behavioral response when one is confronted by a frightful event. Some may be 
shocked into insensibility while others react irrationally. The general rule is 
that witnesses react to a crime in different ways.
[28]
 As explained by Ruel during his 
cross-examination, their relationship with the barangay authorities of Batuanan 
is not good and so he did not report the incident immediately to them.
[29]
 Nonetheless Romerico Asuncion, then the 
barangay chief, admitted that Ruel and Celedonia informed him of Francisco's 
death soon after it happened.
[30]
 Ruel 
also stated that he proceeded to his employer first because he intended to seek 
help in transporting the body of his father.
[31]
 As observed by the Solicitor General, 
Ruel's employer was in better position to render assistance on the matter, while 
his mother would almost be shocked and paralyzed into inaction by the news of 
her husband's death.


What about the alibi of the appellants? For their alibi to prosper it is not 
enough to prove that the appellants were somewhere else when the offense was 
committed, but it must likewise be demonstrated that they were so far away that 
they could not have been physically present at the place of the crime or its 
immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.
[32]
 As earlier mentioned, appellants insisted 
that they were in Manlot working at the time of the incident. Even if true, this 
does not preclude their being present at the scene of the crime which is 
accessible by pumpboat. As admitted by appellant Ernesto Asuncion, from Manlot 
one can reach Batuanan in one hour to one hour and a half by pumpboat. Moreover, 
the alibi presented by the defense crumbles in the face of the positive 
identification of the appellants as the perpetrators of the crime.
[33]
 


We likewise agree with the trial court that treachery attended the killing of 
Francisco. The appellants waited in ambush behind the coconut trees and bushes, 
and suddenly unleashed volleys of gunfire at the unsuspecting victim. The sudden 
and unexpected attack and the deliberate manner the attack was carried out is 
undoubtedly treacherous.
[34]
 The number 
and location of wounds inflicted upon the victim attest to this treachery. The 
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses that after the victim had fallen to the 
ground, the assailants surrounded then shot him again are supported by the 
medical findings that some wounds have powder burns, indicating the close 
distance when the victim was fired at.


However, the trial court erred in separately taking into account the 
aggravating circumstances of band and superior strength. Treachery absorbs both 
aggravating circumstances. Both refer essentially to the use of the combined 
strength of the assailants to overpower the victim and consummate the 
killing
[35]
 


As to moral damages in the amount of P30,000.00, the trial court's award 
should be upheld. Under Article 2219 (1) of the Civil Code, moral damages may be 
recovered in a criminal offense resulting in physical injuries. In their generic 
sense, "physical injuries" includes death. Moral damages compensate for the 
mental anguish, serious anxiety and moral shock suffered by the victim and his 
family as the proximate result of the wrongful act. They are recoverable where a 
criminal offense results in physical injuries which culminate in the death of 
the victim. No proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in order that such damages 
may be adjudicated, and assessment thereof is left to the discretion of the 
court.
[36]
 


For the public's edification, exemplary damages are awarded, particularly in 
criminal cases where one or more aggravating circumstances attended the 
offense.
[37]
 In this case, home-made 
firearms (
pugakhang
) were used to perpetrate the killing. Although we 
find no generic aggravating circumstance to justify exemplary damages in the 
amount of P20,000.00 awarded by the trial court, in this case such award is 
justified to impress on the public the state's abhorrence to the proliferation 
of firearms. 


The heirs of the victim are also entitled to recover P20,000.00 for the 
amount they spent for the wake and funeral expenses of the deceased as found by 
the trial court. Accordingly, actual damages of P20,000.00 are properly awarded 
to the heirs of the victim. 


WHEREFORE
, the decision rendered on March 17, 1994, by the Regional 
Trial Court of Iloilo City, Branch 25, in Criminal Case No. 35146, finding 
appellants Alex Bantillo and Ernesto Asuncion

P30,000.00 as moral damages, and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages. Costs against
