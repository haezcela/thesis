ROBERTO FERNANDEZ, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.
DECISION




GONZAGA-REYES, J.:


In this petition for review on 
certiorari
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, Roberto Fernandez seeks to set aside the Decision of the Court of Appeals
[1]
  dated December 24, 1998 in CA-G.R. CR No. 18830 which affirmed in 
toto
 the Decision
[2]
  of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 64, City of Makati in Criminal Case No. 88-538 finding petitioner and his co-accused Efren O. Olesco guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of estafa through falsification of public document.
The petitioner, Roberto Fernandez (FERNANDEZ) together with Efren O. Olesco (OLESCO) and Nicanor R. Gatchalian, Jr. (GATCHALIAN) were charged with the crime of estafa through falsification of public document in an information
[3]
  that reads as follows:
âThat on or about the 14
th
 day of December, 1987, in the Municipality of Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who are all private individuals, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping and aiding one another by means of deceit and false pretenses executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud Sta. Ines Melale Forest Products, Inc., represented by Atty. Oscar P. Beltran, in the following manner, to wit: the said accused, upon their false manifestation and fraudulent representation that they have the power and capacity to secure a defendant counterbond for the lifting of a writ of preliminary attachment in the sum of P500,000.00 to be used by the said complainant in Civil Case No. 3226 of Branch V of the Regional Trial Court of Agusan Del Norte and Butuan City in which the said complainant was the party defendant and which representation and manifestation the accused knew to be false, succeeded in inducing the same complainant to give and to deliver to them the sum of P50,000.00 which is equivalent to 10% of the face value of said counterbond representing the premium thereof in consideration of Counterbond No. JCR 00300 dated December 14, 1987 purportedly issued by the First Integrated Bonding & Insurance Co., Inc. and notarized by Notary Public Benito Salandanan of Manila which the accused falsified by making it appear that the same was signed by Eduardo V. Gadi and that it was regularly issued by the said bonding and insurance company when, in truth and in fact, as accused well knew, the same was not issued by it, and the accused, once in possession of said money, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously appropriate and use the same to their own personal use and benefit, to the damage and prejudice of the complainant Sta. Ines Melale Forest Products, Inc., represented by Atty. Oscar P. Beltran, in the aforestated amount of P50,000.00.â
[4]
On April 29, 1988, the three (3) accused were arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty with the assistance of counsel.
[5]
  Thereafter, trial ensued. The case against GATCHALIAN was dismissed due to his death during the pendency of the trial.
[6]
At the trial, the prosecution presented as its witnesses Atty. Oscar P. Beltran, President of Sta. Ines Melale Forest Products Corporation, Manuel de Castro, Deputy Sheriff of Branch 137, Regional Trial Court of Makati, Melencio P. Cruz, a helper-assistant of insurance agent Manuel âBoyâ Reyes, Consuelo San Juan, court interpreter and representative of the Clerk of Court of Branch 5, Regional Trial Court of Agusan Del Norte, Butuan City and Atty. Rogelio B. Mendoza, legal counsel of the First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc.
The prosecution also offered in evidence Official Receipt No. 157 dated December 14, 1987 in the amount of P50,000.00 issued by Hexagon Surety Services, Inc. signed by accused Efren Olesco
[7]
 ; Machine copy of Counter Attachment Bond No. JCR 00300 dated December 14, 1987 issued by First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Corporation with a face value of P500,000.00
[8]
 ; another machine copy of the same Counter Attachment Bond No. JCR 00300 filed by defendant Ines Melale Corporation in Civil Case No. 3226 pending before RTC Branch 5, Butuan City
[9]
 ; parts of the Case Records of Civil Case No. 3226 brought by witness Consuelo San Juan as part of her testimony
[10]
 ; Sinumpaang Salaysay of witness Melencio Cruz consisting of two pages with his signature thereon
[11]
 ; Manifestation and Motion of Atty. Rogelio Mendoza dated January 04, 1988 filed before RTC, Branch 5, Butuan City
[12]
 ; and letter dated January 8, 1988 of Atty. Oscar Beltran to Col. Fernando Angara of the Southern Police Distrtict, Fort Bonifacio, Makati, Metro Manila requesting âpolice assistance in the investigation of a possible commission of the crime of Estafa Thru Falsification of Documentsâ 
[13]
After the prosecution rested its case, petitioner FERNANDEZ filed a Demurrer to Evidence which was denied by the trial court.
[14]
  Despite such denial, both accused Roberto Fernandez and Efren Olesco opted not to present evidence for their defense.
The facts established by the evidence are as follows:
Sometime in December 1987, the Regional Trial Court of Agusan del Norte, Branch V, Butuan City, issued a writ of preliminary attachment against the properties of private complainant Sta. Ines Melale Forest Products, Inc. (MELALE) defendant in the therein pending Civil Case No. 3226 filed by Kalilid Wood Industries Corporation.
In order to secure the lifting or discharge of the writ, MELALE, through its President, Atty. Oscar Beltran (BELTRAN), called up his friend Mr. Manuel de Castro (DE CASTRO), Deputy Sheriff of RTC Branch 137, Makati at about 11:00 oâclock in the morning of December 14, 1987 and requested him to look for a bonding company which can issue a counter attachment bond for his companyâs use in the said civil case.
[15]
  DE CASTRO obliged and from the third floor of the Chateau Building on F. Zobel Street, Makati where he holds office, he went down to the ground floor to see Manuel âBoyâ Reyes (REYES), an insurance agent. Unfortunately, REYES was not around at that time. It was Melencio Cruz (CRUZ), a compadre and helper-assistant of REYES, who attended to him and with whom DE CASTRO talked about the request of BELTRAN. CRUZ told DE CASTRO that he had to ask OLESCO, known to him as a Branch Manager of Interworld Assurance Corporation, whose office is at the second floor of the same building. When CRUZ returned to his office, he had with him an application form and indemnity agreement form for a counter attachment bond from Interworld Insurance which according to him, was given to him by OLESCO. CRUZ gave the blank form to DE CASTRO who in turn brought the form to BELTRAN who accomplished the same.
[16]
  At around 4:45 oâclock that afternoon, DE CASTRO returned and delivered the already accomplished bond application form to CRUZ who in turn brought the same to OLESCOâs office. Twenty minutes later, OLESCO and CRUZ came down together and handed to DE CASTRO (who was then waiting at CRUZâs office, Counterbond No. JCR 00300 dated December 14, 1987 in the amount of P500,000.00 issued by the First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Company and not by Interworld Insurance Company, signed by Eduardo V. Gadi and notarized by Notary Public Benito Salandanan of Manila.
[17]
  In return, DE CASTRO handed OLESCO the amount of P50,000.00 as premium payment for the bond. When asked by DE CASTRO why the Counterbond is a First Integrated Insurance Company bond and not an Interworld Insurance bond, OLESCO allegedly answered that Interworld Insurance Company branch in Butuan City was already closed. He added that in procuring the bond, âhe asked the help of Roberto Fernandez and Nicanor Gatchalian, Jr. for the issuance of the bond.â OLESCO acknowledged receipt of the amount of P50,000.00 by issuing Hexagon Surety Services, Inc. Official Receipt No. 157 also dated December 14, 1987
[18]
  which CRUZ also signed as witness that OLESCO actually received the P50,000.00
[19]
  Thereafter, BELTRAN filed the counterbond with the RTC of Agusan del Norte, Branch V in Butuan City to support MELALEâs pending motion to quash the writ of preliminary attachment earlier issued against it.
On January 8, 1988, BELTRAN learned that Atty. Rogelio Mendoza (MENDOZA), Legal Counsel of First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc., filed a Manifestation and Motion
[20]
  before the said RTC denying the issuance by First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc. of the aforementioned counterbond for the reason that the same was spurious or fake inasmuch as the First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc. had no officer or employee by the name of Eduardo Gadi and that the counterbond does not have the letter head of the First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Company.
Immediately thereafter, BELTRAN called DE CASTRO and requested him to arrange a confrontation with OLESCO, GATCHALIAN and FERNANDEZ. During the confrontation, only OLESCO and FERNANDEZ came and allegedly assured BELTRAN that the counterbond was genuine. Prior to the confrontation, BELTRAN never met accused OLESCO and FERNANDEZ.
[21]
  On January 8, 1988, BELTRAN also wrote then Superintendent Fernando Angara of the Southern Police District, Fort Bonifacio, Makati
[22]
  formally requesting âfor police assistance in the investigation of a possible commission of the crime of Estafa Thru Falsification of Documentsâ which thereafter led to the filing of the information against FERNANDEZ and OLESCO.
On September 21, 1995, the RTC found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged the dispositive portion of the decision reads:
âWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, this Court finds accused EFREN OLESCO and ROBERTO FERNANDEZ Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having committed ESTAFA thru falsification of public document, and sentences them to suffer an indeterminate prison term of four (4) years and two (2) months of 
prision correccional
 medium as minimum, to nine (9) years of 
prision mayor
 medium as maximum.
Both accused are ordered to jointly and severally indemnify complainant Santa Ines Melale Forest Product Corporation in the sum of P50,000.00.
With cost against the accused.
SO ORDERED.â
[23]
From the judgment of conviction, only FERNANDEZ appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the trial courtâs decision.
[24]
Petitionerâs motion for reconsideration was denied
[25]
  hence the instant petition for review where the petitioner raises the following arguments for consideration:
 
 
âA.
 
RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE CONVICTION OF PETITIONER WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FINDING OF THE COURT A QUO THAT AS OF THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THE DUMURRER TO EVIDENCE THERE WAS NO DIRECT EVIDENCE PROVING THAT PETITIONER HAD INDEED CONSPIRED IN COMMITTING THE OFFENSE.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. 
 
THE COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE CONVICTION OF THE ACCUSED ON THE BASIS OF MERE PRESUMPTION.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C. 
 
THE COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE CONVICTION OF PETITIONER WTHOUT INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWING THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE CONVICTION CONSIDERING THAT THE COURT A QUO FAILED TO SHOW THAT THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY PROVEN OR OTHERWISE STATED, THE COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS OF LAW.
 
 
 
 
Whether or not the offense of estafa thru falsification of a public document was in fact established.
Whether or not conspiracy attended the commission of the alleged offense.â
[26]
 
In support of his petition, the petitioner contends that respondent Court of Appeals erred in affirming the judgment of conviction because the trial court found no direct evidence linking him to the offense charged. He claims that the Court of Appeals relied on the mere imputations of his guilt made by the private complainant BELTRAN in his testimony in violation of the 
res inter alios acta 
and the hearsay rules. Moreover, considering that there was no positive and conclusive evidence adduced by the prosecution to prove the conspiracy; the alleged conspiracy between petitioner and co-accused OLESCO was based on mere conjecture. He should consequently be acquitted of the crime charged.
The core issue involved in this case is whether or not FERNANDEZ is guilty of committing the crime of estafa through falsification of public document in conspiracy with OLESCO.
After a careful review of the case, we rule in the negative and find the petition meritorious.
FERNANDEZ is charged with the crime of estafa described under Paragraph 2 (a) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, i.e. swindling or estafa committed by any person who shall defraud another by falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions or by means of other similar deceits executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud and in this particular case, in conspiracy with two other accused as defined under Article 8, of the Revised Penal Code.
[27]
To secure a conviction for this kind of estafa, the following requisites must concur, to wit:
 
 
(1)
 
 
that the accused made false pretenses or fraudulent representations as to his power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions;
 
 
 
(2)
 
 
that such false pretenses or fraudulent representations were made prior to or simultaneous with the commission of the fraud;
 
 
 
(3)
 
 
that such false pretenses or fraudulent representations constitute the very cause which induced the offended party to part with his money or property; and
 
 
 
(4) 
 
that as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage.
[28]
 
 
 
In convicting the petitioner, the trial court applied the rule that if a person had in his possession a falsified document, used it (uttered it), took advantage of it and profited thereby, he is, in the absence of satisfactory explanation, presumed to be the material author and the forger of the falsification.
[29]
  We quote the trial courtâs ratiocination as follows:
âThe unrefuted evidence for the prosecution established the fact that the counter bond with serial no. JCR 00300 under the name of First Integrated Bonding Insurance Company, Inc. is a fake bond. The complainant received the same from accused Efren Olesco and Roberto Fernandez they being the persons who secured the issuance of said bond. Being the source of said fake bond and there being no explanation from the accused how they came into possession of said fake bond, the presumption that they are the author of said fake bond attaches to them. That presumption has not been rebutted. Mere denial of their participation without supporting proof would not be sufficient to exculpate them from liability. The crime committed is Estafa thru falsification of public document. The falsification of the surety bond (Counter bond) a notarized document, was resorted to by the accused in order to defraud complainant.â
[30]
 
In affirming the decision of the trial court, the Court of Appeals adopted the trial courtâs reasoning and added that the petitionerâs participation in the issuance of the fake counterbond was proved by the testimony of DE CASTRO and was confirmed by the testimony of BELTRAN.
We disagree.
To our mind, the evidence is not sufficient to form a basis for petitionerâs conviction.
First of all, the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses linking FERNANDEZ to the commission of the crime are all hearsay in nature for they are not based on the witnessesâ own personal knowledge.
Prosecution witness DE CASTRO testified that:

A: 
 
When I came back to the Office of Mr. Melecio Cruz, I told him to tell Olesco that I have the money so that he can give me the bond.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATTY. BAÃARES:

Fernandez and Gatchalian for the issuance of that bond, First Integrated bond.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATTY. BAÃARES:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
That was an answer for the second question your Honor. The question is that: when the witness said and testified that he asked Olesco why it was the First Integrated while the application was an Interworld..
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATTY. BAÃARES:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
But he never testified that he conversed with Olesco who told him that Olesco will ask the help of Fernandez and Gatchalian. What the witness testify was that it was Melencio Cruz who told him that Olesco will ask the help of Gatchalian.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATTY. BAÃARES:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I submit your Honor after all I will cross-examine the witness.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It was Olesco who told him (sic) he asked the help of Fernandez and Gatchalian.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATTY. BAÃARES:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
That was the answer to the later question, may we just place on record our objection your Honor so that when the transcript of the stenographic notes shall have already been transcribed we can raise the same objection at the earliest possibility.

FISCAL:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With Exhibit H your honor we would like to confirm the testimony of the witness and we terminate our direct examination.â
[32]
 
 
 
Section 36, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court provides that âa witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his own knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception x x x.â Thus, any evidence, whether oral or documentary, is hearsay if its probative value is not based on the personal knowledge of the witness but on the knowledge of some other person not on the witness stand.
[33]
  In the present case, neither DE CASTRO nor CRUZ, the prosecutionâs main witnesses, had personal knowledge that FERNANDEZ in any way helped or aided OLESCO in the facilitation or the procurement of the counter bond. In fact, DE CASTRO admitted that he did not know if OLESCO was able to secure the help of FERNANDEZ and GATCHALIAN. And even assuming that DE CASTRO could testify to the alleged statements made by OLESCO implicating FERNANDEZ in the commission of the crime, said statements may still not be utilized against FERNANDEZ, who never had the opportunity to cross-examine OLESCO, for being violative of the 
res inter alios
 rule which ordains that the rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration or omission of another.
[34]
Secondly, although a conspiracy was alleged in the information, there is no evidence to prove that a conspiracy existed between FERNANDEZ and OLESCO. As a manner of incurring criminal liability, the same degree of proof necessary to establish the crime is required to establish a finding of criminal conspiracy, that is proof beyond reasonable doubt.
[35]
  Nowhere in the decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals, do we find any mention in the testimonies of the witnesses, much less proof of the existence of conspiracy between OLESCO and FERNANDEZ to defraud private complainant MELALE or to commit the crime of estafa through falsification of public document nor was evidence adduced of any act of FERNANDEZ that may be construed as an overt act in the furtherance of a conspiracy. Based on the evidence on record, the prosecution failed to prove that OLESCO conspired and/or connived with the petitioner or 
vice versa
 both in the procurement, preparation and facilitation in the issuance of the spurious counterbond and in defrauding private complainant in the amount of P50,000.00.
Besides, evidence discloses that the petitioner was not present or with OLESCO during the whole day of December 14, 1987 and did not witness or participate in any of those acts or events which happened on that day starting with the negotiation conducted by DE CASTRO through CRUZ for the procurement of a counter attachment bond needed by BELTRAN; the accomplishment of the application form for the bond made by BELTRAN and the filing thereof with OLESCO made by DE CASTRO through CRUZ; the preparation and delivery by OLESCO of the bond to DE CASTRO; the payment made by DE CASTRO to OLESCO of the cash amount of P50,000.00 as premium payment therefor; and the acknowledgment by OLESCO of his actual receipt of said amount of P50,000.00 as evidenced by Hexagon Surety Services, Inc. Official Receipt No. 157 dated December 14, 1987 which OLESCO signed himself. In fact, the only evidence proffered tending to incriminate the petitioner is the testimony of DE CASTRO who stated that OLESCO informed him that the bond was issued with the help of petitioner FERNANDEZ and a certain GATCHALIAN which as previously stated, is inadmissible in evidence.
[36]
  BELTRANâs assertion that FERNANDEZ admitted that he delivered the counter bond and that he facilitated in procuring the same during their alleged confrontation fails to persuade us considering that this was not corroborated and was in fact contradicted by the testimony of DE CASTRO who testified that only OLESCO delivered the counter bond to him. Moreover, the mere fact that FERNANDEZ allegedly claimed that the counterbond was genuine does not establish that he had knowledge that the counterbond was spurious. Neither does it prove that he conspired with or participated in the procurement thereof or was ever in possession thereof.
The Court of Appeals therefore erroneously applied the presumption that the person in possession of the falsified document is the author thereof for the reason that there is no evidence to prove that FERNANDEZ was ever in possession of, used, took advantage of and/or profited by the use of the fake counter bond.
In all criminal cases, mere speculation and probabilities cannot substitute for proof required to establish the guilt of an accused beyond reasonable doubt. Suspicion no matter how strong can not sway judgment.
[37]
  Where there is reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, he must be acquitted even though his innocence may be doubted since the constitutional right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty can be overthrown only by proof reasonable doubt.
[38]
  When the guilt of the accused has not been proven with moral certainty, it is our policy of long standing that the presumption of innocence of the accused must be favored and his exoneration be granted as a matter of right.
[39]
WHEREFORE,
 on the foregoing premises, the assailed decision of the Court of Appeals is 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
. Petitioner Roberto Fernandez is 
ACQUITTED
 of the crime charged on the ground of reasonable doubt.
