[ G.R. No. 173612, March 26, 2008 ]


DOMINADOR MALANA AND RODEL TIAGA, PETITIONERS, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT. 
D E C I S I O N




TINGA, J,:


The petitioners Dominador Malana (Dominador) and Rodel Tiaga (Rodel), together with their   acquitted co-accused Elenito Malana (Elenito), were charged with the crime of murder and multiple frustrated murder before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 12. The charges
[1]
 stemmed from an incident on 28 May 2000 that left Betty Capsa-Roxas (Betty) dead, and her daughter and granddaughter injured. The appellants pleaded not guilty during the arraignment.
The prosecution presented the two adult survivors of the ghastly crime, Vicente Roxas Jr., (Vicente) and his daughter Suzette Roxas (Suzette), as its main witnesses.
They testified as follows: In the evening of 28 May 2000, Vicente, his wife, Betty, Suzette, and the latter's infant daughter, Jenny Rose de la Cruz (Jenny), were asleep inside their house in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. Their house is a single-storey structure with spaces apportioned for the living room, the kitchen, and one bedroom.
[2]
 Vicente and Betty slept at the living room, while Suzette and Jenny occupied the bedroom. 
[3]
Vicente testified that at around 11:30 p.m., he was awakened by the sound of dogs barking. He saw the kitchen door of their house on fire. He tried to douse the flames with water, but the fire fuming of the smell of gasoline, spread out instead. Vicente woke Betty and told her to fetch help. As Betty opened the main door of their house, Dominador, Rodel, and a third man whom he identified as Ronnie Malana, suddenly appeared and entered the house.
[4]
 Since these individuals  had  previously threatened  to  kill Vicente and his entire
family, Vicente, upon seeing them, ran through the burning kitchen door and out of the house to seek help from his brother-in-law, Roberto Oredero, whose house was merely 30 meters away.
[5]
 After escaping several meters from his house, Vicente heard an explosion and saw the fire engulf his entire house.
[6]
Meanwhile, Suzette, who was awakened by her parents' panicked reaction to the kitchen fire, cradled Jenny and saw the three men enter their house when her mother opened the main door. Dominador and Rodel were standing behind the third man.
[7]
 She testified that the third man carried a round one-gallon container with a
wick of three to four inches in length. Rodel lit the wick with a match, and the third man threw the container into Suzette's bedroom. After that, the three men simultaneously ran away. Suzette saw the container burst into flames and explode.
[8]
The explosion killed Betty instantly, blowing apart her legs and one of her arms. Her body, from the waist down, was burned. The explosion also shattered and exposed the bone of Suzette's left leg and knocked  her  front teeth  out.  The doctors  could  not save Suzette's
shattered left leg so the same was amputated from below the knee. Had it not  been for  the  prompt medical attention she received, Suzette would have died from the injuries she had sustained from the explosion.
[9]
  Jenny survived the blast with barely any injury.
Vicente also testified that appellants had been threatening to liquidate him and his family, due to their belief that he was in the practice of witchcraft by which he had caused the deaths of Rodel's parents-in-law.
[10]
Appellants proffered the defenses of denial and alibi. Dominador testified that on the date and time of the crime, he was working as a construction worker in Parian, Calamba, Laguna and that
he had been in Laguna since 11 May 2000 until the end of the month. He claimed  that  he was  implicated  by Vicente  because  the latter
thought that he had something to do with the elopement of Suzette.
[11]
  He pointed  to  Salvador Villafuerte, Roman Villafuerte, Boyet Villafuerte, and Mondring Erederos as the perpetrators of the crime.
[12]
 Rodel testified that he was recuperating from illness in Binahaan, Pagbilao, Quezon when the incident took place. He claimed that he was implicated because he helped Dominador in engaging the services of a counsel.
[13]
 Elenito similarly gave the alibi that he was engaged as a construction worker together with Dominador in Laguna when the crime occurred. He also denied that his alias is "Ronnie," the name of the third perpetrator identified by Vicente.
[14]
The RTC, in a Decision
[15]
 dated 21 February 2003, found Dominador and Rodel guilty of two (2) separate crimes of murder and frustrated murder, and acquitted Elenito on the ground of reasonable doubt. The trial court gave credence to the eyewitness accounts of Vicente and Suzette who positively identified the appellants as two of the three perpetrators of the crime. However, the trial court acquitted Elenito as he was not positively identified by Suzette as the third man and his physical appearance does not fit the description of the tall fat man seen by Suzette.
Appellants appealed from the trial court's decision to the Court of Appeals. The appellate court, in a Decision
[16]
 dated 20 April 2006, affirmed the guilt of appellants but modified their sentences such that each of them is liable for the complex crime of murder with frustrated murder and attempted murder; hence, it sentenced each of the appellants to suffer the penalty prescribed for the most serious crime which is death. The Court of Appeals denied appellants' motion for reconsideration in a Resolution
[17]
 dated 20 July 2006.
Hence, the present Petition
[18]
 before this Court.
Except as to the penalty of death, now commuted to 
reclusion perpetua
 pursuant to Republic Act No. 9346,
[19]
 we affirm appellants' conviction. There is no cogent reason to disturb the finding of guilt made by the trial court and affirmed by the appellate court. The issues raised by appellants involve weighing of evidence already passed upon by the trial court and the appellate court. Appellants question the credibility of the testimony of Vicente and Suzette and the weight given by the trial court to the testimony of the bomb specialist. The age-old rule is that the task of assigning values to the testimonies of witnesses in the stand and weighing their credibility is best left to the trial court which forms its first-hand impressions as a witness testifies before it. It is also axiomatic that positive testimony prevails over negative testimony.
[20]
Vicente positively identified appellants as two of the three assailants who barged into his house and committed the heinous crime. He testified on direct examination as follows:

I then saw my mother beside me burned and with her legs both cut off and half of her body burned and one of her arm also cut off, and her body from waist down she was burned. Also my left leg was also cut off and my front teeth were missing and both arms of my baby were slightly burned.
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
Make it of record that the witness has her left leg also amputated or cut off up to the -above the knee and it was wrapped with bandage and she has scratches with her.
[25]
 (Emphasis ours.)
The Court agrees with the appellate court's following observations:
We have no doubt in Suzette's testimony as she would not have lightly accused the herein accused-appellants if they were not the true malefactors of the crime committed. Indeed, as a direct victim, who lost her left leg to the crime; as mother, who had to bear the sight of her eight-month old baby injured by burns; and as a daughter, who witnessed her own mother burn to death, Suzette could never have just pinpointed to anyone to the crime.
Under her circumstances, surely, there could have been no other overriding reason for Suzette's damning testimony against the accused-appellants save for the purpose of making sure that justice was done and the culprits of the crime be held accountable and meted their proper punishment for their dastardly deed. Suzette's relationship to the victim of this case, including her personal injury, in accord with human nature, ensured that she would have the most interest in telling the truth, rather than prevaricate and send innocent men to rot in jail.
On the other hand, while Vicente did not actually see the accused-appellants perpetrate the crime, Vicente's testimony lends credence to the fact that the accused-appellants were present in the place, time, and date of the crime. The previous life threats made by the accused-appellants on Vicente and his family, and the exploding of the Roxas residence following Vicente's escape from his house, served to corroborate and shed light to Suzette's account of the crime.
[26]
There is no merit in appellants' assiduous assertion that they should be acquitted under the equipoise rule in view of what to them are doubts as to their guilt. This rule provides that where the evidence of the parties in a criminal case is evenly balanced, the constitutional presumption of innocence should tilt the scales in favor of the accused. There is, therefore, no equipoise if the evidence is not evenly balanced.
[27]
 Said rule is not applicable in the case before us because the evidence here presented is not equally weighty. The equipoise rule cannot be invoked where the evidence of the prosecution is overwhelming.
Against the direct, positive and convincing evidence for the prosecution, appellants could only offer denials and uncorroborated alibi. It is elementary that alibi and denial are outweighed by positive identification that is categorical, consistent and untainted by any ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter. Alibi and denial, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law.
[28]
 The prosecution witnesses positively identified appellants as two of the perpetrators of the crime. It is incumbent upon appellants to prove that they were at another place when the felony was committed, and that it was physically impossible for them to have been at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.
[29]
 This they failed to prove.
Appellants tried to sow reasonable doubt on their guilt by harping on minor factual matters and engaging in semantics. Their effort is futile. This Court cannot be led to a different result. The Court of Appeals correctly resolved all the issues raised by the appellants.
The appellate court correctly found appellants guilty of the complex   crime of  murder
[30]
  with frustrated  murder  and attempted murder  under Article  48
[31]
 of the Revised Penal Code. The explosion killed Betty instantly,
[32]
 while Suzette's left leg was amputated from below the knee
[33]
 and she would have died from the injuries she sustained had it not been for the prompt medical attention she received.
[34]
 Appellants' intent to kill is apparent when they threw the explosive device towards the direction of the victims. The killing of Betty by means of an explosive device qualifies the crime to murder under Article 248(3) of the Revised Penal Code. With respect to Suzette, appellants are guilty of frustrated murder inasmuch as all the acts necessary that would consummate the crime of murder were complete but she nevertheless survived due to causes independent of appellants' will.
[35]
 Jenny survived the blast with barely any injury. However, this is not to say that the crime committed against her was merely slight physical injuries because the appellants were motivated by the same intent to kill when they lobbed the explosive device inside Vicente's house. Since the injuries inflicted are not fatal, the crime committed is merely attempted murder.
The case before us is clearly governed by the first clause of Article 48 because by a single act, that of lobbing an explosive device inside Vicente's house, appellants committed three grave felonies, namely, (1) murder, of which Betty was the victim; (2) frustrated murder, of which Suzette was the injured party; and (3) attempted murder, of which Jenny was the injured party. A complex crime is committed when a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies. Appellants' single act of detonating an explosive device may quantitatively constitute a cluster of several separate and distinct offenses, yet these component criminal offenses should be considered only as a single crime in law on which a single penalty is imposed because the offenders were impelled by a single criminal impulse which shows their lesser degree of perversity.
[36]
Under the aforecited article, when a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies the penalty for  the  most serious  crime  shall be  imposed,  the same  to  be applied  in  its maximum period irrespective of the presence of modifying circumstances. Applying  the aforesaid provision of law, the maximum penalty for the most serious crime (murder) is death.
[37]
  However, pursuant to Republic Act No. 9346,
[38]
 the penalty of death properly imposed on the appellants by the Court of Appeals is hereby reduced to 
reclusion perpetua
.
To recapitulate the three acts done by appellants in tandem with a third man loom large in the prosecution evidence, namely: first, their dousing of Vicente's kitchen door with gasoline and setting it ablaze;
[39]
 second, their subsequent entry to the house when Betty opened the main door to seek help; and thence, third, their lobbing an explosive device inside the house, followed by their escape. The trial court and the appellate court did not anymore address the treacherous manner by which the crime was committed, as alleged in the Information. We reiterate our holding in 
People v. Comadre
[40]
 that:
Coming now to Antonio's liability, we find that the trial court correctly ruled that treachery attended the commission of the crime. For treachery to be appreciated two conditions must concur: (1) the means, method  and form of execution employed gave the
person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate; and (2) such means, methods and form of execution was deliberately and consciously adopted by the accused. Its essence lies in the adoption of ways to minimize or neutralize any resistance, which may be put up by the offended party.
Appellant lobbed a grenade which fell on the roof of the terrace where the unsuspecting victims were having a drinking spree. The suddenness of the attack coupled with the instantaneous combustion and the tremendous impact of the explosion did not afford the victims sufficient time to scamper for safety, much less defend themselves; thus insuring the execution of the crime without risk of reprisal or resistance on their part. Treachery therefore attended the commission of the crime.
It is significant to note that aside from treachery, the information also alleges the "use of an explosive" as an aggravating circumstance. Since both attendant circumstances can qualify the killing to murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, we should determine which of the two circumstances will qualify the killing in this case.
When the killing is perpetrated with treachery and by means of explosives, the latter shall be considered as a qualifying circumstance.
 Not only does jurisprudence
[
[41]
] 
support this view but also, since the use of explosives is the principal mode of attack, reason dictates that this attendant circumstance should qualify the offense instead of treachery which will then be relegated merely as a generic aggravating circumstance.
[
[42]
]
[43]
x x x
Under the aforecited article, when a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies the penalty for the most serious crime shall be imposed, the same to be applied in its maximum period 
irrespective of the presence of modifying circumstances, including the generic aggravating circumstance of treachery in this case
.
[
[44]
]
 Applying the aforesaid provision of law, the maximum penalty for the most serious crime (murder) is death.  The trial court, therefore, correctly imposed the death penalty.
[45]
Regarding damages, we affirm the monetary award granted by the Court of Appeals. Appellants judicially admitted the actual loss of the victims' house and their appliances and implements contained therein, subject to the court's consideration of depreciation value, amounting to P300,000.00; and of the victims' medical and burial expenses amounting to P15,340.15 and P9,610.00, respectively. Appellants are ordered to pay the heirs of Betty Capsa-Roxas civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00.
WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 00138 is 
AFFIRMED 
with the MODIFICATION
 that appellants are sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
r
eclusion perpetua
 without possibility of parole.
SO ORDERED.

 and 
Velasco, Jr.,

 The accusatory portion of the Information reads:
That on or about the 28
th
 day of May 2000, in the municipality of San Jose del Monte, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with explosives and with intent to kill, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously with evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength and treachery, attack, assault and throw explosives inside the house of Vicente Roxas Jr. which exploded thereby causing serious physical injuries on Betty Capsa-Roxas which directly caused her death and also causing serious physical injuries to Suzette Roxas and Jenny Rose de la Cruz which required the amputation of the left leg of said Suzette Roxas and medical attendance for more than 30 days with respect to Jenny Rose de la Cruz, which ordinarily would have caused the death of the said Suzette Roxas and Jenny Rose de la Cruz, thus performing all the acts of execution which should have produced the crime of murder as consequence, but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent of their will, that is, by the timely and able medical assistance rendered to said Suzette Roxas and Jenny Rose de la Cruz which prevented their deaths.

 ART. 6. Consummated, frustrated, and attempted felonies.- Consummated felonies, as well as those which are frustrated and attempted, are punishable.
A felony is consummated when all the elements necessary for its execution and accomplishment are present; and it is frustrated when the offender performs all the acts of execution which would produce the felony as a consequence but which, nevertheless, do not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrator.
There is an attempt when the offender commences the commission of a felony directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance.
