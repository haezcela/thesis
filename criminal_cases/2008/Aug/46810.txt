THIRD DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 163331, August 29, 2008 ]


ARELLANO NOVICIO, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES , RESPONDENT.
DECISION




NACHURA, J.:


Before this Court is a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
[1]
 under Rule 45 of the Rules of Civil Procedure seeking the reversal of the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision
[2]
 dated July 31, 2003 which affirmed
 
the Decision
[3]
 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baler, Aurora, Branch 66, dated May 9, 2001, convicting petitioner Arellano Novicio (petitioner) of the crime of Frustrated Homicide.
The Facts
Petitioner was charged with the crime of Frustrated Homicide in an Information
[4]
 dated December 11, 1998, for allegedly shooting private complainant Mario Mercado (Mario). The accusatory portion thereof  states:
That at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening on September 24, 1998 in Bacong, San Luis, Aurora and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with intent to kill, did then and there, unlawfully, feloniously and willfully attack, assault and use personal violence upon Mario Mercado by shooting him with a short firearm as a result of which the latter sustained a gunshot wound: POE 1 cm., (R) public area, POX 1", lacerated stellate (L) gluteus thereby performing all the acts of execution which would produce crime of Homicide were it not for a timely and effective medical attendance which prevented his death.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
Petitioner voluntarily surrendered and posted the corresponding bail bond for his provisional liberty in the amount of P24,000.00.  Thus, the RTC ordered that the warrant of arrest issued against petitioner be recalled.
[5]
 Upon arraignment on January 29, 1999, petitioner pleaded not guilty to the offense charged.
[6]
 Thus, trial on the merits ensued. In the course of the trial, two varying versions arose.  Said versions as found by the CA are culled as follows:
There are two versions of what had transpired on September 24, 1998, at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening, at Bacong, San Luis, Aurora, particularly in front of the house of Reynaldo Novicio, where the latter's grandchild was having a birthday celebration.
According to private complainant Mario F. Mercado, on that day, time and place, he was at the party[,] drinking with Edmund Acosta, Alipio Leander, Jr., Reynaldo Novicio, Aniano Paquia, Demetrio Valenzuela and a certain Andy[,] when accused-appellant Arellano Novicio arrived; as the accused-appellant sat with them, he (Arellano) drew a gun from his waist and sat on it after a while, the accused-appellant pointed to him (Mario) saying "
Huwag kang tatayo Boy
"; when he (Mario) was about to stand the accused-appellant shot him; he (Mario) ran to the house of Reynaldo Novicio to hide in a room but Arnold Novicio, the son of the accused-appellant, forcibly opened it saying "
Ano-ano Boy, tapusin na kita
" while aiming a short gun at him; Shelly Novicio[-]Iporac, who was inside the room, shouted "
Papa, may tama si Kuya Mar
" so Arnold left him; then, he (Mario) went out of his hiding place and was later brought to the hospital for treatment,
[7]
 the accused-appellant had a continuing grudge against him because in the evening of July 23, 1998,
[8]
  the former also pointed a gun at him.
[9]
  The private complainant's story is corroborated by his wife, Maricris Mercado
[10]
 and his father-in-law Demetrio Valenzuela.
[11]
On the part of accused-appellant Arellano Novicio, he claims that when he arrived on that day, time and place via a motorcycle driven by Walfredo Cruz, they were invited to drink with Demetrio Valenzuela, Aniano Paquia, Edmund Acosta, his brother-in-law Andy, his brother Reynaldo Novicio and private complainant Mario Mercado, who were already noisy as there were empty bottles of gin scattered around; before he (Arellano) could sit, the private complainant told him "
O, dumating  na pala ang bata ni Governor
," which statement he ignored because it was obvious that the latter was already drunk; as he (Arellano) conversed with the group, the private complainant told him "
Paano ngayon Sec., amin na ang munisipyo
," but he pretended not to hear it; it seemed that the private complainant was not satisfied since he continued riling him to the extent of even telling him to prepare because he would be axed (
sibakin
) from the government service; when he (Arellano) could no longer endure the fabrications and lies being told by the private complainant, he told him to stop because no one would believe him; the private complainant, resenting what he (Arellano) had told him, suddenly stood and drew a .38 caliber revolver from his waist and pointed it at him; immediately, he (Arellano) held the hand of the private complainant and tried to get the gun from the latter; since he (Arellano) could not get hold of the gun, he did his best to change the direction to which the same was pointing, as a result of which they grappled with each other until they fell to the ground, causing the gun to go off and finally fall to the ground; at that moment, his (Arellano) brother Reynaldo pulled him and told him to run because the private complainant was in the act of picking up the gun so he ran away as fast as he could; for fear that the private complainant was still looking for him, he (Arellano) went to the house of Dading Serrano and returned home only the following morning when he was informed by his brother Reynaldo that the private complainant was a wounded when the gun went off while they were grappling for its possession; he (Arellano) never had the intention of killing nor injuring the private complainant as shown by the circumstance that he could have shot  the  private  complainant  in  a  vital  part of his body as he was very near him.
[12]
  The accused-appellant's version is corroborated by Reynaldo Novicio,
[13]
 Edmund Acosta,
[14]
 Walfredo Cruz,
[15]
 Arnold Novicio
[16]
 and Arnel Pena.
[17]
  In addition, they allege that after the accused-appellant ran away, they saw the private complainant handing the gun to his father-in-law Demetrio Valenzuela.  Arnold Novicio also denied pointing a gun at the complainant.
[18]
As a result of this incident, per medical findings of one Dr. Roberto Correa, (Dr. Correa), Medical Officer IV of the Aurora Memorial Hospital (Hospital), Mario sustained a gunshot wound, the point of entry of which was located in the right pubic area (lower abdomen), measuring one (1) inch in size and the point of exit was located at the left gluteus (buttocks), measuring one (1) inch in size and stellated in shape.
[19]
 Dr. Correa testified that it is possible that the wound was fatal in nature. Thus, due to the nature of the injury sustained and the possibility of hitting a vital organ, the doctors decided that Mario be transferred to the Dr. Paulino J. Garcia Memorial Research and Medical Center (Center) in Cabanatuan City.
[20]
The RTC's Ruling
On May 9, 2001, the RTC found material inconsistencies in the testimonies of the petitioner and his witnesses, thereby placing their candor and credibility in question. Moreover, the RTC opined that the finding that the crime committed was Frustrated Homicide could be inferred from the kind of weapon used, the location of the wound and the seriousness thereof. Finding that the petitioner used a short revolver as weapon, that Mario sustained a gunshot wound at his lower abdomen and that such was fatal in nature per Dr. Correa's testimony, the RTC held that petitioner was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Homicide. Thus, the RTC disposed of this case in this wise:
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused Arellano Novicio GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated homicide and considering the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender without any aggravating circumstance to offset the same and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, hereby sentences him to suffer an indeterminate penalty ranging from 
four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day of prision correccional as minimum up to eight (8) years of prision mayor as maximum and to pay the costs.
The Court reserves to Mario Mercado the right to institute a separate civil action for the recovery of the civil liability of the accused.
SO ORDERED.
Aggrieved, petitioner appealed the RTC Decision to the CA.
[21]
The CA's Ruling
On July 31, 2003, the CA affirmed 
in toto
 the ruling of the RTC, holding that the petitioner's claim that the prosecution's evidence is fabricated and imaginary cannot prevail over the testimonies by the victim, Mario and his father-in-law, Demetrio Valenzuela (Demetrio), which were credible, sincere and without any showing of ill motive on the latter's part. The CA also held that it is not the number of witnesses that will move a trial court to acquit or convict an accused but the credibility of the witnesses and their sincerity in narrating the events leading to the incident in question. Moreover, the CA discarded petitioner's defense that he merely acted in self-defense. The CA opined that Mario did not commit any unlawful aggression against the petitioner as the latter was in possession of the gun at the time. Finally, the CA accorded great weight and respect to the factual findings of the RTC, particularly in the evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses.
Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration
[22]
 of the assailed Decision which the CA denied in its Resolution
[23]
 dated April 20, 2004.
Hence, this Petition based on the following assignment of errors:
THE HONORABLE COURT A QUO ERRED IN RULING OUT THAT THE APPELLANT-PETITIONER ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE; [AND]
THE HONORABLE COURT A QUO ERRED IN RULING THAT THE APPELLANT-PETITIONER ACTED WITH INTENT TO KILL.
Petitioner argued that: based on the testimonies of the petitioner and his witnesses, it is clear that petitioner merely acted in self-defense; Mario was the aggressor because he drew his gun and aimed it at petitioner; and the CA manifestly overlooked and failed to perceive such fact. Moreover, petitioner claimed that: petitioner did not act with intent to kill since Mario sustained a single gunshot wound which required only a few days of hospital confinement; the testimony of Dr. Correa gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to the serious nature of the said wound as Dr. Correa stated that it was possible that the wound was fatal in nature; Dr. Correa's medical findings do not justify petitioner's conviction for Frustrated Homicide as it is required that the assailant must have performed all acts of execution to effectuate the intent to kill. Verily, such intent must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, where intent to kill was not sufficiently established, the accused must be convicted of a less serious offense.
[24]
 Furthermore, petitioner's defense that he did not own the said gun must be given credence by this Court as it was corroborated by other competent witnesses that before Mario boarded the tricycle, he handed the said gun to Demetrio. Lastly, petitioner submitted that there is a question of law involved in this case as the Court is asked to resolve the doubts or differences as to what the law is on certain state of facts, hence, the instant Petition under Rule 45 is in order.
[25]
On the other hand, respondent People of the Philippines through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) averred that: the petitioner's guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt; petitioner failed to establish his claim of self-defense; invoking such claim of self-defense, the burden of proving his innocence is now shifted to the petitioner; standing by the ruling of the RTC, it is unnatural for the petitioner's relatives not to tender any aid if he was indeed attacked by Mario; petitioner could have reported the matter immediately to the police; Shelly Novacio-Iporac's testimony rebutted the claim of the petitioner and his other witnesses that Mario as the aggressor immediately ran away after the incident and that petitioner handed the gun to his father-in-law, Demetrio; there was no unlawful aggression on the part of Mario to justify petitioner's act of shooting him and absent such element of unlawful aggression, there could never be self-defense, whether complete or incomplete. Moreover, petitioner's intent to kill was clearly manifested in his acts of using a lethal weapon, 
i.e.
, a gun, in attempting to shoot the victim for the second time, and in the seriousness of the injury sustained. The OSG posited that when Dr. Correa in his testimony said that the wound was possibly fatal, he clearly meant that without the proper medical attention and intervention, Mario could have died. Thus, Mario was transferred to another hospital. The OSG claimed that by questioning the serious nature of the injury sustained, petitioner raised a question of fact which is beyond the office of a Petition for Review on 
Certiorari
 under Rule 45 as only pure questions of law may be entertained in this case. Lastly, the OSG submitted that the factual findings of the RTC as affirmed by the CA must be given credence.
[26]
On the first issue, petitioner invokes self-defense. Thus, it was incumbent upon him to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he indeed acted in defense of himself. For in invoking self-defense, the accused admits killing or seriously wounding the victim and accordingly, has the burden of justifying his act. The requisites of self-defense are: (1) unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel or prevent it; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.
[27]
The settled rule is that the determination of whether or not the accused acted in self-defense, complete or incomplete, is a factual issue. And equally entrenched is the legal aphorism that factual findings of the trial court and its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses and its conclusions anchored on its findings are accorded by the appellate court high respect, if not conclusive effect, more so when affirmed by the CA. The exception is when it is established that the trial court ignored, overlooked, misconstrued or misinterpreted cogent facts and circumstances which, if considered, will change the outcome of the case.
We have reviewed the records of the RTC and the CA and we find no justification to deviate from the trial court's findings and its conclusion.
[28]
 We find that the petitioner has not adequately discharged his burden of proving the elements of self-defense.
As found by the RTC, affirmed by the CA and espoused by the OSG, there are indeed material inconsistencies in the testimonies of petitioner and his witnesses as to the incident. Petitioner and his witnesses claimed that after the shooting incident, Mario ran away, carried his gun with him and before boarding the tricycle, handed the same to Demetrio. Mario denied this, testifying that he ran to Reynaldo Novicio's  house and hid in the room of Shelly Novicio-Iporac. Shelly herself corroborated the testimony of Mario. This rebuts the defense contention that Mario owned the gun and tried to hide the weapon through Demetrio.  Likewise, we find it contrary to human reason and experience that petitioner's brother, relatives and friends, who were present at the time in the house of Reynaldo, merely stood by when petitioner was allegedly assaulted by Mario. Petitioner would have been defended by his relatives the moment Mario allegedly insulted and poked the gun at petitioner. Thus, we agree with the RTC's and the CA's ruling that the prosecution's version is credible and clear. Moreover, it is of record that petitioner at an earlier date poked a gun at Mario. Logically, then, petitioner was the aggressor. Because the first element of self-defense is not present, such defense must fail.
Note that the RTC found Mario and Demetrio to be credible witnesses, deserving full faith and credence. Note likewise that the CA did not disturb the RTC's appreciation of their credibility. It is doctrinal that the trial court's assessment of the credibility of witnesses especially when affirmed by the CA is entitled to great weight and respect. Petitioners failed to show any persuasive reason for us to depart from this doctrine, other than insisting that several witnesses for the defense contradicted the prosecution's version of the incident. Credibility is weighed not by the number of witnesses but by the quality of their testimonies.
[29]
On the second issue, our ruling in 
Rivera v. People
[30]
 is instructive:
An essential element of murder and homicide, whether in their consummated, frustrated or attempted stage, is intent of the offenders to kill the victim immediately before or simultaneously with the infliction of injuries. Intent to kill is a specific intent which the prosecution must prove by direct or circumstantial evidence, while general criminal intent is presumed from the commission of a felony by 
dolo
.
In 
People v. Delim
 [444 Phil. 430, 450 (2003)], the Court declared that evidence to prove intent to kill in crimes against persons may consist, 
inter alia
, in 
the means used by the malefactors, the nature, location and number of wounds sustained by the victim, the conduct  of  the  malefactors before, at the time, or immediately after the killing of the victim, the circumstances under which the crime was committed and the motives of the accused.
 If the victim dies as a result of a deliberate act of the malefactors, intent to kill is presumed.
It is petitioner's postulation that the lone gunshot wound of Mario does not establish intent to kill. However, the number of wounds inflicted is not the sole consideration in proving intent to kill. In 
Adame v. Hon. Court of Appeals
,
[31]
 a single gunshot wound was inflicted on the victim but this Court convicted the accused therein of frustrated homicide. Just like in 
Adame
, it is worth stressing that petitioner used a gun in this case, and, if not for Mario's act of shoving the table at him, petitioner could have fired a second shot. Furthermore, the nature and location of the wound should also be considered.  Dr. Correa's positive testimony was that the wound sustained by Mario could cause death if left untreated. In fact, the first hospital to which Mario was brought could not fully cater to the medical treatment required, and Mario had to be transferred to the Center. This Court has repeatedly held that if the victim's wound would normally cause death, then the last act necessary to produce homicide would have been performed and death would have resulted were it not for the timely medical attention given to the victim.
[32]
All told, we find no reversible error on the part of the findings of both the RTC and the CA.
WHEREFORE
, the instant Petition is 
DENIED
. The assailed Court of Appeals Decision in CA-G.R. CR No. 25312, dated July 31, 2003, finding petitioner Arellano Novicio guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Homicide, is hereby 
AFFIRMED
. Costs against the petitioner.
