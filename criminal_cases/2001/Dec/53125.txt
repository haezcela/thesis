PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO BANIQUED, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
DECISION




VITUG, J.:


Francisco Baniqued was charged with the crime of rape, on two counts, before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 65, of Tarlac, Tarlac, in separate criminal complaints, both dated 11 November 1996, which read:
In Criminal Case No. 9400
 -
"The undersigned Arlene Baniqued, 15 years old, represented at this instance by the DSWD, after the necessary preliminary investigation conducted by Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Aladin C. Bermudez, Jr. in accordance with the Rules on Criminal Procedure, accuses her own father, Francisco Baniqued, a resident of Abagon, Gerona, Tarlac, with a crime of Rape, committed as follows:
"That on or about the month of June, 1996, at Brgy. Abagon, Municipality of Gerona, Province of Tarlac, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with lustful design and grave abuse of moral ascendancy and by force and intimidation, have sexual intercourse with his own daughter, Arlene Baniqued, the undersigned herein, against her will."
[1]
In Criminal Case No. 9401
 -
"That on or about the 4th day of September, 1996 at Brgy. Abagon, Municipality of Gerona, Province of Tarlac, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with lustful design and grave abuse of moral ascendancy and by force and intimidation, have sexual intercourse with his own daughter, Arlene Baniqued, the undersigned herein, against her will."
[2]
Upon his arraignment, the accused, duly represented by counsel, pled "not guilty" to the offenses charged; forthwith, trial ensued on the two cases.
The evidence for the prosecution was summarized by the Solicitor General in the Appellee's Brief submitted to the Court.
"Sometime in June 1996 at early dawn, private complainant Arlene Baniqued who at the time was fifteen (15) years old, was sleeping in the sala of her house while her brothers slept with her parents in the only bedroom of the house. She was awakened to find her father, appellant Francisco Baniqued, already undressed and on top of her (pp. 6-8, TSN, January 22, 1997).
"Appellant told her `Do not make any noise we will just play' (p. 9, ibid.) and proceeded to take off Arlene's short pants and panties. Arlene cried `Papa do not do it,' but appellant pointed a knife (`lanseta') at her and threatened to kill her (p. 10, ibid.) Appellant then proceeded to kiss Arlene's neck and successfully had sexual intercourse with her for thirty (30) minutes, caressing her breasts and laughing (p. 13-14, ibid.). Arlene could only cry feeling pain at the penetration (pp. 13-14, ibid.) and could not resist her father because she was crushed by his weight. When she struggled with her legs, appellant put down his knife and struck her thighs, then held both Arlene's hands with his left hand and held the knife with his right (pp. 6-7, 10, TSN, February 4, 1997).
"After appellant was finished, he merely got up and dressed, then asked Arlene `Anak, masarap ba?' Arlene did not say anything. When her father left her, she cried (pp. 14-15, TSN, January 22, 1997).
"The following morning, Arlene was feverish, but did not tell anyone in her family of the incident (Ibid.).
"In the evening of September 3, 1996, Arlene noticed that appellant was unusually affectionate towards her (`inaamo') (p. 7, TSN, January 28, 1997) and gave her money. Appellant even displayed his genitalia for Arlene to see while the latter was washing the dishes (Ibid.).
"Later at one o'clock in the morning of September 4, 1996 when the whole Baniqued family were sleeping in the bedroom, except for Arlene who was sleeping in the sala, she again woke up to find her father undressed and on top of her. She was already rid of her own shorts and panties (p. 17, TSN, January 22, 1997). Arlene pleaded with appellant by saying `Papa, do not do it' and pushed him away, but appellant was successful in having intercourse with her while pointing a knife at her chest. Arlene's ordeal lasted for fifteen (15) minutes. She again felt pain at the penetration and cried (pp. 17-19, 27-30, ibid.). After the intercourse, appellant just left Arlene (p. 20, ibid.).
"The following day, Arlene confided to her classmates what her father did to her and was advised to get out of their house immediately (Ibid.) Arlene likewise told her Aunt Dory and Uncle Mario of her ordeal. Her Aunt Dory then proceeded to bring Arlene to Guimba, Nueva Ecija to stay momentarily with a friend of the former (pp. 20-21, ibid.).
"Appellant was arrested on September 22, 1996 (p. 10, TSN, April 8, 1997) and the criminal investigation proceeded.
"Arlene presented herself for medical examination. The results thereof were submitted by the Medico-Legal Officer, Dr. Alicia E. Castro, in the Medico-Legal Certificate dated October 25, 1996, to wit:
 
 
"GENITALIA:
 
 mons pubis with black hair sparsely distributed, labia majora partially hiding the minora, fourchette U-shaped with minimal whitish mucoid discharge, hymen 
with old healed superficial lacerations at 3:00 o'clock, 5:00 o'clock, 6:00 o'clock positions
.'"
[3]
 
 
The accused, denying the accusations, claimed that he was not at home when the rape incidents allegedly occurred. He asserted that from June 1 to June 30, 1996, he was in San Carlos, Pangasinan, with his second wife, Virginia Taduran, while his children, including Arlene, were staying in their house in Brgy. Abagon, Gerona, Tarlac. The accused would only send money to his children, through Virginia, who would go home in Brgy. Abagon, Gerona, Tarlac, once a week in the month of June 1996. In August, 1996, the accused went home in Gerona only to discover that Arlene had by then left their house. The accused had previously threatened to stop supporting her in school due to her laziness and for being hardheaded. The accused went back to Pangasinan on 04 September 1996 and only returned to Brgy. Abagon on 15 September 1996. He was later informed by his sister-in-law Dory that she brought Arlene to Guimba, Nueva Ecija. On 23 September 1996, he was arrested by the police on the basis of the complaints for rape filed by his daughter.
On 07 July 1997, the trial court rendered its decision; it found the accused guilty, on two counts, of the crime of rape; it held:
"WHEREFORE, this Court finds accused Francisco Baniqued GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape as defined and penalized in Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, in Criminal Case No. 9400 and in Criminal Case No. 9401 and hereby sentences him in EACH CASE to suffer the penalty of DEATH by lethal injection; he is further ordered to pay complainant P50,000.00 for each case as moral damages, to pay complainant the amount of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages and to pay the costs."
[4]
The death penalty having been imposed, the records of the case were elevated to this Court for automatic review.
In his appeal brief, Francisco Baniqued contends that the trial court has gravely erred in convicting him and in sentencing him to suffer the extreme penalty.
In rape cases, the credibility of the victim is normally determinative of its outcome, her sole testimony, if credible, being quite often sufficient to declare a conviction.
[5]
 It becomes most important, therefore, to examine closely her testimony and how it is given before the trial court. The Court here reproduces, at length, her narration at the witness stand.

Arlene was categorical, spontaneous and consistent in giving her answers to the questions repeatedly propounded on her. The testimony she gave was plain and straightforward, unshaken by a rigid examination by both counsel, and unflawed by any inconsistency or contradiction, and it certainly deserves due credit.
[7]
 The trial court itself, which closely monitored the proceedings and observed Arlene at the stand, had this to say about her testimony -
"The Court finds Arlene's testimony about the rape replete with details that could not have been concocted by a girl of her youth to be more attuned to the truth. She said she was raped by her own father, the accused, in the early dawn sometime in June 1996 and again on September 4, 1996. That Arlene had been sexually abused was confirmed by Dr. Castro who examined complainant's genitalia on September 23, 1996 and found `her hymen with old healed, superficial lacerations at 3:00 o'clock, 5:00 o'clock and 6:00 o'clock positions.' Moreover, there is no showing that Arlene was impelled by any improper motive in making the accusation against her father, the accused. The willingness of the complainant to face police investigators and to submit to a physical examination is mute but eloquent testimony of the truth of her charge against her own father. Arlene could not have publicly disclosed that she had been raped by her own father and then undergo trial where she had to bare her traumatic and harrowing experience and be subjected to harassment, embarrassment and humiliation, if not ridicule, unless she was raped and her motive was solely to seek justice. She was only 15 years old, innocent, inexperienced, naive and guileless when first abused. It would be highly improbable for her against whom no proof of sexual perversity or loose morality had been shown, to fabricate charges, much more against her own father. And the stubborn fact is that the accused pleaded with complainant on two occasions for forgiveness for what he has done to her and in as many times Arlene spurned him."
[8]
Relative to the claim of appellant that Arlene filed the complaint for rape merely because of her resentment towards him, the trial court made this assessment -
"x x x This allegation is not enough to overcome the fact that the consequences of filing a case of rape are so serious that an ordinary woman would have second thoughts about filing charges against her rapist. It takes much more for a 15-year old lass to fabricate a story of rape, face police investigators and tell them that she was raped, have her private part examined, subject herself to the indignity of a public trial and endure a lifetime of ridicule. Arlene's testimony was categorical, positive and convincing. Her harrowing experience made her tearful at times in the course of her long testimony but throughout she maintained her child-like innocence in answering questions propounded to her both on direct and cross examination. The court noted that the confident look of the accused at the beginning of complainant's testimony degenerated into one of cautious dejection. Between the testimony of Arlene and her father, that of the former was more unfeigned, straightforward, frank and sincere, while the latter was deceptive, evasive, hollow and deep in half-truths."
[9]
The Court sees nothing of substance that can warrant a disregard, let alone a reversal, of the findings of the trial court.
Neither can the Court give credence to the defense of 
alibi
, a claim that has often been viewed with suspicion and received with caution not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but also because it is easy to fabricate. In order that this defense can prosper, it must be convincing enough to preclude any doubt on the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the 
locus criminis
 at the time of the incident,
[10]
 a fact which appellant has been unable to amply establish.
The crime of rape is defined and made punishable by Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act No. 7659,
[11]
 that, in part, reads:
"ART. 335. 
When and how rape is committed
. - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.
"1. By using force or intimidation;
"2. When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and
"3. When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.
"The crime of rape shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua.
"Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.
"When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.
"When the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.
"When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death.
"
The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:
"1. When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
"
The minority of the victim and her relationship with the accused are circumstances that can qualify the crime of rape and warrant the imposition of the death penalty. These circumstances, to be taken as such, should not only be properly alleged in the complaint or information but must also be established during the trial.
[12]
In the case at bar, while the father-daughter relationship was alleged and proven, the minority of the victim, although alleged, was not, however, sufficiently established. The birth certificate of the victim or, in lieu thereof, any documentary evidence like a baptismal certificate, school records and documents of similar nature or other credible evidence, that can help confirm the age of the victim have not, unexplainably, been presented during the trial.
[13]
 Except for the bare testimony of the victim of being fifteen years old, not too far below the age of 18 years, at the time of the rape, nothing from the records would satisfactorily prove the correct age of the victim. Instead of meting the death penalty, the court 
a quo
 should have thus only imposed 
reclusion perpetua
 on appellant.
Consistent with prevailing jurisprudence, the victim is entitled not only to P50,000.00 moral damages but also to P50,000.00 civil indemnity and P25,000.00 exemplary damages (on account of the relationship between the accused and victim) for each count of rape.
[14]
WHEREFORE, the decision of the court 
a quo
 convicting 
Francisco Baniqued
, on two counts, of rape is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that said appellant is sentenced to suffer, instead of the death penalty, two terms of 
reclusion perpetua
 and ordered to pay complainant 
Arlene Baniqued
 P50,000.00 civil indemnity, P50,000.00 moral damages, and P25,000.00 exemplary damages, for each of the two counts of rape. Costs
