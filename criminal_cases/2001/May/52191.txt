"A" and "I").
4) Artily Salvador, 45 years old, married, and a resident of Barangay Napti, Batan, Aklan, testified:

[4]
On April 27, 1999 the trial court rendered a decision finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape; the dispositive portion of the decision reads:
"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused GENER AGONCILLO Y BONSUELO, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of RAPE and hereby imposes upon him the supreme penalty of DEATH.
Further, the Court hereby orders the said accused to pay to the victim Rosalyn P. Salvador the amount of P75,000.00 as indemnity for the said offended party.
With COSTS against the accused.
SO ORDERED."
[5]
In view of the imposition of the death penalty, the case is now before this Court on automatic review.
In his brief, the accused-appellant assigns the following errors committed by the trial court:
I
THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY OF THE COMPLAINANT AND IN DISREGARDING THE EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE.
II
THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.
[6]
In support of his appeal, accused-appellant argues that the prosecution failed to establish the identity of Rosalyn's assailant beyond reasonable doubt considering that her identification of him failed to pass the rigid test of positive identification.  Accused-appellant points out the fact that it was very dark on the night Rosalyn was raped and that the illumination produced by the flashes of lightning rendered it difficult for her to see and identify her assailant. Accused-appellant also argues that his defense of alibi whereby he claims that he was sleeping in the house of Rogelio De La Cruz from 11:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m. of July 2, 1997 proves that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the place of the commission of the crime.  Moreover, accused-appellant contends that Rosalyn's testimony is tainted with numerous inconsistencies which cast serious doubt on the veracity of her assertions. Rosalyn underwent a medical examination the results of which were placed in a medico-legal report yet the injuries which she claimed to have sustained by reason of the assault, 
i.e
. contusions and hematoma on her lips and neck, were not described therein. Accused-appellant also maintains that the acts of the victim, her mother as well as her other siblings runs counter to human nature and experience.  In her testimony, Rosalyn's mother, Artily stated that Rosalyn told her that accused-appellant raped her on the morning following the alleged rape; that upon discovery thereof, she immediately looked for accused-appellant to verify his whereabouts on the night of the rape; and that she remained calm even as she confronted accused-appellant regarding the same.  It is accused-appellant's contention that had Artily believed that accused-appellant indeed raped Rosalyn, her natural reaction would have been to become hysterical and she would not have remained calm.  Furthermore, at the time of the incident, Rosalyn's siblings, who were with her in the house, did not take any steps to protect or help her, thus belying the commission of the crime imputed to him.  Even assuming for the sake of argument that the prosecution has proved accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, he contends that the lower court erred in appreciating the aggravating circumstances of dwelling, nighttime and uninhabited place despite the fact that the prosecution failed to present any evidence to prove the same.  It is also his position that the lower court erred in convicting him of rape with the use of a scythe in order to justify the imposition of the death penalty despite the fact that the prosecution did not present the scythe in court to support such allegation.  Finally, accused-appellant claims that the lower court was partial and biased and in fact pre-judged the case against him and that the lower court assumed facts not proved during trial all to the detriment of accused-appellant.
The arguments presented by accused-appellant do not persuade us. An examination of all the evidence presented before the trial court leads us to no other conclusion than that Rosalyn was indeed raped by accused-appellant.
Accused-appellant's main defense consisting of denial and alibi is not tenable.  The defense of alibi is the weakest of all defenses for it is easy to contrive and difficult to prove.
[7]
 Moreover, these defenses are overcome by a witness' positive identification of him as the perpetrator of the crime.
[8]
In the present case, Rosalyn categorically identified accused-appellant as her assailant and narrated vividly the sexual assault committed against her.  Rosalyn also established that although it was dark, the light emitted from the constant flashes of lightning that evening sufficiently illuminated the face of accused-appellant to enable her to recognize him, thus:

Will you please step down from the witness stand and point to the Court?

Tap his shoulder.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Witness pointed to a person who when asked his name answered, Gener Agoncillo). 
[9]
 
 
 
Accused-appellant attempts to discredit Rosalyn's identification of him by claiming that it was highly improbable for her to have seen his face considering the circumstances surrounding her abduction.  We are however convinced that the trial court did not err in upholding the credibility of Rosalyn and her positive identification of the accused-appellant.
First, Rosalyn was familiar with accused-appellant since he frequently passed the road fronting her house.
[10]
 Accused-appellant's claim that he never passed the feeder road fronting Rosalyn's house is belied by his own testimony, thus:

Second, Rosalyn had ample opportunity to ascertain the identity of accused-appellant considering the length of time she spent with him from the time she was abducted from her home at 11:00 p.m. and brought to the plantation until the time she returned home at 2:00 a.m..  Moreover, we agree with Rosalyn that the light emitted from the constant flashes of lightning enabled her to see accused-appellant's face. Her proximity to accused-appellant during the assault leaves no doubt as to the correctness of her identification for a man and woman cannot be physically closer to each other than during the sexual act.
[12]
Accused-appellant's claim that Rosalyn's parents have hostile feelings against him for allegedly suspecting him of punching a hole in their fishing boat and slashing their fishing net and for this reason are falsely accusing him of having raped Rosalyn is not worthy of belief.  It has been held that no mother, or parent as in the present case, would stoop so low as to subject their own daughter to the hardships and shame concomitant to a prosecution for rape just to assuage their own hurt feelings.  A parent would not sacrifice their daughter's honor to satisfy a grudge, knowing fully well that such an experience would certainly damage their daughter's psyche and mar her for life.  Neither would they subject their daughter to a public trial with its accompanying stigma on her as a victim of rape, if said charge is not true.
[13]
 Accused-appellant has failed to convincingly establish that in accusing him of rape, Rosalyn or her parents were moved by reasons other than obtaining justice.
We reject the claim that the reaction of Rosalyn's mother, Artily, after learning that Rosalyn was raped, was not consistent with human nature. We do not find it unnatural or illogical for the victim's mother to confront her daughter's assailant to ascertain whether or not he indeed raped her.  The fact that Artily appeared calm when she confronted him does not detract from her credibility.  From the records, it appears that Artily was gathering information from possible witnesses and was being careful before she made any accusations against accused-appellant.  People react differently to different situations and in the present case, the conduct of the victim's mother at that time would not detract from the veracity of the charges against accused-appellant.
Time and again this Court has ruled that the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are accorded great respect unless the court 
a quo
 overlooked substantial facts and circumstances, which if considered, would materially affect the result of the case.
[14]
 After a careful review of Rosalyn's testimony, we find no cogent and legal basis to disturb the trial court's finding upholding her credibility and disregarding the testimonies of the defense witnesses, considering that she remained steadfast in her narration and unfaltering in her testimony regarding the unfortunate incident. The evaluation or assessment made by the trial court acquires greater significance in rape cases because from the nature of the offense the only evidence that can oftentimes be offered to establish the guilt of the accused is the complainant's testimony.
[15]
 By its very nature, rape is committed with the least possibility of being seen by the public.
[16]
Moreover, there was no allegation, much less proof, that Rosalyn was motivated to falsely implicate him in the commission of such a heinous crime, and the absence of convincing evidence showing any improper motive on the part of the principal witnesses for the prosecution strongly tends to sustain the conclusion that no such improper motive exists, and that their testimonies are worthy of full faith and credit.
[17]
Although the medico-legal report
[18]
 does not state that Rosalyn sustained contusions and a hematoma on her lips and neck, the omission is not fatal.  It is well-established that the medical certificate is merely corroborative in character and is not an indispensable element in rape.
[19]
 More importantly, the contradiction existing between her testimony and the medico-legal report only pertains to the existence of the injuries she claims to have sustained on her lips and neck.  There is no conflict between the said report and her claim that she was raped since the report as testified to by Dr. Landolino MeÃ±ez confirms the sexual assault.
Finally, accused-appellant's allegation that the trial court was biased and pre-judged him is not substantiated by a reading of the records.  The fact that the trial judge asked questions during the course of the trial does not necessarily make him biased especially when it appears that the questions he propounded were clarificatory in nature and obviously aimed at elucidating the testimony of Rosalyn.
[20]
 The argument thrown in by accused-appellant that the trial court considered his alleged flight as an indication of his guilt despite the absence of proof of the same does not help his case.  While we agree that it is the obligation of the prosecution to clearly establish that he in fact fled, the absence of such an incriminatory circumstance is not sufficient to exculpate him and overturn the positive evidence against him.
The trial court properly convicted accused-appellant of the crime of rape with the use of a deadly weapon, which is the crime charged in the information.  Rosalyn established that when she was raped, accused-appellant brandished a scythe and threatened her with it.  Although the scythe was not presented in court, the production of a weapon used in the commission of the crime is not a condition 
sine qua non
 for the discharge of the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt for the same may not have been recovered at all from the assailant.
[21]
We however are constrained to agree with accused-appellant that the trial court erred in appreciating the aggravating circumstances of dwelling, nighttime, and uninhabited place in order to justify the imposition of the death penalty.
Dwelling is considered as an aggravating circumstance primarily because of the sanctity of privacy the law accords to the human abode.
[22]
 However, in the present case, Rosalyn was not raped therein.  Although she was abducted therefrom, accused-appellant was not charged with forcible abduction with rape but only with rape.  Considering that she was not raped in her home, dwelling cannot be appreciated.
The trial court also erred in appreciating the aggravating circumstance of nighttime and uninhabited place.  For nocturnity to properly attend the commission of a crime, it must be shown that it facilitated the commission of the offense and that it was purposely sought by the offender.  The fact that the offense was committed at night will not suffice to sustain 
nocturnidad
.
[23]
 In the present case, there was no evidence to prove that accused-appellant purposely sought the cover of night when he raped Rosalyn.  In the same vein, the aggravating circumstance of uninhabited place cannot also be appreciated in the absence of proof that solitude was purposely sought or taken advantage of to facilitate the commission of the crime.
[24]
 The term uninhabited place does not refer to the distance of the nearest house to the 
locus criminis
 for the more important consideration is whether the place of commission affords a reasonable possibility for the victim to receive some help.
[25]
 The evidence on record before us fails to provide any basis to conclude that the specific circumstances surrounding the scene of the rape were such that its state of being uninhabited prevented any reasonable possibility that the victim could have possibly solicited assistance to fend off her attacker.
The crime of rape is punished under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, 
viz
:
"ART. 335. - 
When and how rape is committed
.- Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:
1. By using force or intimidation;
2. When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and
3. When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.
The crime of rape shall be punished by 
reclusion perpetua
.
Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon
 or by two or more persons, 
the penalty shall be reclusion perpetua to death
." (Emphasis supplied)
Since the crime was committed with the use of a deadly weapon, 
i.e
. a scythe, it is punishable with 
reclusion perpetua
 to death.  In the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the penalty that should thus be imposed is 
reclusion perpetua
.
[26]
 Accused-appellant is also hereby ordered to indemnify the victim with the amounts of P50,000.00 as compensatory damages and P50,000.00 as moral damages.
[27]
