PARDO,
J.:


Accused Gregorio Jabonero
(hereafter, âGregorioâ) and Dominador Indoy and Teoderico Indoy (hereafter,
âDominadorâ and âTeodoricoâ), father and son, interposed an appeal from the
decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 127, Kalookan City finding them
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder for the killing of fifty-eight (58)
year old Perfecto Ollero Jaen (hereafter, âPerfectoâ), and sentencing each of
them to 
reclusion perpetua 
and to pay the heirs of the victim indemnity
for wrongful death in the amount of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) and one
hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) as moral damages.
[1]


The Facts


Ronaldo F. Lobrigo
(hereafter, âLobrigoâ) was the son-in-law of  Perfecto.


On March 19, 1995, at
around eight oâclock in the evening, Perfecto went looking for Lobrigo and
found him drinking with about five or seven companions.  Seeing him, Perfecto told him to go home
because âhis children were crying.â


Vexed for having lost
face as he was berated by his father-in-law, Lobrigo hit Perfecto with a piece
of wood as soon as Perfecto turned his back.  Immediately, Lobrigoâs drinking buddies followed suit and started to box
and maul Perfecto.
[2]
 They stabbed Perfecto  twice, once on the left side of his stomach
and again near his right armpit. Other than Lobrigo, Perfectoâs assailants were
not immediately identified.


Later that same evening,
doctors at the Dr. Jose Rodriguez Memorial  Hospital,  Tala, Kalookan City
pronounced Perfecto dead on arrival.


The cause of death was
âhemorrhage as a result of stab woundâs, body.â
[3]


On April 7, 1995, Dr. Ma.
Cristina B. Freyra, a medico-legal expert, submitted report on the body of
Perfecto, to wit:
[4]


âFINDINGS:

âCONCLUSION:


âCause of death is hemorrhage as a result of stab wounds, body.â
[5]


On September 22, 1995,
Prosecutor Filomeno A. Bajar of Kalookan City filed with the Regional Trial
Court, Kalookan City an Information for murder
[6]
 against accused Lobrigo and five (5)  John Does.  We quote:


âThat on or about the 19th day of March, 1995 in Kalookan City, MM.
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, without any
justifiable cause, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident
premeditation, and taking advantage of their superior strenght (
sic
),
did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, maul, hit/the
head with a piece of wood and stab with a bladed instrument of the left side of
the body of one, PERFECTO JAEN Y OLLERO, thereby inflicting upon the latter
serious physical injuries, which injuries, which injuries ultimately caused the
victimâs death upon arrival at the Jose N. Rodriguez Hospital, Tala, this city.


âContrary to Law.â
[7]


Before the trial court
could arraign accused Lobrigo, Perfectoâs widow filed a motion for
reinvestigation.
[8]


During reinvestigation
held approximately a year after the actual crime occurred, the complainant
presented Domingo M. Berguro, an eyewitness who identified accused Gregorio,
Dominador, Teodorico and Jimmy Bustillo,
[9]
 Efraim Rosales and Gregorio Jabonero as the
ones who participated with Lobrigo in the stabbing of Perfecto.
[10]


On December 5, 1996, 2nd
Asst. City Prosecutor Rosa C. Reyes of Kalookan City filed with 1st Asst. City
Prosecutor Rosario J. Silverio a memorandum recommending that an amended
information be filed against Gregorio, Dominador, Teodorico, Jimmy Bustillo,
Efraim Rosales and Jimmy Jabonero, as accused in Ciriminal Case No. C-49395.
[11]


On January 9, 1997, the
prosecution amended the information
[12]
 to name accused Gregorio, Dominador and
Teodorico, Jimmy Bustillo, Gil Jerusalem and Efraim Rosales in the charge of
murder.  We quote and underscore the
amendments, to wit:


âThat on or about the 19th day of March, 1995 in Kalookan City,
MM., and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, 
the above named
accused, conspiring and confederating with one another
, without any
justifiable cause, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident
premeditation, and taking advantage of their superior strength, did then and
there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, maul, hit the head with a
piece of wood and stab with a bladed instrument of the left said (
sic
)
of the body of one, PERFECTO JAEN Y OLLERO, thereby inflicting upon the latter
serious physical injuries, which injuries ultimately caused the victimâs death
upon arrival at the Jose N. Rodriguez Hospital, Tala, this city.


âContrary to Law.â
[13]


On January 9, 1997, the
trial court admitted the amended information.
[14]


On May 22, 1997, the
trial court arraigned Jimmy Bustillo, Teodorico, Gregorio and Dominador with
the assistance of counsel 
de oficio
.  They all pleaded ânot guilty.â
[15]
 Trial ensued.


After due trial, on
November 28, 1997, the trial court rendered a decision, the dispositive portion
of which reads:


âWHEREFORE, the prosecution having established to a moral certainty
the guilt of the Accused DOMINADOR INDOY, TEODORICO INDOY, JIMMY BUSTILLO alias
JIMMY BUSTILLOS and GREGORIO JABONERO this Court in the absence of any generic
aggravating or mitigating circumstances hereby sentences each of them to suffer
the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to indemnify the heirs of Victim the
amount of P50,000.00; to pay jointly and severally the said heirs moral and
exemplary damages in the sum of  P100,000.00, with costs against the accused.


âThe case as against Accused RONALDO LOBRIGO, GIL JERUSALEM and
EFRAIM ROSALES
[16]


is ordered archived without prejudice
to its revival if they are arrested later on.


âSO ORDERED.â
[17]


Only accused Gregorio,
Dominador, and Teodorico interposed an appeal.
[18]


We shall review the
factual circumstances surrounding the participation and culpability of
Gregorio, Dominador and Teodorico in the murder of Perfecto.


We find the appeal of
accused-appellants Gregorio and Dominador partly meritorious. However, we find
Teodoricoâs appeal untenable.


In convicting Gregorio,
Dominador and Teodorico of murder, the trial court heavily relied on the
testimonies of Noel Mercader (hereafter, âNoelâ), a former employee of Perfecto
[19]
 and Domingo M. Berguro (hereafter,
âDomingoâ).
[20]


The Case against Gregorio


According to Noel, an
eyewitness to the crime, Gregorio merely boxed Perfecto.  Noel explicitly stated that Gregorio used
his bare hands and was not carrying any weapon at the time.
[21]


On the other hand,
Domingo, also an eyewitness, testified that Gregorio whipped Perfecto several
times with the buckle of his belt.
[22]


The Case against Dominador


Noel testified that
Dominador boxed Perfecto with his bare hands.  According to Noel, Dominador was not carrying a weapon at the time.
[23]
 However, Domingo testified that Dominador
hit Perfecto with a piece of wood.
[24]


The Case against Teodorico


Noel categorically
identified Teodorico as one of the two
[25]
 who stabbed Perfecto under his right armpit.
[26]
 Noel stated that Teodorico used his right
hand when he stabbed Perfecto.
[27]
 Domingo testified that he saw Bustillo stab
Perfecto at his left side.  He did not
see Teodorico stab Perfecto.
[28]


The Courtâs Ruling


We note that the
testimonies of witnesses with respect to Gregorioâs and Dominadorâs
participation in the crime conflict on material points.  


Doubt exists as to
whether Gregorio and Dominador were carrying weapons during the mauling and
whether they participated in the mauling by more than just boxing the
victim.  Noel stated that they did not,
Domingo stated that they did. 


In conspiracy, evidence
as to who administered the fatal blow is not necessary.
[29]
 In this case, the rule is not applicable
because conspiracy with respect to Gregorio and Dominador is not proven.  Their exact participation in the crime is
uncertain. 


The rule is that when an
accusedâs participation in the crime is uncertain, he is given the benefit of
the doubt and may be declared as a mere accomplice therein.
[30]
 In the absence of evidence as to how exactly
the co-accused participated in the crime, conspiracy cannot be attributed
against them.
[31]
 They cannot be held liable as
principals.  The lesser form of
liability prevails.
[32]


An accomplice is one who
knew the criminal design of the principal and knowingly or intentionally
participated therewith by an act which even if not rendered, the crime would be
committed just the same.
[33]
 This is the nature of the acts that Gregorio
and Dominador committed.  Their acts of
repeatedly boxing Perfecto were either previous or simultaneous to the
stabbing,
[34]
 even without which the crime of murder still
would have been committed.


However, Teodoricoâs
appeal lacks merit. Noel categorically identified him as one of those who
stabbed Perfecto.  Noelâs description of
the manner Teodorico committed the crime is detailed and unequivocal.


Further, there is no
reason to doubt Noelâs grave accusation against Teodorico.  The fact that Domingo did not see Teodorico
stab Perfecto is of no moment.  Noelâs
positive testimony prevails over Domingoâs negative one.  In other words, the fact that Domingo did
not see Teodorico stab Perfecto did not mean that Teodorico did not do it, but
simply that Domingo did not witness it.  


Noel and Domingoâs
testimonies with respect to Teodoricoâs participation do not contradict each
other.  Noel narrated that Teodorico
stabbed Perfecto under his right armpit, while Domingo stated that accused
Bustillo stabbed Perfecto on the left side.  Domingo did not say that accused Bustillo alone stabbed Perfecto
twice.  In effect, Noel was the only
eyewitness to Teodoricoâs actual participation.  We have held time and time again that the testimony of a single
witness if positive and credible, is sufficient to sustain a conviction for
murder.
[35]


Besides, we do not think
that Noel would accuse Teodorico of such a grave offense if it were not
true.  If an accused really had nothing
to do with the crime, it would be against  the  natural  order of events and of human nature, and
against the presumption of good faith, for a prosecution witness to falsely
testify against him.
[36]


Teodoricoâs act of
stabbing Perfecto indicates a direct participation in Perfectoâs murder.  This makes him liable as a principal.
[37]
 We note that the cause of Perfectoâs death
was âhemorrhage as a result of stab wounds.â
[38]


Considering the
foregoing, it was proper to impose upon Teodorico the penalty of 
reclusion
perpetua
.  The penalty for murder
under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code is 
reclusion perpetua
 
to
death
.  In the absence of
aggravating or mitigating circumstance that attended the killing, the imposable
penalty is 
reclusion perpetua
.
[39]


However, we reduce the
penalties imposed on Gregorio and Dominador.  The penalty of an accomplice is one degree lower than that of the
principal, which in murder is 
reclusion temporal
, in its maximum period
to death.
[40]


Further, there is a need
to correct the trial courtâs award of P100,000.00  as  moral  damages.  Under current case law, P50,000.00 is a reasonable amount to award as
moral damages to the heirs of a victim in a murder case.
[41]


The Fallo


WHEREFORE
, the decision of the Regional Trial
Court,  Kalookan City, Branch 127 in
Criminal Case  C-49395, dated November
28, 1997, is AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS:

reclusion temporal
, as
maximum.


(2)  All the accused,
jointly and severally, are ordered to pay to the heirs of Perfecto Ollero Jaen
the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages.
