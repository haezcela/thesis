THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. RENATO C. BACUS, APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




VITUG, J.:


The case before the Court is an ordinary appeal from the decision
of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 14, 7th Judicial Region,
holding Renato C. Bacus guilty of rape and meting on him the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
.  


On 13 October 1997, 37-year old Viminda J. Sudario was sleeping
with her three children at the second floor of their house in Llamas Street,
Cebu City.  At dawn, about four oâclock,
she was roused by a âcommotionâ at the ground floor of the house.  Going down the stairs to investigate, she
was surprised to see the main door ajar.  She was about to reach for the door when a man suddenly grabbed her from
behind.  She asked why, and the latter
replied that he came for her.  The man
hushed her not to say a word or, otherwise, be killed.  He dragged her to the maidâs room where she
came to recognize the intruder to be her neighbor Renato C. Bacus.  With a .45 caliber gun aimed at her, Viminda
was forced to lie on her back.  Again,
she was told not to make any noise.  He
raised her skirt and removed her panties.  Once she was stripped naked, he touched and licked her private
parts.  She suffered his advances as the
gun was still pointed at her and also because she feared for her childrenâs
safety.  He removed his short pants and
ordered her to spread her legs wide open.  He inserted his penis into her vagina and started pumping.  He went on ravishing her for thirty to forty
minutes.  After he had satisfied his
lust, he ordered Viminda to open the gate and he left.  After he was gone, Viminda told her 19-year
old daughter about what had just transpired.


Shortly after daybreak, Viminda reported the incident to the
police.  She said that the intruder
gained entry into the house by removing the window jalousies near the kitchen
and reaching for the door knob.  She was
later brought to Cebu City Medical Center to undergo physical examination.  The findings revealed no fresh lacerations
but she was positive for spermatozoa.  Renato C. Bacus was taken into custody by PO3 Christopher Panes, SPO3
Marvin Belita Mendiola and PO3 Rogelio Racaza Cabonilla of the Mabolo Police
Precinct II.  


Renato C. Bacus was promptly charged with rape in an information
that read:


âThat on or about the 13
th
 day of October 1997 at about
4:00 A.M., in the City of Cebu, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the said accused, armed with a gun, with deliberate intent,
using force and intimidation, did then and there willfully and unlawfully have
carnal knowledge with the undersigned, against her will.â
[1]


The accused entered a plea of ânot
guiltyâ when arraigned.  


Controverting the testimony given by Viminda, Renato C. Bacus
pictured an altogether different version of the incident.  He testified that he arrived home in Llamas
Street, Cebu, at around two oâclock on the morning of 13 October 1997, from his
parentsâ house in Talisay, Cebu.  He was
about to enter his house when he heard a whistle or â
sitsit
.â  Turning his head,
he saw Viminda.  Asked why she was still
awake at that late hour, Viminda replied that it was hot inside the house and
she needed to get some fresh air.  Minutes after a brief conversation, she invited him to come in to the
house, assuring him that her live-in partner was not around.  He obliged.  She offered her Tanduay Rhum but he declined, telling her that he had
taken enough beer earlier that evening.  Viminda suddenly embraced him.  She was so fervid that he even told her to slow down.  He also asked for a loan, and she agreed to
lend him P500.00.  She went up the
stairs and told him to wait.  Moments
later, Viminda descended in her skimpy apparel without any underwear and went
to the comfort room to douche herself.  She left the door open so that he could see her while she was freshening
up.  She later emerged from the restroom
and started hugging him.  Viminda pulled
him into the maidâs quarter, and it was there where he finally succumbed to her
lure.  The lovemaking lasted for about
forty minutes after first indulging themselves in âforeplay.â  


Fe Cabanada Abayan, the mother of his live-in partner, Venus
Abayan, testified that Viminda and Renato were actually lovers and carrying on
since September of 1997.  Often, Fe
Abayan said, she would see Viminda and Renato affectionately holding each
other.


Failing to be convinced by the defense, the trial court gave the
case for the prosecution.  The court 
a quo
 held:


âWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, JUDGMENT
is hereby rendered convicting the accused of the crime charged and he is hereby
imposed or punished by a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua.  The accused is further directed to indemnify
the victim moral damages in the sum of P50,000.00 plus costs.â
[2]


In his appeal to this Court, appellant would insist that he
should not be held responsible because the actuations of Viminda before and
during the act of intercourse, including their âforeplay,â were simply
incongruous with the idea of rape.  Claiming that the filing of the rape charge was an afterthought, the
original complaint lodged with the police being one for robbery, appellant
would point to the propensity of Viminda to lie.  He recited an inconsistency in her affidavit where she stated
that she called up the police authorities as early as four-thirty in the
morning on 13 October 1997 but, later in her testimony in court, she said that
it was not until eight oâclock in the morning when she went to the police station.


In reviewing rape cases, the Court has, like before, been guided
by the reality that an accusation for rape can be made with facility; that it
is difficult to prove but even more difficult for an accused, although
innocent, to disprove; and that by the peculiar nature of the crime, it is,
more often than not, only the accused and the complainant who can give
testimony on the incident.  Great care
must thus be exercised in the scrutiny of testimonial evidence given by the
parties.  It should also stand to reason
that the findings of the trial court on the credibility of the witnesses are to
be accorded great weight for the trial judge, obviously, would be in a better
position to personally perceive from the witnesses the veracity of their
asseverations and see the thin line between fact and prevarication.
[3]




Perusing the records and guided by the above principles, the
Court fails to find any cogent justification to make it ignore the assessment
of the trial court on the conflicting asseverations made before it.  Neither does the Court see flaws in the
statements made by private complainant on the witness stand which, on the
contrary, appear to be particularly candid and straightforward.  Viminda Sudario has testified thusly:


âQ -
 
On October 13, 1997 at
about 4:00 oâclock in the morning, can you recall where [you were]?

downstairs, I noticed that the main door was already opened.


âQ - So, when you noticed that the main door was [open], what did
you do?


âA - 
 
I was about to close the
door when suddenly a person embraced me from my back and poked a gun at my
head.


âQ -
 
And what was your
immediate reaction?


âA - 
 
I asked whatâs happening
(
unsa man ni
), whatâs this.


âQ -
 
And was there any reply
from that person who raped you?


âA - 
 
He said do not make any
[sound] if you donât want to die because my intention is you only.


âQ -
 
And what did he do next?


âA -
  
He held me towards the
[maidâs] room.


âQ -
 
By the way, is that
portion of your house lighted?

In the dining table
there is a circular light there, which we intentionally [leave] on throughout
the night.


âQ -
 
Were you able to see the
face of that person who pointed a gun at you?


âA -
  
When he was already
dragging me, holding me at my side, I saw his face.


âQ -
 
Were you able to identify
him?


âA -
  
Yes, because he is a
neighbor.


âQ -
 
Is that person inside the
court room now?


âA -
  
Yes, sir.


âQ -
 
Will you please point to
him?


âINTERPRETER:


(Witness pointed to the accused who responded to the name Renato
Bacus.)


âPROS. SOLIMA:


âQ -
 
You said that he is your
neighbor?


âA -

adjacent to my house.

[maidâs] room, what did he do?


âA -
  
He pushed me on the bed,
saying lie down.


âQ -
 
And what happened to you?


âA -
  
And he was pointing his
gun at me and he pulled up my skirt or raised my skirt.


âQ -
 
Then, what did he do
next?


âA - 
 
He removed my panty.


âQ -
 
Did you not shout?


âA -
  
No, Sir.


âQ -
 
Why not?


âA -
  
I did not shout because
the gun was poked at me and I was also afraid that if I will shout my children
maybe [awakened] and the suspect might panic and he might [draw] on shooting
rampage.


âCOURT:


âQ -
 
Did you resist him?


âA -
  
[It was] in my mind to
resist but I was afraid of the gun and I was also after the safety of my
children.


âQ -
 
Did you display any
active physical resistance to his evil intentions?


âA -
  
I did not although it
was in my mind, because I was frightened and I was thinking of my daughter that
could have been raped so I just did nothing.

âQ -
 
After the accused removed
your pantry, what did he do next?


âA -
  
He did cunnilungus on me
and he touched different parts of my body and afterwards he removed his pants.


âCOURT:


âQ -
 
Did you allow him to do
those things to you without putting any fight?


âA -
  
Everytime I tried to
move he pushed the gun to me and when I tried to say something, he stopped [me
by] saying â[shut] up.â


âQ -
 
How did you react to
those actions [of] the accused?


âA -
  
Nothing because my mind
was pre-occupied with a thought of bloody massacre already in that situation.


âCOURT:


Continue.


âPROS. SOLIMA:


âQ -
 
Did you not kick him?


âA -
  
No, Sir.


âQ -
 
Why not?


âA -
  
He might shoot me.


âCOURT:


âQ -
 
Did you really believe
that he might kill you at that time?


âA -
  
Yes, I even thought that
his primary intention was to kill somebody because we had a long standing
grudge because there was an incident before [where] I filed a case against his
wife for physical injuries, death threats and oral defamation.


âQ -
 
How did these things
happen?


âA -
  
Because that place where
we live is sort of a compound and were occupied by the Abayan families.  I am the only one who is not their relative
there.  I was even to sell that house to
Judge Jacinto but the children of Judge Jacinto suffered injuries from the
hands of the children of the [residents] there.


âCOURT:


Continue.


âPROS. SOLIMA:


âQ -
 
After the accused removed
his short pants what did he do next?


âA -
  
He inserted his penis
into my vagina and then he performed the push and pull movement.


âQ -
 
How did he insert his
penis into your vagina?


âA -
  
He inserted it.


âQ -
 
You did not resist?


âA -
  
No, I just cried.


âCOURT:


âQ -
 
But did you put up any
resistance?


âA -
  
No, because everytime I
tried to move he pressed the gun to my head.


âQ -
 
I am just curious Mrs.
Sudario, how was the accused able to perform the sexual act while he was
pointing a gun at your head?


âCOURT:


Will you please demonstrate it to the court how he was able to
perform the sexual act, when a gun was pointing to your head.


âA -
  
I was lying on the bed
and he ordered me to spread my legs and then he inserted his penis and started
to pump up and down while I was lying (as demonstrated by the witness) he held
on his right hand a gun and everytime I made some movements he would put back
the gun towards my head.


COURT:


Continue.


âPROS. SOLIMA:


âQ -
 
Were you able to identify
the firearm he was holding?


âA -
  
I believe that to be a
[.45] cal. because I have also seen a gun owned by my friends.

âCOURT:


âQ -
 
You mean to say he abused
you thirty to forty minutes on top of you?


âA -
  
No, because he did not
perform the sexual act immediately but he did the foreplay to me.


âCOURT:


Continue.


âPROS. SOLIMA:


âQ -
 
After he raped you, what
did he do next?


âA -
  
He said open the gate because
Iâm going out.


âCOURT:


âQ -
 
Did you obey him?


âA -
  
Yes, Sir, I opened the
gate, while at the gate I thought of running away and calling for help but I
also thought of my children that he might hold hostages, so when I opened the
door, waiting and immediately after I opened the main gate he also proceeded to
get out from the gate.


âCOURT:


Continue.


âPROS. SOLIMA:


âQ -
 
After that, what did you
do?


âA -
  
When I returned inside
the house, I fell to the floor, because my body felt numb, I went upstairs to
verify my daughter and I saw my daughter sleeping on the sofa, instead of her
bed and I told her that I was raped.â
[4]


The lack of tenacity by a rape victim in resisting sexual
aggression does not necessarily mean consent or voluntary submission to the
criminal act.  Neither law nor
jurisprudence requires such kind of obstinacy on the part of the victim to
establish rape, particularly if the defiance becomes futile or would pose undue
risk to herself or her family.  Nor
would the âforeplayâ alluded to by the complainant
[5]
 be
connotative of such consent or voluntariness.  Foreplay is to induce sexual stimulation leading to intercourse,
[6]

and it is what she described appellant, not she, to have done before
consummating his lust.  


Contrary to the claim of appellant, there is no serious
inconsistency between the statements of private complainant in her affidavit
and her testimony in open court.
[7]
 In
any event, sworn statements are often incomplete and unreliable because of
partial suggestions or want of inquiries by investigators, and its variance
from the testimony made during the trial would almost invariably not affect the
credibility of the witness.
[8]

Appellant posits that one of the essential requisites in a successful
prosecution for rape should be the police blotter, and if it is not exhibited
during the trial, one should entertain serious doubt on the credibility of the
complainant in her testimony.
[9]
 The
police blotter, which merely records complaints or incidents in a most
abbreviated manner, can even be less consequential than an affidavit.  It should not be unusual for any victim of
rape to initially report as little as possible about the incident to the police
authorities and to be reluctant in freely submitting herself to an extensive
scrutiny and inquiry.   


Appellant claims that the rape charge has been fabricated.  The contention is not believable.  Viminda is the mother of three children,
including a teenage daughter in a nursing school, and she could not have been
so callous as to expose herself and her family to a possible lifetime of shame
if it were not for a just and lawful cause.  


The Court, all told, is persuaded that the trial court has not
erred in its judgment convicting appellant.  


Under Republic Act 8353, now embodied in the first paragraph of
Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, rape is committed by a man who shall
have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: (a) 
through force, threat or intimidation
;
(b) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; (c)
by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and (d) when
the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even
though none of the circumstances above be present.  The crime is punished by 
reclusion
perpetua
.
[10]


Conformably, with the prevailing jurisprudence, appellant should
also be held liable for a civil indemnity of P50,000.00 in addition to the
P50,000.00 moral damage already decreed by the trial court.


WHEREFORE
, the judgment of the court 
a quo 
finding appellant Renato C. Bacus guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 is AFFIRMED.  In addition to the award of P50,000.00 moral damages, appellant is
likewise ordered to pay P50,000.00 civil indemnity to private complainant
Viminda J. Sudario.  Costs against
appellant.


SO ORDERED.
