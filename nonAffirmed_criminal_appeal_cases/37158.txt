[ G.R. No. 125498, February 18, 1999 ]


CONRADO B. RODRIGO, JR., ALEJANDRO A. FACUNDO AND REYNALDO G. MEJICA, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN (FIRST DIVISION), OMBUDSMAN AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS. 
D E C I S I O N




KAPUNAN, J.:


Petitioners Conrado B. Rodrigo and Reynaldo G. Mejica are the Mayor and Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator, respectively, of San Nicolas, Pangasinan, while petitioner Alejandro A. Facundo is the former Municipal Treasurer of the same municipality.
On 15 June 1992, the Municipality of San Nicolas, represented by Mayor Rodrigo, entered into an agreement with Philwood Construction, represented by Larry Lu, for the electrification of Barangay Caboloan, San Nicolas, for the sum of P486,386.18, requiring:
 Installation of the two (2) units diesel power generator (20) KVA, 220 W, Battery start and other accessories);
 Installation of 24 rolls feeder lines with nos. 6, 8 and ten wires;
 Installation of 40 units 4 x 4 wooden post with accessories; and
 Construction of powerhouse with concrete foundation double throw safety switches (double pole, 250 amperes capacity of 220 V with fuse).
[1]
On 2 September 1992, Mejica, the Planning and Development Coordinator of San Nicolas, prepared an Accomplishment Report stating that the Caboloan Power Generation project was 97.5% accomplished. Said report was supposedly approved by mayor Rodrigo and confirmed by Larry Lu. On the basis of said report, payment of P452,825.53 was effected by the Municipal Treasurer, petitioner Facundo, to Philwood Construction.
On 14 August 1993, petitioners received a Notice of Disallowance dated 21 June 1993 from the Provincial Auditor of Pangasinan, Atty. Agustin Chan, Jr., who found that as per COA (Commission on Audit) evaluation of the electrification project, only 60.0171% of the project (equivalent to P291,915.07) was actually accomplished. Of the two units of generator supposedly purchased, only one second-hand unit was delivered. The same generator broke down after only two nights of operation. In addition, instead of 40 wooden posts, only 27 were installed. The powerhouse was only 65.635% completed. The Provincial Auditor thus disallowed the amount of P160,910.46.
The graph below serves to illustrate the conflicts between Mejica's report and the COA's:

 (difference) 
 
 
In September 1993, petitioners requested the Provincial Auditor to lift the notice of disallowance
[2]
 and to re-inspect the project.
[3]
 Petitioners reiterated their plea in a letter to the Provincial Auditor dated 3 November 1993,
[4]
 attaching therewith a "Certificate of Acceptance and Completion"
[5]
 signed by Clemente Arquero, Jr., Barangay Captain of Caboloan, and Eusebio Doton, President of the Cabaloan Electric Cooperative. The Provincial Auditor, however, allegedly did not act on petitioners' requests.
On 10 January 1994, the Provincial Auditor filed a criminal complaint for estafa before the Ombudsman against petitioners. Likewise impleaded were Larry Lu and Ramil Ang, President and General Manager, and Project Engineer, respectively, of Philwood Construction.
On 10 June 1995, Acting Ombudsman Francisco Villa approved the filing of an information against petitioners for violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. 3019
[6]
 before the 
Sandiganbayan
.
On 28 July 1995, petitioners filed a motion for reinvestigation before the 
Sandiganbayan
. The 
Sandiganbayan
 granted said motion in an Order dated 22 April 1996.
On 7 November 1995, the Office of the Special Prosecutor issued a memorandum recommending that the charges against petitioners be maintained. The Ombudsman approved said memorandum.
Petitioners thereafter filed before the 
Sandiganbayan
 a motion to quash the information alleging, as grounds therefor that (1) the facts alleged in the information did not constitute an offense, and (2) the same information charged more than one offense. Petitioners, however, did not elaborate on these grounds. They instead faulted the Provincial Auditor for instituting the complaint against them notwithstanding the pendency of their opposition to the notice of disallowance. They also argued that the evidence against them did not establish the element of damage nor the presence of any conspiracy between them.
The 
Sandiganbayan
 denied said motion in an Order dated 18 March 1996.
On 18 March 1996, the prosecution moved to suspend petitioners 
pendente lite.
 Petitioners opposed the motion on the ground that the 
Sandiganbayan
 lacked jurisdiction over them. In a Resolution dated 2 July 1996, the 
Sandiganbayan
 ruled that it had jurisdiction over petitioners and ordered the suspension of petitioners 
pendente lite.
Petitioners thus filed before this Court the instant petition for 
certiorari
 under Rule 65, praying that the Court annul: (a) the order of the 
Sandiganbayan
 denying petitioners' motion to quash, and (b) the resolution of the same court upholding its jurisdiction over petitioners. Petitioners likewise prayed that this Court issue a temporary restraining order to enjoin the 
Sandiganbayan
 from proceeding with the case.
On 28 August 1998, the court resolved to issue the temporary restraining order prayed for.
Petitioners allege the following grounds in support of their petition:
I
THE 
SANDIGANBAYAN
 ERRED IN ALLOWING THE LITIGATION OF THE CRIMINAL INFORMATION FOR CONSPIRACY IN VIOLATING SECTION 3(E) OF THE ANTI- GRAFT ACT (R.A. 3019) WHEN THE NOTICE OF DISALLOWANCE STILL PENDS WITH THE PROVINCIAL AUDITOR UNDER PETITIONER' PROTEST SUPPORTED BY CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE REQUIRED ELEMENT OF 'CAUSING UNDUE INJURY TO ANY PARTY, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT' AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE.
II
THE 
SANDIGANBAYAN
 HAS NO JURISDICTION TO PROCEED AGAINST ALL THE PETITIONERS AND ALL THE PROCEEDINGS THEREIN, PARTICULARLY THE ORDER OF SUSPENSION FROM OFFICE 
PENDENTE LITE
, ARE NULL AND VOID 
AB INITIO
.
III
THE ONGOING PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE 
SANDIGANBAYAN
 IS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF THE PETITIONERS UNDER THE 
DUE PROCESS CLAUSE
 AS IT WAS PRECEDED BY HASTY, MALICIOUS, SHAM AND HASTY PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INEVITABLY EXPOSING THEM TO A PROLONGED ANXIETY, AGGRAVATION, EXPENSES, AND HUMILIATION OF A PUBLIC TRIAL.
IV
THE PRECIPITATE 
SANDIGANBAYAN
 ORDER OF SUSPENSION IS A LEGAL ERROR AS THE SAME EVIDENTLY THE LACK OF THE REQUIRED 
COLD NEUTRALITY OF AN IMPARTIAL TRIBUNAL 
VIOLATING PETITIONERS' CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS UNDER THE 
DUE PROCESS CLAUSE
 AND BILL OF RIGHTS.
[7]
The first ground raises two issues: (1) whether petitioners' right to due process was violated by the filing of the complaint against them by the Provincial Auditor, and (2) whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in filing the information against petitioners. The second questions the jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
 over petitioners. The third and fourth grounds are related to the first and are subsumed thereunder.
After a meticulous scrutiny of petitioners' arguments, we find the petition devoid of merit.
I
Petitioners contend that the institution by the Provincial Auditor of the complaint despite the pendency of their opposition to the notice of disallowance violates their right to due process. They submit that "the issuance of a notice of disallowance against (them) compels the provincial auditor to either accept a settlement or adjudicate and decide on 
`the written explanation for the purpose of lifting/settling the suspension or extending the time to answer beyond the ninety (90) day period prior to its conversion into a disallowance."'
[8]
The italicized portion above is an excerpt from Section 44.6.4 of the State Audit Manual, which states in full:
Sec. 44.6.4. Auditor's Responsibility re Evaluation of Disallowance. - It shall be the responsibility of the auditor to exercise professional judgment in evaluating, on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each case as well as the pertinent provisions of applicable laws, rules and regulations, the grounds for a charge or suspension/disallowance of an account or transaction.
It shall be the responsibility of the auditor to exercise sound judgment in evaluating 
the written explanation of the accountable/responsible/liable officer concerned for the purpose of lifting the suspension or extending the time to answer beyond the ninety (90) day period prior to its conversion into a disallowance.
 (Underscoring supplied.)
The aforequoted provision should be read in conjunction with Section 82 of the State Audit Code,
[9]
 which states that:
(a) charge of suspension which is not satisfactorily explained within ninety days after receipt or notice by the accountable officer concerned shall become a disallowance, unless the Commission or auditor concerned shall, in writing and for good cause shown, extend the time for answer beyond ninety days.
At this point, it may be useful to distinguish between a disallowance and a suspension. A 
disallowance
 is the disapproval of a credit or credits to an account/accountable officer's accountability due to non-compliance with law or regulations.
[10]
 Thus, the auditor may disallow an expenditure/transaction which is unlawful or improper.
[11]
A 
suspension
, on the other hand, is the deferment of action to debit/credit the account/accountable officer's accountability pending compliance with certain requirements.
[12]
 A notice of suspension is issued on transactions or accounts which could otherwise have been settled except for some requirements, like lack of supporting documents or certain signatures. It is also issued on transactions or accounts the legality/propriety of which the auditor doubts but which he may later allow after satisfactory or valid justification is submitted by the parties concerned.
[13]
As stated in Section 82, 
supra
, however, the suspension shall become a disallowance if the charge of suspension is "not satisfactorily explained within ninety days after receipt or notice by the accountable officer concerned." The ninety-day period within which the accountable officer may answer the charge of suspension may nevertheless be extended by the Commission or the auditor for "good cause shown."
Clearly, petitioners misinterpreted Section 44.6.4. First, petitioners were not charged with 
suspension
 but 
disallowance.
 Second, the "written explanation" referred to in said section is "for the purpose of lifting the suspension or extending the time to answer beyond the ninety (90) day period prior to its conversion into a disallowance," 
not
 for contesting a disallowance, as petitioners wrongfully assert. Section 44.6.4., therefore, finds no application in this case.
On the other hand, respondents correctly invoke Sections 55 and 56 of Commission on Audit Circular No. 85-156-B, which respectively provide:
SECTION 55. REPORTING FRAUD/UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES
If after evaluation of the findings, the auditor is convinced that the evidence sufficiently discloses the fraud and other unlawful activities and identifies the perpetrators thereof, he shall prepare the sworn statements of the examining witnesses and/or other witnesses and make a report to the Manager/Regional Director concerned, attaching thereto copies of the pertinent affidavits and other supporting documents.
SECTION 56. INSTITUTION OF CRIMINAL ACTION
If criminal prosecution is warranted, the Regional Director/Manager concerned with respect to National Government Agencies/government Owned or Controlled Corporations or Provincial/City Auditors with respect to local government units shall prepare a letter-complaint and file the same with the Tanodbayan or the local deputized Tanodbayan prosecutor within ten (10) days from receipt of the report from the examining auditor, attaching thereto copies of the sworn statements or affidavits of witnesses and other pertinent documents.
Section 56 imposes upon the Provincial Auditor the duty to file a complaint before the Tanodbayan (now the Ombudsman) when, from the evidence obtained during the audit, he is convinced that "criminal prosecution is warranted." The Provincial Auditor need not resolve the opposition to the notice of disallowance and the motion for re-inspection pending in his office before he institutes such complaint so long as there are sufficient grounds to support the same. The right to due process of the respondents to the complaint, insofar as the criminal aspect of the case is concerned, is not impaired by such institution. The respondents will still have the opportunity to confront the accusations contained in the complaint during the preliminary investigation. They may still raise the same defenses contained in their motion to lift the disallowance, as well as other defenses, in the preliminary investigation. Should the Provincial Auditor later reverse himself and grant respondents' motions, or should the COA, or this Court, subsequently absolve them from liability during the pendency of the preliminary investigation, the respondents may ask the prosecuting officer to take cognizance of such decision. The prosecuting officer may then accord such decision its proper weight.
It bears stressing that the exoneration of respondents in the audit investigation does not mean the automatic dismissal of the complaint against them. The preliminary investigation, after all, is independent from the investigation conducted by the COA, their purposes distinct from each other. The first involves the determination of the fact of the commission of a crime; the second relates to the administrative aspect of the expenditure of public funds.
[14]
Accordingly, we hold that the Ombudsman did not err in entertaining the complaint filed by the Provincial Auditor against petitioners, nor the 
Sandiganbayan
 in allowing trial to proceed, despite the pendency of petitioners' motions before the auditor.
II
Petitioners argue that their opposition to the disallowance, supported as it is by a certificate of acceptance and completion, would betray the absence of the elements of evident bad faith or negligence, and damage. They likewise claim that the evidence does not establish conspiracy among them.
The presence or absence of the elements of the crime, however, is evidentiary in nature and is a matter of defense, the truth of which can be best passed upon after a full-blown trial on the merits.
[15]
 The same applies to the alleged absence of any conspiracy between the accused.
This Court, moreover, has maintained a consistent policy of non-interference in the determination of the Ombudsman regarding the existence of probable cause, provided there is no grave abuse in the exercise of such discretion.
[16]
 In a recent decision,
[17]
 this Court, quoting 
Young vs. Office of the Ombudsman
,
[18]
 stated the rationale for this rule:
... The rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, the functions of the court will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions assailing the dismissal of investigatory proceedings conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they could be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals or prosecuting attorneys each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant.
Petitioners have failed to establish any such abuse on the part of the Ombudsman.
III
Petitioners next question the jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
. They contend that Mayor Rodrigo occupies a position of Grade 24 and is, therefore, beyond the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
.
Before the passage of Republic Act No. 7975
[19]
 on 30 March 1995, the pertinent portions of section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1606,
[20]
 as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1861,
[21]
 read as follows:
SEC. 4. 
Jurisdiction. -
 The 
Sandiganbayan
 shall exercise:
(a) Exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases involving:
(1) Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act No. 1379, and Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII of the Revised Penal Code;
(2) Other offenses or felonies committed by public officers and employees in relation to their office, including those employed in government-owned or controlled corporations, whether simple or complexed with other crimes, where the penalty prescribed by law is higher than 
prision correccional
 or imprisonment for six (6) years, or a fine of P6,000.00; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that offenses or felonies mentioned in this paragraph where the penalty prescribed by law does not exceed 
prision correccional 
or imprisonment for six (6) years or a fine of P6,000.00 shall be tried by the proper Regional Trial Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court and Municipal Circuit Trial Court.
xxx.
Section 2 of R.A. No. 7975 subsequently redefined the jurisdiction of the Anti-Graft Court such that the pertinent portions of Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606 now reads:
Sec. 4. 
Jurisdiction
. -- the 
Sandiganbayan
 shall exercise original jurisdiction in all cases involving:
a. Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, Republic Act No. 1379, and Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII of the Revised Penal Code, where one or more of the principal accused are officials occupying the following positions in the government, whether in a permanent, acting or interim capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense:
(1) Officials of the executive branch occupying the positions of regional director and higher, otherwise classified as grade "27" and higher, of the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989 (Republic Act No. 6758), specifically including:
(a) Provincial governors, vice-governors, members of the 
sangguniang panlalawigan
 and provincial treasurers, assessors, engineers, and other provincial department heads;
(b) City mayors, vice-mayors, members of the 
sangguniang panlungsod
, city treasurers, assessors, engineers, and other city department heads.
(c) Officials of the diplomatic service occupying the position of consul and higher;
(d) Philippine army and air force colonels, naval captains, and all officers of higher rank;
(e) PNP chief superintendent and PNP officers of higher rank;
(f) City and provincial prosecutors and their assistants, and officials and prosecutors in the Office of the Ombudsman and special prosecutor;
(g) Presidents, directors or trustees, or managers of government-owned or controlled corporations, state universities or educational institutions or foundations;
(2) Members of Congress and officials thereof classified as Grade "27" and up under the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989;
(3) Members of the judiciary without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution;
(4) Chairmen and members of Constitutional Commissions, without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution; and
(5) All other national and local officials classified as Grade "27" and higher under the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989.
b. Other offenses or felonies committed by the public officials and employees mentioned in subsection (a) of this section in relation to their office.
c. Civil and criminal cases filed pursuant to and in connection with Executive Order Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A.
In cases where none of the principal accused are occupying positions corresponding to salary grade "27" or higher, as prescribed in the said Republic Act No. 6758, or PNP officers occupying the rank of superintendent or higher, or their equivalent, exclusive jurisdiction thereof shall be vested in the proper Regional Trial Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court, and Municipal Circuit Trial Court, as the case may be, pursuant to their respective jurisdictions as provided in Batas Pambansa Blg. 129.

Then Associate, now Chief Justice, Hilario Davide explained the effects of these amendments in 
People vs. Magallanes
:
[22]
As a consequence of these amendments, the 
Sandiganbayan
 partly lost its 
exclusive original jurisdiction
 in cases involving violations of R.A. No. 3019, as amended,
[23]
 as amended; R.A. No. 1379,
[24]
 and Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII of the Revised Penal Code,
[25]
 it retains only cases where the accused are those enumerated in subsection 
a
, Section 4 above and, generally, national and local officials classified as Grade "27" and higher under the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989 (R.A. No. 6758). Moreover, its jurisdiction over other offenses or felonies committed by public officials and employees in relation to their office is no longer determined by the prescribed penalty, 
viz
., that which is higher than 
prision correccional
 or imprisonment for six years or a fine of P6,000.00; it is enough that they are committed by those public officials and employees enumerated in subsection 
a, 
Section 4 above. However, it retains its exclusive original jurisdiction over civil and criminal cases filed pursuant to or in connection with E.O. Nos. 1,
[26]
 2,
[27]
 14,
[28]
 and 14-A.
[29]
The apparent intendment of these amendments is to ease the dockets of the 
Sandiganbayan
 and to allow the Anti-Graft Court to focus its efforts on the trial of those occupying higher positions in government, the proverbial "big fish." Section 4, as amended, freed the 
Sandiganbayan
 from the task of trying cases involving lower-ranking government officials, imposing such duty upon the regular courts instead. The present structure is also intended to benefit these officials of lower rank, especially those residing outside Metro Manila, charged with crimes related to their office, who can ill-afford the expenses of a trial in Metro Manila. As the Explanatory Note of House Bill No. 9825
[30]
 states:
One is given the impression that only lowly government workers or the so-called `small fry' are expediently tried and convicted by the 
Sandiganbayan
. The reason for this is that at present, the 
Sandiganbayan
 has the exclusive and original jurisdiction over graft cases committed by all officials and employees of the government, irrespective of rank and position, from the lowest-paid janitor to the highly-placed government official. This jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
 must be modified in such a way that only those occupying high positions in the government and the military (the big fishes) may fall under its exclusive and original jurisdiction. In this was, the Sandiganbayan can devote its time to big time cases involving the "big fishes" in the government. The regular courts will be vested with the jurisdiction of cases involving less-ranking officials (those occupying positions corresponding to salary grade twenty-seven (27) and below and PNP members with a rank lower than Senior Superintendent. This set-up will prove more convenient to people in the provinces. They will no longer have to travel to Manila to file their complaint or to defend themselves. They can already file their complaint or their defense before the Regional Trial Court or the Municipal Trial Court in their respective localities, as the case may be.
To distinguish the "big fish" from the "small fry," Congress deemed the 27
th
 Grade as the demarcation between those who should come under the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan and those within the regular courts'. (While H.B. No. 9825 originally intended only officials of Grade 28 and above as within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, the resulting law included officials of Grade 27.) Thus, officials occupying positions of Grade 27 and above, charged with crimes referred to in Section 4 a. and b., are within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan; those below come under the jurisdiction of the regular courts.
Although some positions of Grade 27 and above are stated by name in Section 4 a., the position of Municipal Mayor is not among them. Nevertheless, Congress provided a catchall in Section 4 a. (5), thus:
(5) All other national and local officials classified as Grade "27" and higher under the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989.
Such a catchall is necessary, for it would be impractical, if not impossible, for Congress to list down each position created or will be created pertaining to Grades 27 and above.
At present, Volume III of the 1997 edition of the Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades, which was prepared by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) pursuant to Republic Act No. 6758,
[31]
 otherwise known as the "Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989," lists the following positions under Salary Grade 27, including the position of "Municipal Mayor I":
Assistant Commissioner of Internal Revenue
Assistant Regional Cabinet Secretary
Assistant Regional Executive Secretary
Board Member I
Chairman, Police Regional Appellate Board
Chief of Mission, Class II

Earlier, in the 1989 version of the same Index, the Municipal Mayor was also assigned a Salary Grade of 27. It appears, therefore, that petitioner Mayor comes within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.
Petitioners, however, claim that at the time of the commission of the alleged crime on or about 2 September 1992, Mayor Rodrigo, the highest public ranking public official impleaded in this case, was receiving a monthly salary of P10,441.00. Such amount 6758 is supposedly equivalent to a fourth step increment in Grade 24 under the Salary Schedule prescribed in Section 7 of R.A. No. 6758: *
SEC. 7.

Petitioners conclude that Mayor Rodrigo, at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, was occupying a Grade 24 position and, thus, not within the Sandiganbayan's original and exclusive jurisdiction, as defined in Section 2 of R.A. No. 7975.
This is a simplistic, and altogether incorrect, interpretation of the law.
Section 5, Article IX-C of the Constitution provides that:
The Congress shall provide for the standardization of compensation of government officials and employees, including those in government-owned or controlled corporation with original charters, taking into account the nature of the responsibilities pertaining to, and the qualifications required for their positions.
This provision is not unique to the 1987 Constitution. The 1973 Constitution, in Section 6, Article XII thereof, contains a very similar provision pursuant to which then President Marcos, in the exercise of his legislative powers, issued Presidential Decree No. 985.
[32]
However, with the advent of the new Constitution, and in compliance therewith, Congress enacted R.A. No. 6758. Section 2 thereof declares it the policy of the State "to provide equal pay for substantially equal work and to base differences in pay upon substantive differences in duties and responsibilities, and qualification requirements of the positions."
To give life to this policy, as well as the constitutional prescription to "(take) into account the nature of the responsibilities pertaining to, and the qualifications required" for the positions of government officials and employees, Congress adopted the scheme employed in P.D. No. 985 for classifying positions with comparable responsibilities and qualifications for the purpose of according such positions similar salaries. This scheme is known as the "Grade," defined in P.D. No. 985 as:
Includ[ing] all classes of positions which, although different with respect to kind or subject matter of work, are sufficiently equivalent as to level of difficulty and responsibilities and level of qualification requirements of the work to warrant the inclusion of such classes of positions within one range of basic compensation.
[33]
The Grade is therefore a means of grouping positions "sufficiently equivalent as to level of difficulty and responsibilities and level of qualification requirements of the work" so that they may be lumped together in "one range of basic compensation."
Thus, Congress, under Section 8 of R.A. No. 6758, fixed the Salary Grades
[34]
 of officials holding constitutional positions, as follows:
SEC. 8. 
Salaries of Constitutional Officials and their Equivalent
. - Pursuant to Section 17, Article XVIII of the Constitution, the salary of the following officials shall be in accordance with the Salary Grades indicated hereunder:

The Department of Budget and Management is hereby authorized to determine the officials who are of equivalent rank to the foregoing Officials, where applicable, and may be assigned the same Salary Grades based on the following guidelines:
x x x
As indicated in the aforequoted section, Congress delegated the rest of this tedious task (of fixing Salary Grades) to the DBM, subject to the standards contained in R.A. No. 6758, by authorizing the DBM to "determine the officials who are of equivalent rank to the foregoing officials, where applicable," and to assign them the same Salary Grades subject to a set of guidelines found in said section.
[35]
For positions below those mentioned under Section 8, Section 9 directs the DBM to prepare the "Index of Occupational Services" guided by (a) the Benchmark Position prescribed in Section 9,
[36]
 and (b) the following factors:
(1) the education and experience required to perform the duties and responsibilities of the position;
(2) nature and complexity of the work to be performed;

Pursuant to such authority, the DBM drafted the 1989 Index of Occupational Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades, later revised in 1997. In both versions, the position of Municipal Mayor was assigned a Salary Grade 27.
That petitioner received a salary less than that prescribed for such Grade is explained by Sections 10 and 19 (b) of R.A. No. 6758, which respectively provide:
SEC. 10. 
Local Government Units 
(LGUs). -- The rates of pay in LGUs shall be determined on the basis of the class and financial capability of each LGU: 
Provided,
 That such rates of pay shall not exceed the following percentages of the rates in the salary schedule prescribed under Section 7 hereof:

Funding Source. - 
The funding sources for the amounts necessary to implement this Act shall be as follows:
(a) x x x
(b) 
For local government units, the amount shall be charged against their respective funds.
 Local government units which do not have adequate or sufficient funds shall only partially implement the established rates as may be approved by the Joint Commission under Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 1188: 
Provided,
 That any partial implementation shall be uniform and proportionate for all positions in each local government unit: 
Provided further,
 That savings from National Assistance to Local Government Units (NALGU) funds may be used for this purpose.
x x x. (Underscoring supplied.)
Thus, a local government official's actual salary may be less than what the Salary Schedule under Section 7 prescribes, depending on the class and financial capability of his or her respective local government unit. This circumstance, however, has no bearing on such official's Grade. As the foregoing discussion shows, 
on official's salary is determined by the Grade accorded his position, and ultimately by the nature of his position
 - the level of difficulty and responsibilities and level of qualification requirements of the work. To give credence to petitioners' argument that Mayor Rodrigo's salary determines his Grade would be to misconstrue the provisions of R.A. No. 6758, and ignore the constitutional and statutory policies behind said law.
Petitioner mayor's position having been classified as Grade 27 in accordance with R.A. No. 6758, and having been charged with violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019, petitioner is subject to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, as defined by Section 4 a. of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 2 of R.A. No. 7975. By virtue of the same Section 4 a., as amended, his co-accused are also subject to the Anti-Graft Court's jurisdiction.
