MENDOZA, J.:


Petitioners seek a review of the decision of the Court of Appeals in C.A. G.R. SP No. 16106,
[1]

 reversing the ruling of the Regional Trial Court and ordering the 
admission in evidence of petitioner Benedicto Gonzalesâ extrajudicial 
confession and the transcript of the proceedings of the preliminary 
investigation of the case, during which Benedicto allegedly made 
statements affirming the contents of his extrajudicial confession.

The facts are as follows:

Petitioners Melecio Macasiray, Virgilio Gonzales, and Benedicto 
Gonzales are the accused in Criminal Case No. 33(86) of the Regional 
Trial Court of San Jose City, presided over by Judge Pedro C. Ladignon. 
The case is for the murder of Johnny Villanueva, husband of private 
respondent Rosalina Rivera Villanueva, on February 9, 1986. 

It appears that in the course of the trial of the case, the 
prosecution introduced in evidence, as Exhibit B, an extrajudicial 
confession executed by petitioner Benedicto Gonzales on March 27, 1986, 
in which he admitted participation in the crime and implicated 
petitioners Melecio Macasiray and Virgilio Gonzales, his co-accused. 
Also presented in evidence, as Exhibit D, was the transcript of 
stenographic notes taken during the preliminary investigation of the 
case on April 8, 1986 before the fiscalâs office. This transcript 
contained statements allegedly given by Benedicto in answer to questions
 of the fiscal, in which he affirmed the contents of his extrajudicial 
confession.

When the extrajudicial confession was offered at the conclusion 
of the presentation of evidence for the prosecution, petitioners 
objected to its admissibility on the ground that it was given without 
the assistance of counsel. The transcript of the preliminary 
investigation proceeding was similarly objected to on the same ground. 
In its order dated April 14, 1988, the trial court sustained the 
objections and declared the two documents to be inadmissible.

It appears that when it was the turn of the defense to present 
evidence, Gonzales was asked about his extrajudicial confession (Exh. 
B). On cross-examination, he was questioned not only about his 
extrajudicial confession but also about answers allegedly given by him 
during the preliminary investigation and recorded in the transcript of 
the proceeding. As he denied the contents of both documents, the 
prosecution presented them as rebuttal evidence, allegedly to impeach 
the credibility of Gonzales. Petitioners once more objected and the 
trial court again denied admission to the documents. (Order, dated Oct. 
17, 1988)

Private respondent then sought the nullification of the trial 
courtâs orders and succeeded. The Court of Appeals declared the two 
documents admissible in evidence and ordered the trial court to admit 
them. Hence, this petition for review of the appellate courtâs decision.

There is no dispute that the extrajudicial confession and the 
statements recorded in the transcript in question were taken without the
 assistance of counsel. Petitioner Benedicto Gonzales was informed of 
his constitutional rights in a very perfunctory manner. No effort was 
made to drive home to him the seriousness of the situation he was 
facing.
[2]
 He waived the assistance of counsel, but did so without counselâs advice and assistance.
[3]

 Both his confession and his statement before the fiscal were thus 
inadmissible under Art. IV, Â§20 of the 1973 Constitution. The question 
is whether petitioners waived objection to the admissibility of the 
documents, either by failing to object to their introduction during the 
trial or by using them in evidence. In declaring them to be admissible, 
the Court of Appeals said:



The documents in question (Annexes A and B to Petition), which were
 denied admission by respondent Judge, were marked for identification as
 âExh. Bâ with sub-markings and âExh. Dâ with sub-markings on â10-11-86â
 (or October 22, 1986) as appear on their face. Those markings show that
 the documents were introduced during the prosecutionâs 
evidence-in-chief; and, necessarily, they were testified on by a 
prosecution witness (not clear from the record who). The fact that the 
prosecution proposed to formally offer them in evidence at the close of 
trial implies that when the documents were first introduced through the 
prosecution witness at the trial, the defense did not object to their 
introduction. 
To prevent the introduction of such kind of evidence, 
the practice is for the defense to move for its exclusion at any time 
before commencement of trial. Such failure of the defense may therefore 
be taken as a waiver of their objection -- and the waiver was made at 
the trial by said accused who was in fact assisted by counsel
. 


Thus, because of such failure to object, the prosecution succeeded 
to introduce the subject documents and cause them to be marked for 
identification as Exhibits B and D. . . 
  


. . . During the defense turn to present their evidence-in-chief, 
they called said accused to the witness stand, then through him 
introduced the question-and-answer statement (Exh. B) that had 
previously been denied admission by respondent Judge, and on direct 
examination asked him to testify on said statement; of course, accused 
denied the contents in that statement. In other words, 
not only did 
the defense waive their objection to the introduction of this statement 
when first introduced during the prosecutionâs evidence-in-chief as well
 as when introduced through the testimony of Cpl. Renato Bautista given 
during the prosecution evidence-in-rebuttal, the defense themselves -- 
including the counsel for accused -- introduced such statement as part 
of their evidence-in-chief
. Hence, respondent Judge committed a 
grave abuse of discretion in denying admission of this statement (Exh. 
B) when the prosecution again proposed to formally offer it as their 
evidence after the defense had rested. 


With respect to the transcript (Exh. D), however, the defense did 
not introduce it as part of their evidence-in-chief. Although the 
prosecution introduced this exhibit during the cross-examination on 
which said accused was confronted during the latterâs cross-examination,
 the same cannot serve as an independent evidence for the prosecution. 
The exhibit may be admitted as prosecution evidence only for the purpose
 of impeachment, i.e. as a means to test the credibility of said accused
 and/or his testimony. Therefore, respondent Judge should not have 
rejected such transcript (Exh. D) when formally offered by the 
prosecution for that limited purpose of impeachment. In denying this 
exhibit admission, respondent Judge also committed a grave abuse of 
discretion. 


In fine, the introduction and admission of the two documents in question 
per se

 was not violative of Sec. 20 Art. IV of the 1973 Constitution nor of 
Sec. 12, Art. III of the 1987 Constitution. As stated above, with 
respect to the sworn statement (Exh. B), this was introduced by the 
defense themselves at the trial as their evidence-in-chief; hence, in 
effect this became part of their evidence. As regards the transcript 
taken during the preliminary investigation of the complaint against said
 accused and his co-accused (Exh. D), this too was deemed admitted, not 
by a positive act of the defense but by their default for failure to 
object to its introduction at the trial during the cross-examination of 
said accused who was assisted by counsel. (Emphasis added)
  


We think the Court of Appeals erred.
  




First
. Objection to evidence must be made after the evidence is formally offered.
[4]
 In the case of documentary evidence, offer is made after all the witnesses of the party making the offer have testified,
[5]
 specifying the purpose for which the evidence is being offered.
[6]
 It is only at this time, and not at any other, that objection to the documentary evidence may be made.

In this case, petitioners objected to the admissibility of the 
documents when they were formally offered. Contrary to the ruling of the
 appellate court, petitioners did not waive objection to admissibility 
of the said documents by their failure to object when these were marked,
 identified, and then introduced during the trial. That was not the 
proper time to make the objection. âObjection to the documentary 
evidence must be made at the time it is formally offered, not earlier.â
[7]

 Thus, it has been held that the identification of the document before 
it is marked as an exhibit does not constitute the formal offer of the 
document as evidence for the party presenting it. Objection to the 
identification and marking of the document is not equivalent to 
objection to the document when it is formally offered in evidence. What 
really matters is the objection to the document at the time it is 
formally offered as an exhibit.
[8]


It may be mentioned in this connection that in one case,
[9]

 objection to the admissibility of a confession on the ground that no 
meaningful warning of his constitutional rights was given to the accused
 was raised as soon as the prosecution began introducing the confession,
 and the trial judge sustained the objection and right away excluded the
 confession. This Court, through Chief Justice Fernando, upheld the 
action of the trial court over the dissent of Justice Aquino, who argued
 that the trial courtâs ruling was premature, considering that the 
confession was merely being identified. It was not yet being formally 
offered in evidence.
[10]
 On 
the other hand, Justice Barredo, concurring, while agreeing that 
objection to documentary evidence should be made at the time of formal 
offer, nonetheless thought that to faithfully carry out the 
constitutional mandate, objections based on the 
Miranda
 right 
to counsel at the stage of police interrogation should be raised as 
early as possible and the ruling on such objections made just as soon in
 order not to create prejudice in the judge, in the event the confession
 is found inadmissible.
[11]


But the ruling in that case does not detract from the fact that 
objections should be made at the stage of formal offer. Objections to 
the admissibility of documents may be raised during trial and the court 
may rule on them then, but, if this is not done, the party should make 
the objections when the documentary evidence is formally offered at the 
conclusion of the presentation of evidence for the other party. 

Indeed, before it was offered in evidence, the confession in this
 case cannot even be considered as evidence to which the accused should 
object. 

Second
. Nor is it correct to say that the confession was
 introduced in evidence by Benedicto Gonzales himself when it was his 
turn to present evidence for the defense. What happened is that despite 
the fact that in its order of April 14, 1988 the court sustained the 
objection to the admissibility of the confession and the statements 
given by Benedicto Gonzales at the preliminary investigation, the 
defense nonetheless asked him questions regarding his confession in 
reference to his denial of liability. It was thus not for the purpose of
 using as evidence the confession and the alleged statements in the 
preliminary investigation but precisely for the purpose of denying their
 contents that Gonzales was asked questions. Gonzales denied he ever 
gave the answers attributed to him in the TSN allegedly taken during the
 preliminary investigation.

The defense did not really have to ask Gonzales questions 
regarding his confession inasmuch as the court had already declared both
 the confession and the transcript of stenographic notes to be 
inadmissible in evidence, but certainly the defense should not be 
penalized for exercising an abundance of caution. In fact, the defense 
did not mark the confession as one of its exhibits, which is proof of 
the fact that it did not adopt it as evidence. There is, therefore, no 
basis for the appellate courtâs ruling that because the defense adopted 
the confession by introducing it in evidence, the defense waived any 
objection to the admission of the same in evidence.

Third
. Private respondent justifies the use of the 
confession and TSN on the ground that they are necessary for the purpose
 of impeaching the credibility of Benedicto Gonzales and not for the 
purpose of presenting them as evidence in chief. But as already stated, 
there was really no need for Gonzales to deny the contents both of the 
confession and the TSN since they had already been excluded in evidence.
 There was therefore no use for impeaching his credibility.
