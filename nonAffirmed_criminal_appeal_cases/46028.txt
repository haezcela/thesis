PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. AVELINO RELOX, APPELLANT. 
D E C I S I O N




AZCUNA, J.:


This is an appeal from the Decision
[1]
 of Regional Trial Court of Romblon
[2]
 finding appellant Avelino Relox (Avelino) guilty of the crime of rape committed against his own daughter Adela B. Relox (Adela). The trial court sentenced him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
 and to pay P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, plus costs of the suit.
The prosecutionâs first witness was the complainant.
[3]
 At the time of the alleged rape Adela was 33 years old, while her father was 60 years old. Adela testified that in the evening of June 8, 2000, she was in her parentsâ house with her two children, Andrean and Jonadel. Also present in the house were appellant and three of Adelaâs younger siblings. As the house only had one room with no beds, everyone slept side by side on the floor. Adelaâs mother, Natividad, did not sleep with them that night because Avelino ejected her from the house earlier that same evening after an argument.
Adela said that she was awakened when she felt somebody touching her body. When she opened her eyes she saw Avelino sitting beside her, holding and touching her thighs and breast. Adela complained by saying âNo 
tatay
. Why me?â but Avelino answered âYour nanay is not around so it will be the two of us.â Then Avelino pinned both of Adelaâs hands over her head with his left hand and used his right hand to pull down Adelaâs shorts and panty. After that Avelino stood up to remove his shorts. He then pinned Adelaâs thighs with his feet, laid down on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina.
Adela told Avelino â
Tatay
, stop it. Have pity on me,â but the latter paid no attention and continued having sexual intercourse with Adela for about half an hour until Avelino was able to satisfy himself.
The following morning, Adela met her mother at the Municipal Hall and submitted herself to a medical examination. She later executed an Affidavit-Complaint for rape against her father, Avelino.
The prosecutionâs second witness was Natividad Relox, mother of the complainant and wife of Avelino.
[4]
 She merely testified that Avelino is sexually active, despite his age, and that they used to have sex twice a week. She also said that on the night of the alleged rape, Avelino ejected her from the house because they had a fight.
The last witness for the prosecution was Dr. Victoriano F. Benedicto, who conducted the medical examination on Adela.
[5]
 He testified that, in the course of his examination, he noted two areas in the complainantâs vagina that were âraw surfaces.â These meant that the mucous membranes have been slightly skinned out and were a little bit red, which translates to possible sexual intercourse. However, there were negative findings for spermatozoa. As a result, the doctor could not definitely state that Adela had recent sexual intercourse.
The defense presented Avelino as its only witness.
[6]
 In his testimony, Avelino claimed that he could not recall any of the events relating to the alleged rape and had nothing further to state. He was very uncooperative and did not even want to answer the questions of his own counsel and the trial court. He kept reasoning that those things are all in the past, which he had already forgotten.
After trial, appellant was found guilty under the aforestated decision. Hence, the present appeal.
The Court has three guiding principles in reviewing rape cases: 1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility, as it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove; 2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; 3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence of the defense.
[7]
As in most rape cases, appellantâs conviction was chiefly due to the testimony of the complainant and the result of this appeal will naturally depend on the credibility of such testimony. The consistency on material points, or lack of it, can sustain or negate a conviction. Correspondingly, the scrutiny of the account of the complainant becomes even more stringent where a conviction could forfeit the life or the life-long liberty of an accused.

[9]
 including her cross-examination, is reproduced below, as follows:

[11]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q

According to par. 5 of your affidavit [sic] you tried to resist but failed because both your arms were held by your father, is that correct?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q

I already-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
You know what, if this Court will convict the accused and there will be an appeal, the Honorable Supreme Court may acquit the accused because it might say that it is impossible for the accused to be holding both your arms and at the same time pulling your shorts and panty, which is really correct? It is possible but there is a problem there. In that statement, there is a problem in that conclusion. Please translate what the court said to the witness. Proceed.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATTY. GERONIMO continuing:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
You mean to say that by resisting vigorously you are moving your buttocks left and right or up and down?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
 
I was evading him.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
And despite this evasion he was able to penetrate your vagina on the third thrust, is that correct?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
He was firmly holding me and he was even threatening me that he would kill all of us.

By the way, how old is your younger brother Ms. Witness?

And the other one?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
 
Seventeen (17).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
And that seventeen (17) year old younger brother of yours was there at that time?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
They were already asleep.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
What was the distance of that seventeen (17) year old brother of yours from you on that particular day, 2:00 oâclock in the early morning of June 9, 2000?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
It is quite far. From here to that corner (witness pointing to the side of the reelings [sic] of the rostrum from the witness stand which when measured appears to be 3.80 meters).

Q

You did not try to awake your brother while your father was trying to take advantage of you?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
I could not reach for him because I was being held by my Tatay.

-
 
Yes, sir (counsel approached somebody inside the courtroom wearing a white t-shirt).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Court observed that the accused could hardly walk, could hardly stand, could hardly move.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ATTY. GERONIMO continuing:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
You know that he is more than sixty (60) years old now?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
 
I know that already, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
And you are thirty three (33) years old?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A

Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q

And you can see that you are healthier than your father, is that correct?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A

Yes, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
And despite this physical appearance which this Court observed you are telling us that this accused was able to do what he did to you according to you?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
 
Yes sir, because he was strong by then.
 
 
One of the rules observed in examining the testimony of a complainant in rape cases is that it must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but must be credible in itself such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve under the circumstances. Whatever is repugnant to these standards becomes incredible and lies outside judicial cognizance.
[12]
The Court, after an exacting review of Adelaâs testimony, concludes that the crime of rape had not been duly proven.
Rape is a crime that is committed by having carnal knowledge against or without the consent of the victim.
[13]
 While it may be said that tenacious resistance from the victim is not a requirement for the crime of rape, the lack of evidence signifying an obstinate resistance to submit to the intercourse, naturally expected from an unwilling victim, could likewise indicate that no rape has occurred.
[14]
 In this case, the manner by which Adela had claimed she resisted her attacker does not fit with what is naturally expected given the situation she was placed in.
First
, it is incredible that Adela could not put up more resistance against appellant who was already old and unarmed the entire time. The force and intimidation alleged to have been employed are not of such character as to render Adela a helpless victim. As the trial court observed eight months after the alleged rape, the 60-year-old appellant âcould hardly walk, could hardly stand, could hardly move.â  Thus, it is hard to understand why Adela was unable to free her two arms from appellant who was using only one hand to hold them down.
Second
, assuming that her body was pinned down, there was nothing to prevent Adela from screaming in order to wake up the children or dissuade her father from continuing his intention. There was no testimony that her father had gagged her mouth or used a weapon to threaten her with bodily harm should she make noise. When asked if she pleaded with her father to stop, she said she did 
but only in a soft voice
 because, according to her, even if she shouted, nobody would hear and come to help. However, after being reminded that there were children inside the house who could have heard her, she said that she did shout but the children did not wake up.
The Court finds Adelaâs story to be implausible. During that whole thirty-minute ordeal, there was nothing to stop Adela from screaming as loudly as she could.  Hence, if Adela had really made a serious effort to shout for help, it is very unlikely that not one of the five children, the oldest being already 17 years old, would wake up. Also, Adela was particularly asked if she tried to wake up her 17-year-old brother. She claimed that she tried to reach for him but her hands were being held down by appellant. Again, the Court cannot understand why Adela only tried to reach for her brother when she could have attempted to wake him up by screaming.
Third
, even if the Court would give Adela the benefit of the doubt that she was unable to free herself from the one-handed clutch of her father or to wake up the other people in the room, the fact that Adela failed to flee at a moment when she was let go by appellant remains unexplained. According to her testimony, after pulling down her shorts and panty, appellant stood up to remove his shorts. During this interval, Adela did not flee or make another attempt to rouse the children from their sleep. Instead, Adela testified that all she did at the moment was look at her fatherâs penis. Appellant even described how long it was, while laughing at the same time.
It is indeed strange that Adela could only show scant resistance against the alleged assault against her honor. While the law does not impose on the rape victim the burden of proving resistance where force was used on her, Adelaâs narration of the incident is open to serious doubts, which results in the failure by the prosecution to discharge the requisite quantum of evidence that is necessary to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence.
There have been a number of convictions sustained by the Court on the basis of the lone testimony of the complainant. Such testimonies, however, have been found to meet the test of credibility, which means that the testimony should not only come from the mouth of a credible witness but should likewise be credible and reasonable in itself, candid, straightforward and in accord with human experience.
[15]
 These qualities are not present in this case.
In convicting appellant, the trial court applied the doctrinal rule that as between a father and his daughter in incestuous sexual assault, the formerâs moral ascendancy and influence over the latter sufficiently substitutes force and intimidation.  First enunciated in People v. Erardo,
[16]
 the pronouncement was reiterated in a number of cases and recently affirmed in 
People v. Servado.
[17]
 As lucidly explained by the Court in one case:
[18]
In a rape committed by a father against his own daughter, the formerâs moral ascendancy and influence over the latter substitute for violence and intimidation. That ascendancy or influence necessarily flows from the fatherâs parental authority, which the Constitution and the laws recognize, support and enhance, as well as from the childrenâs duty to obey and observe reverence and respect towards their parents. Such reverence and respect are deeply ingrained in the minds of Filipino children and are recognized by law. Abuse of both by a father can subjugate his daughterâs will, thereby forcing her to do whatever he wants.
The reliance upon this doctrine is misplaced.
At the time of the alleged rape, Adela was 33 years old, with children of her own, and no longer under the parental authority of her father. Moreover, being a mother herself, she should already be aware of how immoral and appalling it is to have sexual intercourse with her father so that, no matter how obedient she was when she was a child, she would not have succumbed to her fatherâs advances without a fight.
The bare denials and refusal to answer questions of his counsel and the trial court certainly do not help appellant and present a weak defense. Nevertheless, the prosecutionâs evidence must stand or fall on its own merit and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence of the defense.
[19]
 And while there may have been an affidavit presented by the prosecution, wherein appellant admitted having raped Adela, such was repudiated by appellant who said that he was just asked to sign the affidavit without knowing its contents.
The Court has one last point to make. Upon the defense counselâs failure to elicit from appellant facts necessary for his defense, the trial court attempted to convince appellant to be more cooperative for his own sake. The following is a portion of that exchange between the trial court and appellant:
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The possible penalty here is death. Mr. Witness, you have been saying you forgot[.] [Y]ou forgot [that if] the offense charged against you i[s] proven you can be killed[]?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
I have forgotten that already, Your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
You have forgotten the penalty of death?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
 
I [have] forgotten already.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
What have you forgotten already?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
That.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
You are referring to the paper?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
Yes, Your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
How about that incident where allegedly you raped your daughter, what can you say about that?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
âYa na da adtoâ meaning, âThat is no more already.â
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
What do you mean no more already?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
That is a past thing already.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
Of course it was past happened in the past? [sic]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
I cannot say anything further about that, Your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
So even if you are killed you cannot say anything about that? They might kill you there in the Muntinlupa?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
 
I really donât have anything more, Your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
The Court is telling you that a poisonous substance will be injected to you until you die if you are found guilty. This is simple rape punishable of a reclusion perpetua not death. There is no allegation as to the age of Adela here.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PROS. BENEDICTO:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
33.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Even [so] whatever her age there is no basis here. There is only [an] allegation here [of] relationship with the accused and the alleged victim daughter but there is another one needed. You Mr. Avelino Relox, may not be sentenced to death; it may be [sic] the sentence to you if you are found guilty [is] reclusion perpetua [which] grossly translated [i]s life imprisonment, what can you say about that[?] [I]t may be not death but life imprisonment, what can you say about that?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
Nothing, Your Honor.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
You might die there in Muntinlupa and be buried with nobody [to] see[] you there [or] any of your relatives.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
 
I donât have any[thing more] to comment about that.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COURT:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q
 
-
 
But this is your chance. This is practically your last chance.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A
 
-
 
I really donât have anything more to say, Your Honor.
 
 
Appellant appears to be a broken man resigned to his fate. In situations like these, the Court must even be more vigilant in protecting the rights of the accused. For while the accused may give up all hope in his trial, the Court, as the last bastion where justice is expected to be dispensed, must remain steadfast in seeing that all men, even those who refuse to help themselves, are given a fair and just judgment.
WHEREFORE,
 the assailed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Romblon, in Criminal Case No. 2243 is hereby 
REVERSED
 
and SET ASIDE.
 Appellant, Avelino Relox, is 
ACQUITTED
 and ordered RELEASED from custody unless he is being lawfully held for another lawful cause.  The director of the Bureau of Corrections is ordered to report to this Court the action taken hereon within five days from receipt hereof.  Costs
