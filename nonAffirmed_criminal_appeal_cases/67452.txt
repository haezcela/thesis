SECOND DIVISION


[ G.R. No. 249459, June 14, 2021 ]


PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. NOEL SABATER Y ULAN, RESPONDENT.
D E C I S I O N




LAZARO-JAVIER, J.:


The Case



Petitioner People of the Philippines, through the Office of the 
Solicitor General (OSG), seeks to reverse and set aside the following 
dispositions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 158342:


Resolution
[1]
 dated January 28, 2019 dismissing the petition for late filing; and




Resolution
[2]
 dated September 17, 2019 denying reconsideration.



Antecedents



Under Information
[3]
 dated December 19, 2016, the Naga City Prosecutor's Office charged respondent Noel Sabater 
y
 Ulan with violation of Section 5, Republic Act No. (RA) 9165, thus:


That on November 4, 2016, in the City of Naga, Philippines, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, without authority of law, did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and criminally sell, dispense and deliver to poseur-buyer PO1
 Reimon Joy N. PaaÃ±o one (1) pc. small heat-sealed transparent sachet 
with markings RJNPÂ­AN 11/04/16, weighing 0.049 gram, containing white 
crystalline substance which when tested, was found positive for the 
presence of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride popularly known as "shabu", a 
dangerous drug, in violation of the above-cited law.




ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.



The case was raffled to the Regional Trial Court-Br. 24, Naga City as 
Criminal Case No. 2016-0935. On arraignment, respondent pleaded not 
guilty. Thereafter, trial ensued.
[4]



Approximately five (5) months after the prosecution had formally offered
 its evidence, respondent, on June 28, 2018 filed a motion for plea 
bargaining, proposing to plead 
guilty
 to a lesser offense, 
i.e.
 violation of Section 12, RA 9165 for 
possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus and other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs
, citing AM. No. 18-03-16-SC entitled 
Adoption of the Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases
.
[5]



The prosecution opposed, citing DOJ Circular No. 027 dated June 26, 
2018. It provides that when an accused is charged with selling less than
 five (5) grams of shabu in violation of Section 5, RA 9165, as here, he
 or she may plead guilty to the lesser offense of illegal possession of 
dangerous drugs under Section 11(3) of RA 9165, but not under Section 12
 of the same law.
[6]




The Ruling of the Trial Court



By Order
[7]
 dated August 2, 2018, the trial court granted respondent's motion, nullifying DOJ Circular No. 027 in the process, thus:


WHEREFORE, the Motion is GRANTED. This Court declares that 
DOJ Circular 27 is contrary to the Rules of Court, and encroachment on 
the Rule-Making Power of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. The 
Opposition has no valid factual and legal basis. Plea bargaining is 
allowed in these cases.


SO ORDERED.
[8]



Hence, respondent's not guilty plea was vacated and he was reÂ­arraigned. This time, respondent pleaded 
guilty
 to violation of Section 12, RA 9165.
[9]



As borne in its Judgment
[10]
 
dated September 12, 2018, the trial court rendered a verdict of 
conviction against respondent for violation of Section 12, RA 9165, 
viz
.:


WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused 
NOEL SABATER y ULAN, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offense under
 Section 12, Article II of R.A. 9165.


Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the accused is hereby sentenced
 to suffer imprisonment of six months and one day as minimum to four (4)
 years as maximum. He is further ordered to pay a fine of Fifty Thousand
 Pesos (Php50,000.00). He is further directed to submit himself to a 
drug dependency test. If he admits drug use, or deny it but is found 
positive after the drug dependency test, he shall undergo treatment and 
rehabilitation for a period of not less than 6 months.


In the service of his sentence, the accused shall be credited with the 
period of his preventive detention pursuant to Article 29 of the Revised
 Penal Code, as amended.


SO ORDERED.
[11]


The Ruling of the Court of Appeals



Aggrieved, the People elevated the case to the Court of Appeals via 
certiorari
, docketed as CA-G.R. SP. No. 158342. But by Resolution
[12]

 dated January 28, 2019, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for
 late filing. It found that prosecution received the trial court's Order
 dated August 2, 2018 six (6) days later on August 8, 2018. Thus, it had
 sixty (60) days therefrom or until October 9, 2018 to file a petition 
for 
certiorari
. As it was, the OSG filed its recourse on November 13, 2018 only or thirty five (35) days late.
[13]





The Court of Appeals denied reconsideration on September 17, 2019.
[14]


The Present Petition



The People now prays anew that respondent's plea to a lesser offense of 
violation of Section 12, RA 9165 be set aside, and the case, remanded to
 the trial court for further proceedings.
[15]
 It faults the Court of Appeals for ruling that its petition for 
certiorari

 was filed out of time. It brings to fore the fact that government 
functions in a bureaucracy and certain procedures had to be observed 
before they may elevate a case to a higher court.
[16]

 It is because they followed procedure that the OSG only received copy 
of the trial court's Order dated August 2, 2018 on November 8, 2018, 
after the lapse of the sixty day period for filing a petition for 
certiorari
.
[17]
 The People, thus, prays that it be accorded leniency as regards the period for filing its recourse before the Court of Appeals.





The People likewise argues that the Court of Appeals should have 
resolved the case on the merits, rather than focusing on mere 
technicalities.
[18]
 On the 
merits, the People faults the Court of Appeals for effectively 
sustaining respondent's plea bargaining proposal despite the apparent 
lack of consent and over the vigorous opposition of the prosecutor. It 
asserts that while the landmark case of 
Estipona v. Hon. Lobrigo
[19]
 allowed plea bargaining in drug cases, it did not deviate from the consensual nature and essence of plea bargaining.
[20]

 Thus, when the trial court granted respondent's motion for plea 
bargaining despite the prosecution's objection, the trial court 
effectively encroached upon the government's prerogative to prosecute 
crimes.
[21]





At any rate, the trial court gravely abused its discretion when it 
allowed respondent to plead to a lesser offense which is not necessarily
 included in the offense originally charged.
[22]



Too, the trial court gravely abused its discretion when it declared DOJ 
Circular No. 027 contrary to the Rules of Court and an encroachment into
 the rule-making power of the Court. Instead of choosing between DOJ 
Circular No. 27 and A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC, the trial court should have 
harmonized these issuances.
[23]



In his comment,
[24]
 respondent notes that the People has repeatedly acknowledged its belated filing of its petition for 
certiorari

 before the Court of Appeals without offering cogent justification for 
the lapse. He also notes that the People did not move for 
reconsideration of the trial court's Order dated August 2, 2018, a 
condition 
sine qua non
 for filing a petition for 
certiorari
.



 




In any event, courts have authority to overrule the prosecution's 
objections in plea bargaining, especially so when strict adherence to 
DOJ Circular No. 027 would defeat the principle behind the Court's 
ruling in 
Estipona
 which nullified the "no-plea 
bargaining" provision of RA 9165. A contrary view is tantamount to a 
surrender of the court's sole and supreme authority to command the 
course of the case.





Besides, there is wisdom in allowing the accused in drugs cases to plea 
bargain to the lesser offense of violation of Section 12, RA 9165 from 
Section 5 of the same law where the quantity of drugs involved is 
miniscule: 1) to provide a platform for rehabilitation of small-time 
drug offenders; 2) to curb police operatives' nefarious practice of 
utilizing buy-bust as a tool for abuse; and 3) to unclog our courts and 
focus the government's resources to the real bane of society.



Finally, 
Pascua v. People
[25]

 already resolved whether an accused charged with violation of Section 
5, RA 9165 may plea bargain to the lesser offense of violation of 
Section 12 of the same law.


Threshold Issues


I



Did the Court of Appeals commit reversible error when it dismissed the People's petition for 
certiorari
 for belated filing?


II



Did the trial court commit grave abuse of discretion when it granted 
respondent's proposal to plead guilty to the lesser offense of violation
 of Section 12, RA 9165 without the consent and over the objection of 
the prosecutor?


III



Did the trial court commit grave abuse of discretion when it declared 
DOJ Circular No. 027 an encroachment of the Court's rule-making power?


Ruling



We grant the petition.






The Court of Appeals committed reversible error when it declared that the petition for 
certiorari
 was filed out of time


 







Section 4, Ru1e 65 of the Rules of Court decrees:


Section 4.
 
When and where petition filed
. - 
The petition shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice 
of the judgment, order or resolution. In case a motion for 
reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is 
required or not, the sixty (60) day period shall be counted from notice 
of the denial of said motion.




x x x x


No extension of time to file the petition shall be granted except for 
compelling reason and in no case exceeding fifteen (15) days.



To recall, the sole reason for the dismissal of CA-G.R. SP. No. 158342 
was its supposed belated filing. According to the Court of Appeals, the 
60- day period under Section 4, Rule 65 is reckoned from the 
prosecution's receipt of the trial court's Order dated August 2, 2018 
granting respondent's motion for plea bargaining. Thus, the petition was
 filed thirty five (35) days late on November 13, 2018.



But contrary to the Court of Appeals' ruling as well as the allegations 
of respondent and even the OSG, the 60-day reglementary period should 
have been counted from the prosecution's receipt of the trial court's 
Judgment dated September 12, 2018, rather than the Order dated August 2,
 2018. 
People v. Majingcar
[26]
 elucidates:


Under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, a petition for 
certiorari must be filed within sixty (60) days from notice of the 
judgment, order, or resolution sought to be assailed. Here, the People 
claims that it reckoned the sixty (60) day period from September 18, 
2018 when the prosecutor received a copy of the trial court's judgment 
of conviction that was rendered on the same day. Remarkably, neither 
respondents nor the Court of Appeals disagrees that indeed, on September
 18, 2018, the trial rendered the assailed judgment and it was on the 
same day, too, when the prosecutor had notice thereof. It follows, 
therefore, that starting from September 18, 2018, the sixty day period 
expired on November 17, 2018. So when the People filed its petition for 
certiorari on November 16, 2018, it did so well within the reglementary 
period.





At any rate, the Court of Appeals clearly had its way of counting the 
sixty days. Although it did not mention from what date it started 
counting, logic dictates that it started counting on September 5, 2018, 
when respondents were re-arraigned and allowed to plead "guilty" to the 
lesser offense of violation of Section 12, Article II of RA 9165 in 
Criminal Case Nos. 2016-0774 and 2016-0775. We arrive at this conclusion
 because the Court of Appeals referred to November 4, 2018 as the last 
day for filing the petition for certiorari. Counting backward, the Court
 of Appeals appears to have started counting from September 5, 2018, the
 date when respondents got re-arraigned and pleaded guilty to the lesser
 offense of violation of Section 12, Article II of RA 9165 in both Crim.
 Case Nos. 2016-0774 and 2016-0775.




But this counting is erroneous. For it was still much later, on 
September 18, 2018, when the prosecutor actually had notice of the trial
 court's judgment of conviction that was rendered on the same day. 
Hence, the People correctly reckoned the sixty day period from September
 18, 2018 or until November 17, 2018. Therefore, we repeat that when the
 People subsequently filed its petition for certiorari on November 16, 
2018, it was well within the reglementary period.




To clarify, the Plea Bargaining Resolutions dated August 6, 2018 and 
September 1, 2018 are mere interlocutory orders which cannot be the 
subject of a petition for certiorari.
 To allow a challenge thereof 
via Rule 65 will not only breed undue delay in the administration of 
justice but a much frowned upon piecemeal attacks against the court's 
mere interim issuances. Consistent with consideration of expediency, the
 proper remedy is a one time challenge against the court's final 
judgment on the merits. To allow otherwise would result in a never 
ending trial, not to mention the clogging of the dockets of appellate 
court with 
ad infinitum
 petitions of aggrieved parties-litigants against every interlocutory order of the trial court. (emphases added)




Unfortunately, the OSG never alleged when the People received notice of 
the Judgment dated September 12, 2018. Assuming that the People received
 notice on the same day judgment was promulgated, the OSG had until 
November 11, 2018 to file a petition for 
certiorari
 before the 
Court of Appeals. But since the deadline fell on a Sunday, the petition 
became due on November 12, 2018. As it was, CA-G.R. SP. No. 158342 was 
filed on November 13, 2018 or one (1) day late.





Indeed, the OSG admitted that CA-G.R. SP. No. 158342 was belatedly 
filed. Generally, failure to avail of any remedy against an adverse 
ruling within the reglementary period would allow it to lapse into 
finality. Once final, it becomes immutable and unalterable. It may no 
longer be modified or amended by any court in any manner even if the 
purpose of the modification or amendment is to correct perceived errors 
of law or fact. This is the doctrine of immutability of judgment.
[27]





But the principle of immutability of judgment is not absolute and admits of four (4) exceptions, 
viz
.:
[28]


(1) Correction of clerical errors;


(2) So-called 
nunc pro tunc
 entries which cause no prejudice to any party;




(3) 
Void judgments
; and


(4) Whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision 
rendering its execution unjust and inequitable. (emphasis added)



As will be discussed below, the third exception is applicable here.






The trial court's judgment was void as it granted respondent's plea-bargaining proposal, 
sans
 the consent and over the opposition of the prosecution


 







Section 2, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court embodies the rule on pleaÂ­bargaining, thus:


Sec. 2. Plea of guilty to a lesser offense. - At arraignment, the accused, 
with the consent of the offended party and the prosecutor
,
 may be allowed by the trial court to plead guilty to a lesser offense 
which is necessarily included in the offense charged. After arraignment 
but before trial, the accused may still be allowed to plead guilty to 
said lesser offense after withdrawing his plea of not guilty. No 
amendment of the complaint or information is necessary. (emphasis added)



Verily, the consent of the prosecutor is a condition precedent before an accused may validly plead guilty to a lesser offense.
[29]
 As Associate Justice Rodil V. Zalameda explained in his Separate Concurring Opinion in 
Sayre v. Xenos
:
[30]
 
The reason for this is obvious.
 
The prosecutor has full control of the prosecution of criminal actions.
 
Consequently,
 it is his duty to always prosecute the proper offense, not any lesser 
or graver one, when the evidence in his hands can only sustain the 
former.



Where the prosecution withholds its consent, the trial court cannot 
proceed to approve a plea bargain. There is no meeting of the minds, 
hence, there can be no plea bargaining "agreement" to speak of. Should 
the trial court nevertheless approve the plea bargain over the 
prosecution's objection, it would be doing so in grave abuse of 
discretion. Justice Zalameda further explained:


In choosing to respect the prosecution's discretion to give 
or withhold consent, the Court is not surrendering any of its powers. 
Instead, it is an exercise of sound judicial restraint. Courts cannot 
forcefully insist upon any of the parties to plead in accordance with 
the 
Plea Bargaining Framework
. To emphasize, 
when there is no unanimity between the prosecution and the defense, there is also no plea bargaining agreement to speak of
. If a party refuses to enter a plea in conformity with the 
Plea Bargaining Framework
, 
a court commits grave abuse of discretion should it unduly impose its will on the parties
 by approving a plea bargain and issuing a conviction based on the 
framework
.



Grave abuse of discretion is such capricious and whimsical exercise of 
judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse must be 
grave as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner
 by reason of passion or personal hostility. It must also be so patent 
and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual 
refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in 
contemplation of law.
[31]





Here, the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion or without 
jurisdiction when despite the vehement objection of the prosecution, it 
peremptorily, in clear violation of Section 2, Rule 116 of the Rules of 
Court, approved respondent's proposal to plead guilty to the lesser 
offense of violation of Section 12, RA 9165, in lieu of the original 
charge of violation of Section 5 of the same law.



Otherwise stated, the trial court acted without or beyond its 
jurisdiction when it rendered the assailed Judgment dated September 12, 
2018. 
Mercury Drug Corporation v. Sps. Huang
 teaches that such judgment is actually void, hence, has no legal or binding effect, thus:
[32]


Void judgments produce "no legal [or] binding effect." Hence, they are deemed non-existent.

 They may result from the "lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter"
 or a lack of jurisdiction over the person of either of the parties. 
They may also arise if they were rendered with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.
 (emphases added)



Consequently, the Judgment dated September 12, 2018 is void, ineffectual, and could never lapse into finality.






DOJ Circular No. 27 does not encroach upon the rule making power of the Court


 







Another. DOJ Circular No. 027 does not infringe upon the Court's rule 
making power under the Constitution. This matter has been categorically 
resolved in the landmark ruling of 
Sayre
,
[33]
 thus:



In this petition, A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC is a rule of procedure 
established pursuant to the rule-making power of the Supreme Court that 
serves as a framework and guide to the trial courts in plea bargaining 
violations of R.A. 9165.




Nonetheless, a plea bargain still requires mutual agreement of the 
parties and remains subject to the approval of the court. The acceptance
 of an offer to plead guilty to a lesser offense is not demandable by 
the accused as a matter of right but is a matter addressed entirely to 
the sound discretion of the trial court.


Section 2, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court expressly states:


Sec. 2. Plea of guilty to a lesser offense. - At arraignment, 
the accused, with the consent of the offended party and the prosecutor, may

 be allowed by the trial court to plead guilty to a lesser offense which
 is necessarily included in the effense charged. After arraignment but 
before trial, the accused 
may
 still be allowed to plead guilty to
 said lesser offense after withdrawing his plea of not guilty. No 
amendment of the complaint or information is necessary.


The use of the word "may" signifies that the trial court has discretion 
whether to allow the accused to make a plea of guilty to a lesser 
offense. Moreover, plea bargaining requires the consent of the accused, 
offended party, and the prosecutor. It is also essential that the lesser
 offense is necessarily included in the offense charged.


Taking into consideration the requirements in pleading guilty to a lesser offense, 
We
 find it proper to treat the refusal of the prosecution to adopt the 
acceptable plea bargain for the charge of Illegal Sale of Dangerous 
Drugs provided in A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC as a continuing objection that 
should be resolved by the RTC
. This harmonizes the constitutional 
provision on the rule making power of the Court under the Constitution 
and the nature of plea bargaining in Dangerous Drugs cases. 
DOJ Circular No. 27 did not repeal, alter, or modify the Plea Bargaining Framework in A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC.




Therefore, the DOJ Circular No. 27 provision pertaining to acceptable
 plea bargain for Section 5 of R.A. 9165 did not violate the rule-making
 authority of the Court. DOJ Circular No. 27 merely serves as an 
internal guideline for prosecutors to observe before they may give their
 consent to proposed plea bargains.
 (Emphases added)



This ruling by the Court 
En Banc
 further compels the invalidation of the assailed trial court judgment and its concomitant orders.


ACCORDINGLY
, the petition is 
GRANTED
. The Resolutions dated January 28, 2019 and September 17, 2019 in CA-G.R. SP. No. 158342 are 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
.



The Judgment dated September 12, 2018 and the concomitant orders of the 
Regional Trial Court-Branch 24, Naga City in Criminal Case No. 2016-0935
 are 
VOID
 for having been issued in grave abuse of discretion. The trial court is 
ORDERED
 to proceed with the criminal case against respondent Noel Sabater y Ulan with utmost dispatch.
