"CONTRARY TO LAW."
[12]
On November 8, 1993, the trial court arraigned the accused. She pleaded not guilty to each case.
[13]
 Trial ensued. The cases were consolidated and tried jointly.
The facts are as follows:
In September 1992, accused Chua received a facsimile message from Harmony Electronics Company in Taiwan.
[14]
 The message was written in Chinese characters except for the names of To-ong Zenon Tumenlaco and Tercenio Domingo Fornaliza. Harmony asked her to call up To-ong and Tercenio and tell them that they were needed in Taiwan. Accused Chua contacted To-ong and told him the message.
[15]
In October 1992, To-ong and Tercenio went to the office of accused Chua, and the latter told them that she could send them to Taiwan upon payment of a placement fee of P15,000.00 each. She also asked them to secure NBI clearances and medical certificates.
[16]
 On October 29, 1992, Tercenio, together with private complainant Lonito Baluis, went back to the office of accused Chua and submitted the requirements. Tercenio and Lonito Baluis paid P15,000.00 each for which they were issued a receipt bearing the name Man Tai Trading and General Services with accused Chua's signature.
[17]
Accused Chua assured Tercenio and Lonito Baluis that they would be able to leave for Taiwan soon. Three months passed, but they were not deployed. Tercenio became apprehensive and told accused Chua that he would withdraw his application and ask for refund of the placement fee. Accused Chua repeatedly promised that she would give back the money to him, but she never did. After a few more months, Tercenio could not anymore locate accused Chua.
[18]
Accused Chua used the same 
modus operandi
 on the other private complainants. After requiring each complainant to pay a placement fee of P15,000.00 each, to secure NBI clearances and to undergo medical examinations, she would go in hiding.
In time, complainants inquired from the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA) about accused Chua's activities. The POEA issued a certification that accused Chua was not licensed to recruit persons/workers for overseas employment.
[19]
On October 3, 1995, the trial court promulgated a decision, the dispositive portion
[20]
 of which reads:
"WHEREFORE, premises considered, Alicia A. Chua is hereby found:
"1) Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Recruitment committed in large scale in Criminal Case No. 93-127418 and is therefore sentenced to serve a penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.00;

"9) Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa in Criminal Case No. 93-127427 and is sentenced to serve indeterminate sentence of four (4) years of

"As earlier stated, Criminal Case No. 93-127424 is dismissed for failure of the prosecution to adduce evidence.
"SO ORDERED.
"Manila, September 20, 1995.
"(Sgd.) ZEUS C. ABROGAR
"Judge."
Hence, this appeal.
[21]
In her brief, accused-appellant anchors her defense on the approval of her application for a license to recruit on April 13, 1993, which, according to her, rendered her a genuine holder of authority. She also claimed that she was denied her constitutional right to compulsory process.
[22]
On the other hand, the Solicitor General contends that appellant was a non-licensee and had no authority to recruit anyone for overseas employment, and that she failed to proffer any compelling reason to justify her request for the production of POEA records.
[23]
We find the appeal devoid of merit.
Appellant interposes the defense that the approval of her application for a service contractor's authority on April 13, 1993 should be given a retroactive effect as to make all her previous recruitment activities valid. However, this issue was not raised in the trial court. She cannot now be allowed to raise it for the first time on appeal without offending basic rules of fair play, justice and due process.
[24]
The records show that the license was not issued due to her failure to comply with post-licensing requirements.
[25]
 It is the issuance of the license which makes the holder thereof authorized to perform recruitment activities. The law specifically provides that "every license shall be 
valid
 for at least two (2) years 
from the date of issuance
 unless sooner cancelled or revoked by the Secretary.
[26]
Appellant herself admitted that she had no authority to recruit private complainants, thus:
ATTY. MONTERO (to witness):
 
 
Q:
Now what was the reply of Harmony Electronics Company when you questioned them about the use of your company?
A:
They wrote back to me and they told me that "never mind, we only need Cenon To-ong and Domingo Tersenio." 
But I told them that I am not in the position to employ these people because I am not a licensed agency for that matter
 and they said that "I would just send you an authority and show this to the pertaining government agency who could at least send these two people."
 
 
Q:
So what did you do after that?
A:
I told them to send me something if I can do the way out of it, I will ask anybody from my colleagues to do the hiring of these people.
 
 
Q:
Did you ask anybody from your colleagues to do the hiring of these two?
A:
I did but Alcamojar was not also licensed.
 
 
Q:
So what happened after that?
A:
I told Cenon because Cenon is much better to understand that, he looked for one company who could just or whom I can transfer the authority that the Harmony Electronics would be sending me, so I will just transfer the authority to any agency who could send them back to Taiwan.
[27]
Appellant cannot now claim that she was a genuine holder of authority from the Secretary of Labor and Employment to recruit factory workers for Harmony Electronics Company based in Taiwan.
As to her claim of denial of the constitutional right to compulsory process, we find the same to be without merit.
The 1973 and 1987 Constitutions expanded the right to compulsory process which now includes the right to secure the production of evidence in one's behalf.
[28]
 By analogy, U.S. vs. Ramirez
[29]
 which laid down the requisites for compelling the attendance of witnesses, may be applied to this expanded concept. Thus, the movant must show: (a) that the evidence is really material; (b) that he is not guilty of neglect in previously obtaining the production of such evidence; (c) that the evidence will be available at the time desired; and (d) that no similar evidence could be obtained.
In the case at bar, the trial court correctly denied appellant's motion for the production of the records which were the basis in issuing the POEA Certification dated February 3, 1994,
[30]
 as the same would not in any way alter the undisputed fact that appellant was not issued a license until then.
[31]
WHEREFORE
, the Court 
AFFIRMS
 the appealed decision 
in toto,
 with costs against appellant.
SO ORDERED.
