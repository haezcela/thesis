MENDOZA, J.:




This case is here on automatic appeal from the 
decision,
[1]

  dated October 18, 2000, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 8, City of
 Malaybalay, finding accused-appellant Ramil Sajolga guilty of rape and 
sentencing him to death and to pay the victim Genlei Abejaron
[2]
 in the sum of 
P75,000.00 as indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.
  


 The information, filed by the Assistant Provincial 
Prosecutor of Bukidnon, alleged Â¾    




That on or about the 17th day of October, 1998, in the 
afternoon,
 at Sitio San Ramon, Cojuangco, Kalagutay, Base Camp, Municipality of 
Maramag, Province of Bukidnon, Philippines and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, prompted by lewd 
designs, with the use of force and intimidation on the person of GENLEI 
ABEJARON, a fifteen (15) year-old minor and accusedâs half-sister, did 
then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and criminally box the latter which
 caused her [to become] unconscious and while at that state, undress 
GENLEI ABEJARON, remove her panties, insert his penis into the vagina of
 GENLEI ABEJARON, and have sexual intercourse with GENLEI ABEJARON, 
against her will, to the damage and prejudice of GENLEI ABEJARON in such
 amount as may be allowed by law.
[3]
 




Upon being arraigned, accused-appellant pleaded not 
guilty,
[4]
 
whereupon trial ensued. 


At the pre-trial conference, the parties stipulated as 
follows: 


That private complainant Genlei Abejaron was born 
on February 15, 1983. 
    
  
That accused and private complainant are 
siblings, being children of Segundina Sajolga.
[5]


That before and up to October 17, 1998, private 
complainant was living with her mother in Agrosite, Poblacion, Maramag, 
Bukidnon.
[6]
    
  
  The prosecution presented two witnesses: complainant Genlei Abejaron 
and her teacher Mrs. Erlinda Alceso.
[7]
 Their testimonies are to the following effect: 

From 1997 up to 1998, Genlei Abejaron stayed in the house of 
her 
teacher, Mrs. Erlinda Alceso, during weekdays as a working student 
because the Maramag Elementary School, where she was studying, was some 
three kilometers away from her motherâs house in Sitio San Ramon, 
Cojuangco, Kalagutay, Base Camp, Maramag, Bukidnon. She went home to her
 motherâs house only on weekends.
[8]
 


Genlei testified that at about 5 oâclock in the afternoon of 
October 17, 1998, while she was alone in her motherâs house playing 
cards, someone knocked on the door, and, when she opened it, she saw her
 half-brother, accused-appellant Ramil Sajolga, who was drunk. Without 
warning, accused-appellant boxed her in the abdomen, causing her to fall
 on the floor on her buttocks. Genlei said that she gasped for breath as
 she suffered excruciating pain. She tried to give accused-appellant 
some blows but accused-appellant proved to be stronger. Genlei said 
accused-appellant dragged her to the bedroom, made her lie on the bed, 
and took off her shorts and panties. Before she became unconscious, 
Genlei remembered that accused-appellant kissed her lips and 
neck.
[9]




When Genlei recovered, she found herself naked and lying on 
the 
bed. Her body was aching and her vagina was sore, with a sticky 
substance, presumably semen, in her private part. Accused-appellant was 
lying beside her, asleep, with his naked body covered by a blanket. When
 she realized that she had been violated by accused-appellant, Genlei 
took hold of a pillow, the nearest weapon available, and pummeled the 
latter, all the while crying and cursing him. Accused-appellant calmly 
told her that there was nothing she could do and pointed out to her that
 she would not win any case against him as he had not been sued or 
jailed despite molesting her twice when she was eight years old.
[10]
 


When her mother arrived, Genlei tried to tell her what had 
happened
 but, as she had expected, her mother only shouted at her. Genlei left 
for Mrs. Alcesoâs house the next day, without being able to tell her 
mother what had happened. Genlei tried to tell her mother again about 
her misfortune when the latter visited her in the boarding house, but 
once more she failed.
[11]
 


Genlei kept her torment a secret until sometime in January 
1999, 
when she told her teacher Maxima Cabang that she wanted to stop 
schooling. When Mrs. Cabang asked for her reason, Genlei told her that 
her half-brother had raped her. Mrs. Cabang then asked Genlei if she 
wanted to file a case, to which she replied that she would think it over
 because it would not be easy to file a case.
[12]
 


Mrs. Alceso noticed that something was bothering Genlei. She 
once 
saw Genlei crying while watching a rape scene on television. Genlei had 
asked her as to what could possibly happen if her mother learned that 
she had been raped. Later, on the assurance that her teachers would help
 her, Genlei told Mrs. Alceso that her half-brother raped her but she 
was afraid her mother would not believe her.
[13]
 


In January 1999, one of Mrs. Alcesoâs co-teachers informed 
her that
 Genlei could be pregnant, as she was seen vomiting. Mrs. Alceso 
confronted Genlei and told her that she might be carrying a baby. Genlei
 was made to hide in another teacherâs (Mrs. Divina Flores) house, 
because she was afraid that her mother might learn about her pregnancy. 
In February 1999, Genleiâs teachers, Mrs. Alceso, Mrs. Flores, and a 
Mrs. Bertrudes, took her to the Department of Social Welfare and 
Development (DSWD) in Maramag, Bukidnon. A DSWD officer assisted in 
filing a case against her half-brother.
[14]
 


The results of the medical examination (Exh. A) conducted on 
Genlei
 by Dr. Evangeline C. Revilla of the Bukidnon Provincial Hospital of 
Maramag on February 10, 1999 showed the following: 




- has minimal pubic hair at the mons pubis 


- cervix has old healed lacerated wound at the 1:00 
oâclock, 2:00 oâclock, 5 oâclock and the 11:00 oâclock position 



- admits 1 finger very easily 


NOTE: has minimal blood at examining finger because sheâs 
on her first day of menstruation.
[15]
 




The defense offered no objection to the admission of the 
Medical 
Certificate, including the findings therein. For this reason, the 
testimony of the doctor was dispensed with.
[16]
 The prosecution thereafter rested 
its case. 


The defense thereafter presented three witnesses: 
accused-appellant
 Ramil Sajolga, his friend and neighbor Aurelio Manuel, and his mother 
Segundina Recaros. Accused-appellant Ramil Sajolga interposed the 
defense of denial and alibi. He claimed that in the morning of October 
17, 1999, he and his neighbor, Aurelio Manuel, went to Purok 8, about 
ten kilometers from Sitio San Ramon, Cojuangco. Riding on a cart pulled 
by a carabao, they arrived in Purok 8 at about 3 oâclock in the 
afternoon. They cut bamboo poles for their houses. As they were unable 
to finish, they stayed at Abundio Carbonaâs (the uncle of Aurelio 
Manuelâs wife) house until lunch time the following day. They arrived 
home at about 3 oâclock in the afternoon. Accused-appellant requested 
his mother for hot water for coffee when he arrived. He said he did not 
see Genlei as she did not come home in October 1998. Accused-appellant 
said that Genlei had been staying with her teacher, Mrs. Erlinda Alceso.
 He admits, however, that the house where he and his live-in partner and
 their child lived was a mere five armâs length away from his motherâs 
house. His alibi was corroborated by Aurelio Manuel. 
[17]
 


Segundina Recaros explained that Genlei seldom went home 
because of
 the danger posed by two warring groups of land claimants in the area. 
Both accused-appellant and Segundina stated that Genlei allegedly came 
home only on September 16, 1999 but went back to Maramag on the same 
day. According to them, Genlei was also home on December 28, 1999 for 
accused-appellantâs birthday.
[18]
 


On October 18, 2000, judgment was rendered by the trial court
 
finding accused-appellant guilty of qualified rape. The dispositive 
portion of the decision read: 




WHEREFORE, judgment is entered finding accused RAMIL 
SAJOLGA 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of rape and penalized 
under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 8353 
and he is therefore sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty of DEATH. He
 is further ordered to indemnify his victim Genlei Abejaron the sum of 
P75,000.00 and moral damages of P50,000.00. 


SO ORDERED.
[19]
 


Hence, this appeal. Accused-appellant alleges thatâ    





THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF 
THE 
CRIME OF RAPE DESPITE THE WEAKNESS OF THE PROSECUTION EVIDENCE AND 
REASONABLE DOUBT OF ITS COMMISSION.
[20]
 


In his reply brief dated August 1, 2002, he contends: 



ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY, HE IS ONLY 
GUILTY OF 
THE CRIME OF SIMPLE RAPE BECAUSE THE ACCUSED IS NOT THE FULL-BLOODED 
BROTHER OF THE VICTIM AND NEITHER WAS THE CORRECT RELATIONSHIP STATED IN
 THE INFORMATION. 


When an alleged victim of rape says that she was violated, 
she says
 in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on
 her and, so long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the 
accused may be convicted on the basis thereof. We find complainantâs 
testimony to be straightforward, candid, and credible. 


First.
 Accused-appellant contends that 
complainant failed 
to present credible and substantial evidence that he sexually abused 
her. He said that âthe complaint of pain and sticky fluid in the vagina 
can also be felt or experienced by a woman even though there is no 
sexual abuse. . . . Thus, despite her testimony that accused kissed her 
and she saw him naked, it is dubious that she truly lost her 
consciousness and accused sexually abused her.â
[21]
 


The contention is without merit. Rule 133, Â§4 of the Revised 
Rules on Evidence provides: 




Circumstantial evidence, when sufficient. 
Â¾
 Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if: 



(a)      There is more than one circumstance; 


(b)      The facts from which the inferences are derived 
are proven; and 


(c)      The combination of all the circumstances is such 
as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. 




In several cases,
[22]
 we 
have sustained convictions based on circumstantial evidence. Indeed, a 
conviction based on circumstantial evidence is proper if the 
circumstances proven constitute an unbroken chain which lead to a fair 
and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of 
all others, as the guilty person.
[23]

 In this case, the totality of circumstances warrants a finding that 
private complainant was raped by accused-appellant while the former was 
unconscious. The prosecution presented credible and substantial evidence
 showing interlocking circumstances that accused-appellant sexually 
abused complainant. As pointed out by the Solicitor-General, these 
circumstances are: 


(a) When Genlei opened the door after hearing some knocks, 
appellant immediately entered and boxed her on the abdomen even without 
any provocation on the part of Genlei (TSN, December 2, 1999, pp. 2-17, 
18); 


(b) When Genlei fell but still conscious, appellant dragged 
her and
 made her lie on the bed, removed her shorts and panties, after which 
appellant kissed her neck and lips. Then Genlei lost consciousness. 
There was no other man inside the house (Ibid.); 


(c)              When Genlei recovered, she was naked, her 
body was
 aching, her vagina was painful and she felt that there was a sticky 
substance on her vagina. Appellant was lying beside her and he was naked
 too (Ibid.); 


(d) When Genlei struck appellant with a pillow and cursed 
him, 
appellant told her that there is nothing that she could do. Appellant 
had the guts to say this because he raped Genlei twice when she was 
still eight (8) years old and he is still free (Ibid., pp. 8-10, 14); 
and 


(e) The present offense against Genlei was perpetrated on 
October 
17, 1998 and later on Genlei became pregnant but her pregnancy was 
aborted (TSN, December 2, 1999, pp. 3-7; TSN, January 25, 2000, pp. 1-6;
 TSN, April 28, 2000, pp. 1-17).
[24]
 


Second.
 Accused-appellant claims that 
complainantâs 
behavior after the alleged ârapeâ negates its occurrence. She was, 
according to him, âamazingly containedâ when their mother arrived home. 
He capitalizes on the failure of complainant to report the alleged rape 
until after four (4) months from its occurence. 

  Complainantâs silence upon her motherâs arrival was sufficiently 
explained. She knew that her mother would just dismiss it if she told 
her that her brother had raped her. As Genlei said: 




[FISCAL TORIBIO, counsel for the prosecution]: 


Q     When you filed this case, Genlei, did you not tell 
your mother? 

      A     No, because she would not listen to me. 


Q     You mean to tell the court that there was an attempt 
to tell your mother but she will not believe you? 

      A     Yes, maâam. 


Q     How did you tell your mother? 

      A     I told her, Ma, would you give in to my request, that do not
 drink now because I have a problem to tell you. 


Q     You requested your mother not to drink, you mean to 
say that your mother is a habitual drinker? 

      A     She is not a habitual drinker but she drinks. 


Q     When you told this to your mother, what was her 
reaction if any? 

      A     She told me just do that after sometime, Day, because I am 
very thirsty I will have to buy Fighter wine. 


Q     After that was there an attempt by you to tell your 
mother? 

      A     Yes, at my boarding house. 


Q     Were you able to tell your mother what your brother 
did to you? 

      A     No, maâam. 


Q     Up to this time, Genlei? 

      A     Yes, maâam.
[25]
 




On the other hand, Segundina claimed that she no longer 
understood 
her daughterâs actions, as it seemed that the latter had lost respect 
for her. Genlei stayed with Mrs. Taning Taganas from December 1998 to 
January 1999. All the while, Genlei had been unable to talk to her 
mother about what happened to her as she was afraid that her mother 
would not believe her. It was only when classes resumed in January 1999 
that Genlei was able to fully narrate her torment. Around that time, 
Genlei found that she was pregnant. On January 23, 1999, Mrs. Taganas 
had to call Segundina because Genlei was sick. Segundina stayed with her
 daughter for three days. But in February, Genlei had to be hidden from 
her mother by her teachers. She stayed at the house of one of her 
teacherâs (Mrs. Divina Flores). By February 8, 1999, Genlei was placed 
in the custody of the DSWD. She suffered an abortion sometime during the
 months of January and February 1999.
[26]
 


Indeed, although complainant was unable to get sympathy from 
her 
mother, she was able to find this from her teachers. This explains her 
silence and the delay of about four (4) months in reporting the crime to
 the authorities. Furthermore, the period of October 1998 to February 
1999 were quite tumultuous for her. She was raped on October 17, 1998. 
On the 22nd of the same month, she had to spend the night at the Kalasag
 Center (Police Detachment) of Maramag because Mrs. Alcesoâs husband 
drove her out of their house as Genleiâs presence was seen by Mr. Alceso
 as an extra expense. When Segundina Recaros learned about this, she 
made Genlei live with her friend, Mrs. Taganas. 


Third
. Alternatively, accused-appellant 
argues that the 
death penalty may not be imposed upon him because, although he and 
complainant were related, the prosecution failed to show that 
complainant was below 18 years of age at the time the rape took place as
 this was merely alleged in the information. 

  Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code provides in pertinent part: 





The death penalty shall be imposed if the crime of rape is 
committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying 
circumstances: 




1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and 
the 
offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by 
consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the 
common-law spouse of the parent of the victim; . . . 


Although no birth certificate or document was presented to 
prove 
that complainant was 15 years old at the time she was raped, the parties
 stipulated that she was born on February 15, 1983. This stipulation is 
contained in a Pre-Trial Order issued by the trial court.
[27]

 A stipulation of facts in criminal cases is now authorized to be made 
by Rule 118, Â§Â§1 and 4 of the Revised Rules of Criminal 
Procedure.
[28]

 Thus, not only was complainantâs age alleged in the information, it was
 proven, having been made the subject of stipulation and admission. 



For the purpose of imposing the death penalty under paragraph
 1 of 
Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, the relationship of the parties
 must also be alleged and proved. It cannot be the subject of 
stipulation of the parties. Even if such is proven, it cannot be 
considered in the imposition of the death penalty if it is not properly 
alleged in the information. The reason for this is that the age (below 
18) and relationship of the offender and the offended party in Art. 
266-B, par. 1 are in the nature of qualifying circumstances requiring 
the imposition of a more severe penalty. Hence, due process requires 
that the accused be informed of them as possibly qualifying the crime 
with which he is charged. 


Accused-appellant is not âa parent, ascendant, step-parent, 
or 
guardian or the common-law spouseâ of the victimâs mother, but a 
relative by consanguinity. Hence, as this Court has held, it must be 
alleged in the information that he is a relative by consanguinity or 
affinity, as the case may be, within the third civil degree.
[29]

 Not only should ârelationship by consanguinity or affinityâ be alleged,
 it is also necessary to specify that such relationship is âwithin the 
third civil degree.â
[30]
 Mere 
allegation and the stipulation that accused-appellant is the brother of 
the victim because they have a common mother are not enough to satisfy 
the special qualifying circumstance of relationship. 


Anent accused-appellantâs contention that âhe is guilty only 
of 
simple rape and not qualified rape because he is not a full-blooded 
brother of the victim sister and there are no half measures in the 
Heinous Crime Law,â suffice it to say the law does not distinguish 
between full blood and half blood relatives. The law does not in fact 
speak of full blood and half blood relatives but âof relatives by 
consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree.â As a recent 
study has found, âaround 92% of the perpetrators in rape cases are known
 to the child and 39% of these cases were committed by legal or common 
law relatives.â
[31]
 


In any event, because of the failure of the prosecution to 
allege 
that accused-appellant is a relative by consanguinity within the third 
civil degree of the offended party, accused-appellant can only be held 
liable for simple rape even if it was proven and stipulated that the 
victim was under eighteen (18) years of age and that he is a 
half-brother of complainant. 


The penalty for simple rape is reclusion perpetua. In view of
 the 
imposition of this reduced penalty on accused-appellant, the amount of 
civil indemnity awarded by the Regional Trial Court to the victim should
 likewise be reduced from P75,000.00 to P50,000.00. The award of 
P50,000.00 as moral damages, however, remains.
[32]

 Because of the aggravating circumstances of relationship and age, 
exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00 should also be awarded 
even if it cannot be appreciated as a qualifying circumstance.
[33]
 


WHEREFORE,
 the decision of the 
Regional Trial 
Court, Branch 8, City of Malaybalay is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION 
that accused-appellant Ramil Sajolga y Omera is found guilty of simple 
rape and is ordered to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to 
pay complainant Genlei Abejaron the amounts of P50,000.00 as indemnity, 
P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.

complainant Genlei Abejaron, explained that her first husband, Olegario 
Sajolga, then already deceased, was accused-appellantâs father. On the 
other hand, Genlei is her daughter by her second husband, Eulalio 
Abejaron, also deceased, although Genlei claims that her father was
