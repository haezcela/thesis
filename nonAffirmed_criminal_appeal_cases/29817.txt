ROMEO M. ACOP AND FRANCISCO G. ZUBIA, JR., PETITIONERS-INTERVENORS.
D E C I S I O N




AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:


The constitutionality of Sections 4 and 7 of Republic Act No. 8249 â an act which further defines the jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
 â is being challenged in this petition for prohibition and mandamus.  Petitioner Panfilo Lacson, joined by petitioners-intervenors Romeo Acop and Francisco Zubia, Jr., also seeks to prevent the 
Sandiganbayan
 from proceeding with the trial of Criminal Cases Nos. 23047-23057 (for multiple murder) against them on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.
The antecedents of this case, as gathered from the partiesâ pleadings and documentary proofs, are as follows:
In the early morning of May 18, 1995, eleven (11) persons believed to be members of the 
Kuratong Baleleng
 gang, reportedly an organized crime syndicate which had been involve in a spate of bank robberies in Metro Manila, were slain  along Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City by elements of the Anti-Bank Robbery and Intelligence Task Group (ABRITG) headed by Chief Superintendent Jewel Canson of the Philippine National Police (PNP).  The ABRITG was composed of police officers from the Traffic Management Command (TMC) led by petitioner-intervenor Senior Superintendent Francisco Zubia, Jr.; Presidential Anti-Crime Commission â Task Force Habagat (PACC-TFH) headed by petitioner Chief Superintendent Panfilo M. Lacson; Central Police District Command (CPDC) led by Chief Superintendent Ricardo de Leon; and the Criminal Investigation Command (CIC) headed by petitioner-intervenor Chief Superintendent Romeo Acop.
Acting on a media expose of SPO2 Eduardo delos Reyes, a member of the CIC, that what actually transpired at dawn of May 18, 1995 was a summary execution (or a rub out) and not a shoot-out between the Kuratong Baleleng gang members and the ABRITG, Ombudsman Aniano Desierto formed a panel of investigators headed by the Deputy Ombudsman for Military Affairs, Bienvenido Blancaflor, to investigate the incident.  This panel later absolve from any criminal liability all the PNP officers and personnel allegedly involved in the May 18, 1995 incident, with a finding that the said incident was a legitimate police operation.
[1]
However, a review board led by Overall Deputy Ombudsman Francisco Villa modified the Blancaflor panelâs finding and recommended the indictment for multiple murder against twenty-six (26) respondents, including herein petitioner and intervenors.  This recommendation was approved by the Ombudsman, except for the withdrawal of the charges against Chief Supt. Ricardo de Leon.
Thus, on November 2, 1995, petitioner Panfilo Lacson was among those charged as principal in eleven (11) informations for murder
[2]
 before the 
Sandiganbayanâs
 Second Division, while intervenors Romeo Acop and Francisco Zubia, Jr. were among those charged in the same informations as accessories after-the-fact.
Upon motion by all the accused in the 11 informations,
[3]
 the Sandiganbayan allowed them to file a motion for reconsideration of the Ombudsmanâs action.
[4]
After conducting a reinvestigation, the Ombudsman filed on March 1, 1996 eleven (11) 
amended
 informations
[5]
 before the 
Sandiganbayan
, wherein petitioner was charged only as an accessory, together with Romeo Acop and Francisco Zubia, Jr. and others.  One of the accused
[6]
 was dropped from the case.
On March 5-6, 1996, all the accused filed separate motions questioning the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, asserting that under the amended informations, the cases fall within the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court pursuant to Section 2 (paragraphs a and c) of Republic Act No. 7975.
[7]
 They contend that the said law limited the jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
 to cases where one or more of the "
principal
 accusedâ are government officials with Salary Grade (SG) 27 or higher, or PNP officials with the rank of Chief Superintendent (Brigadier General) or higher.  The highest ranking 
principal
 accused in the amended informations has the rank of only a Chief Inspector, and none has the equivalent of at least SG 27.
Thereafter, in a Resolution
[8]
 dated May 8, 1996 (promulgated on May 9, 1996), penned by Justice Demetriou, with Justices Lagman and de Leon concurring, and Justices Balajadia and Garchitorena dissenting,
[9]
 the 
Sandiganbayan
 admitted the amended information and ordered the cases transferred to the Quezon City Regional Trial Court which has original and exclusive jurisdiction under R.A. 7975, as none of the principal accused has the rank of Chief Superintendent or higher.
On May 17, 1996, the Office of the Special Prosecutor moved for a reconsideration, insisting that the cases should remain with the 
Sandiganbayan
.  This was opposed by petitioner and some of the accused.
While these motions for reconsideration were pending resolution, and even before the issue of jurisdiction cropped up with the filing of the amended informations on March 1, 1996, House Bill No. 2299
[10]
 and No. 1094
[11]
 (sponsored by Representatives Edcel C. Lagman and Neptali M. Gonzales II, respectively), as well as Senate Bill No. 844
[12]
 (sponsored by Senator Neptali Gonzales), were introduced in Congress, defining/expanding the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.  Specifically, the said bills sought, among others, to amend the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan by deleting the word âprincipalâ from the phrase âprincipal accusedâ in Section 2 (paragraphs a and c) of R.A. No. 7975.
These bills were consolidated and later approved into law as R.A. No. 8249
[13]
.  The law is entitled, âAN ACT FURTHER DEFINING THE JURISDICTION OF THE SANDIGANBAYAN, AMENDING FOR THE PURPOSE PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 1606, AS AMENDED, PROVIDING FUNDS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.â  It took effect on February 25, 1997.13 by the President of the Philippines on February 5, 1997.
Subsequently, on March 5, 1997, the Sandiganbayan promulgated a Resolution
[14]
 denying the motion for reconsideration of the Special Prosecutor, ruling that it âstands pat in its resolution dated May 8, 1996.â
On the same day,
[15]
 the 
Sandiganbayan
 issued an ADDENDUM to its March 5, 1997 Resolution, the pertinent portion of which reads:
â
After
 Justice Lagman wrote the Resolution and Justice Demetriou concurred in it, but 
before
 Justice de Leon, Jr. rendered his concurring and dissenting opinion, the legislature enacted Republic Act 8249 and the President of the Philippines approved it on February 5, 1997.  
Considering the pertinent provisions of the new law, Justices Lagman and Demetriou are now in favor of granting, as they are now granting, the Special Prosecutorâs motion for reconsideration.  Justice de Leon has already done so in his concurring and dissenting opinion.
x x x              x x x              x x x
â
Considering that three of the accused in each of these cases are PNP Chief Superintendents:
  namely, Jewel T. Canson, Romeo M. Acop and Panfilo M. Lacson, 
and that trial has not yet begun in all these cases 
â in fact, no order of arrest has been issued â 
this court has competence to take cognizance of these cases.
âTo recapitulate, the net result of all the foregoing is that by the vote of 3 to 2, 
the court admitted the Amended Informations in these cases and by the unanimous vote of 4 with 1 neither concurring nor dissenting, retained jurisdiction to try and decide the cases.
â
[16]
 [Emphasis supplied]
Petitioner now questions the constitutionality of Section 4 R.A. No. 8249, including Section 7 thereof which provides that the said law âshall apply to all cases pending in any court over which trial has not begun as of the approval hereof.â  Petitioner argues that:
âa)  The questioned provision of the statute were introduced by the authors thereof in bad faith as it was made to precisely suit the situation in which petitionerâs cases were in at the 
Sandiganbayan
 by restoring jurisdiction thereover to it, thereby violating his right to procedural due process and the equal protection clause of the Constitution.  Further, from the way the 
Sandiganbayan
 has foot-dragged for nine (9) months the resolution of a pending incident involving the transfer of the cases to the Regional Trial Court, the passage of the law may have been timed to overtake such resolution to render the issue therein moot, and frustrate the exercise of petitionerâs vested rights under the old 
Sandiganbayan
 law (RA 7975)
âb)  Retroactive application of the law is plain from the fact that it was again made to suit the peculiar circumstances in which petitionerâs cases were under, namely, that trial had not yet commenced, as provided in Section 7, to make certain that those cases will no longer be remanded to the Quezon City Regional Trial Court, as the 
Sandiganbayan
 alone should try them, thus making it an 
ex post facto
 legislation and a denial of the right of petitioner as an accused in Criminal Case Nos. 23047 â 23057 to procedural due process
âc)  The title of the law is misleading in that it contains the aforesaid âinnocuousâ provisions in Sections 4 and 7 which actually expands rather than defines the old 
Sandiganbayan
 law (RA 7975), thereby violating the one-title-one-subject requirement for the passage of statutes under Section 26(1), Article VI of the Constitution.â
[17]
For their part, the intervenors, in their petition-in-intervention, add that âwhile Republic Act No. 8249 innocuously appears to have merely expanded the jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
, the introduction of Sections 4 and 7 in said statute impressed upon it the character of a class legislation and an 
ex-post facto
 statute intended to apply specifically to the accused in the 
Kuratong Baleleng
 case pending before the 
Sandiganbayan
.â
[18]
 They further argued that if their case is tried before the 
Sandiganbayan
 their right to procedural due process would be violated as they could no longer avail of the two-tiered appeal to the 
Sandiganbayan
, which they acquired under R.A. 7975, before recourse to the Supreme Court.
Both the Office of the Ombudsman and the Solicitor General filed separate pleadings in support of the constitutionality of the challenged provisions of the law in question and praying that both the petition and the petition-in-intervention be dismissed.
This Court then issued a Resolution
[19]
 requiring the parties to file simultaneously within a 
nonextendible
 period of ten (10) days from notice thereof additional memoranda on the question of whether the subject amended informations filed in Criminal Cases Nos. 23047-23057 sufficiently alleged the commission by the accused therein of the crime charged within the meaning Section 4 b of Republic Act No. 8249, so as to bring the said cases 
within
 the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.
The parties, except for the Solicitor General who is representing the People of the Philippines, filed the required supplemental memorandum within the nonextendible reglementary period.
The established rule is that every law has in its favor the presumption of constitutionality, and to justify its nullification there must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, not a doubtful and argumentative one.
[20]
 The burden of proving the invalidity of the law lies with those who challenge it.  That burden, we regret to say, was not convincingly discharged in the present case.
The creation of the 
Sandiganbayan
 was mandated in Section 5, Article XIII of the 1973 Constitution, which provides:
â
SEC. 5.
   The Batasang Pambansa shall create a special court, to be known as Sandiganbayan, which shall have jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases involving graft and corrupt practices and such other offenses committed by public officers and employees including those in government-owned or controlled corporations, in relation to their office as may be determined by law."
The said special court is retained in the new (1987) Constitution under the following provision in Article XI, Section 4:
â
Section 4.
   The present anti-graft court known as the Sandiganbayan shall continue to function and exercise its jurisdiction as now or hereafter may be provided by law.â
Pursuant to the constitutional mandate, Presidential Decree No. 1486
[21]
 created the 
Sandiganbayan.
  Thereafter, the following laws on the 
Sandiganbayan
, in chronological order, were enacted:  P.D. No. 1606,
[22]
 Section 20 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129,
[23]
 P.D. No. 1860,
[24]
 P.D. No. 1861,
[25]
 R.A. No. 7975,
[26]
 and R.A. No. 8249.
[27]
 Under the latest amendments introduced by 
Section 4 of R.A. No. 8249
, the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over the following cases:

Section 7 of R.A. No. 7975 reads:
âSEC. 7.  Upon the effectivity of this Act, all criminal cases which trial has not begun in the Sandiganbayan shall be referred to the proper courts.â
Under paragraphs a and c, Section 4 of R.A. 8249, the word â
principal
â before the word âaccusedâ appearing in the above-quoted Section 2 (paragraphs a and c) of R.A. 7975, was 
deleted
.  It is due to this deletion of the word âprincipalâ that the parties herein are at loggerheads over the jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
.  Petitioner and intervenors, relying on R.A. 7975, argue that the Regional Trial Court, not the 
Sandiganbayan
, has jurisdiction over the Subject criminal cases since none of the 
principal
 accused under the 
amended
 information has the rank of Superintendent
[28]
 or higher.  On the other hand, the Office of the Ombudsman, through the Special Prosecutor who is tasked to represent the People before the Supreme Court except in certain cases,
[29]
 contends that the 
Sandiganbayan
 has jurisdiction pursuant to R.A. 8249.
A perusal of the aforequoted Section 4 of R.A. 8249 reveals that to fall under the exclusive original jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
, the following requisites must concur:  
(1)
 the offense committed is a violation of 
(a)
 R.A. 3019, as amended (the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), 
(b)
 R.A. 1379 (the law on ill-gotten wealth), 
(c)
 Chapter II, Section 2, Title VII, Book II of the Revised Penal Code (the law on bribery),
[30]
 
(d)
 Executive Order Nos. 1, 2, 14, and 14-A, issued in 1986 (sequestration cases),
[31]
 or 
(e)
 other offenses or felonies whether simple or complexed with other crimes; 
(2)
 the offender committing the offenses in items 
(a), (b), (c)
 and 
(e)
 is a public official or employee
[32]
 holding any of the positions enumerated in paragraph a of Section 4; and 
(3)
 the offense committed is in relation to the office.
Considering that herein petitioner and intervenors are being charged with murder which is a felony punishable under Title VIII of the Revised Penal Code, the governing provision on the jurisdictional offense is 
not
 paragraph but 
paragraph b
, Section 4 of R.A. 8249.  This paragraph b pertains to â
other offenses
 or 
felonies
 whether simple or complexed with other crimes committed by the public officials and employees mentioned in subsection a of [Section 4, R.A. 8249] in relation to their office.â  The phrase âother offenses or feloniesâ is too broad as to include the crime of murder, provided it was committed in relation to the accusedâs official functions.  Thus, under said paragraph b, what determines the 
Sandiganbayanâs
 jurisdiction is the 
official position
 or 
rank
 of the offender â that is, whether he is one of those public officers or employees enumerated in paragraph a of Section 4.  The offenses mentioned in paragraphs a, b and c of the same Section 4 do 
not
 make any reference to the 
criminal participation
 of the accused public officer as to whether he is charged as a principal, accomplice or accessory.  In enacting R.A. 8249, the Congress simply restored the original provisions of P.D. 1606 which does not mention the criminal participation of the public officer as a requisite to determine the jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
.
Petitioner and intervenorsâ posture that Section 4 and 7 of R.A. 8249 violate their right to equal protection of the law
[33]
 because its enactment was particularly directed only to the 
Kuratong Baleleng
 cases in the 
Sandiganbayan
, is a contention too shallow to deserve merit.  No concrete evidence and convincing argument were presented to warrant a declaration of an act of the entire Congress and signed into law by the highest officer of the co-equal executive department as unconstitutional.  Every classification made by law is presumed reasonable.  Thus, the party who challenges the law must present proof of arbitrariness.
[34]
It is an established precept in constitutional law that the guaranty of the equal protection of the laws is not violated by a legislation based on reasonable classification.  The classification is reasonable and not arbitrary when there is concurrence of four elements, namely:
(1)
 it must rest on substantial distinction;
(2)
 it must be germane to the purpose of the law;
(3)
 must not be limited to existing conditions only, and
(4)
 must apply equally to all members of the same class,
[35]
all of which are present in this case.
The challengers of Sections 4 and 7 of R.A. 8249 failed to rebut the presumption of constitutionality and reasonableness of the questioned provisions.  The classification between those pending cases involving the concerned public officials whose trial has not yet commenced and whose cases could have been affected by the amendments of the 
Sandiganbayan
 jurisdiction under R.A. 8249, as against those cases where trial had already started as of the approval of the law, rests on substantial distinction that makes real differences.
[36]
 In the first instance, evidence against them were not yet presented, whereas in the latter the parties had already submitted their respective proofs, examined witness and presented documents.  Since it is within the power of Congress to define the jurisdiction of courts subject to the constitutional limitations,
[37]
 it can be reasonably anticipated that an alteration of that jurisdiction would necessarily affect pending cases, which is why it has to provide for a remedy in the form of a transitory provision.  Thus, petitioner and intervenors cannot now claim that Sections 4 and 7 placed them under a different category from those similarly situated as them.  Precisely, paragraph a of Section 4 provides that it shall apply to âall cases involving" certain public officials and, under the transitory provision in Section 7, to âall cases pending in any court.â  Contrary to petitioner and intervenorsâ arguments, the law is not particularly directed only to the 
Kuratong Baleleng
 cases.  The transitory provision does not only cover cases which are in the Sandiganbayan but also in â
any court
.â  It just happened that the 
Kuratong Baleleng
 cases are one of those affected by the law.  Moreover, those cases where trial had already begun are not affected by the transitory provision under Section 7 of the new law (R.A. 8249).
In their futile attempt to have said sections nullified, heavy reliance is premised on what is perceived as bad faith on the part of a Senator and two Justices of the 
Sandiganbayan
[38]
 for their participation in the passage of the said provisions.  In particular, it is stressed that the Senator had expressed strong sentiments against those officials involved in the 
Kuratong Baleleng
 cases during the hearings conducted on the matter by the committee headed by the Senator.  Petitioner further contends that the legislature is biased against him as he claims to have been selected from among the 67 million other Filipinos as the object of the deletion of the word âprincipalâ in paragraph a, Section 4 of P.D. 1606, as amended, and of the transitory provision of R.A. 8249.
[39]
 R.A. 8249, while still a bill, was acted, deliberated, considered by 23 other Senators and by about 250 Representatives, and was separately approved by the Senate and House of Representatives and, finally, by the President of the Philippines.
On the perceived bias that the 
Sandiganbayan
 Justices allegedly had against petitioner during the committee hearings, the same would not constitute sufficient justification to nullify an otherwise valid law.  Their presence and participation in the legislative hearings was deemed necessary by Congress since the matter before the committee involves the graft court of which one is the head of the 
Sandiganbayan
 and the other a member thereof.  The Congress, in its plenary legislative powers, is particularly empowered by the Constitution to invite persons to appear before it whenever it decides to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation.
[40]
Petitioner and intervenors further argued that the retroactive application of R.A. 8249 to the 
Kuratong Baleleng
 cases constitutes an 
ex post facto
 law
[41]
 for they are deprived of their right to procedural due process as they can no longer avail of the two tiered appeal which they had allegedly acquired under R.A. 7975.
Again, this contention is erroneous.  There is nothing 
ex post facto
 in R.A. 8249.  In 
Calder v. Bull
,
[42]
 an 
ex post facto
 law is one â  
(a)
which makes an act done criminal before the passing of the law and which was innocent when committed, and punishes such action; or
    
(b)
 which aggravates a crime or makes it greater that when it was committed; or
(c)
 
which changes the punishment and inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when it was committed,
(d)
 
which alters the legal rules of evidence and receives less or different testimony than the law required at the time of the commission of the offense in order to convict the defendant.
[43]
(e)
 
Every law which, in relation to the offense or its consequences, alters the situation of a person to his disadvantage.
[44]
This Court added two more to the list, namely:
(f)
 that which assumes to regulate civil rights and remedies only but in effect imposes a penalty or deprivation of a right which when done was lawful;
(g)
 
deprives a person accused of crime of some lawful protection to which he has become entitled, such as the protection of a former conviction or acquittal, or a proclamation of amnesty.
[45]
Ex post facto
 law, generally, prohibits retrospectivity of penal laws.
[46]
 R.A. 8249 is 
not
 a 
penal
 law.  It is a substantive law on jurisdiction which is not penal in character.  Penal laws are those acts of the Legislature which prohibit certain acts and establish penalties for their violations;
[47]
 or those that define crimes, treat of their nature, and provide for their punishment.
[48]
 R.A. 7975, which amended P.D. 1606 as regards the 
Sandiganbayanâs
 jurisdiction, its mode of appeal and other procedural matters, has been declared by the Court as not a penal law, but clearly a procedural statute, i.e. one which prescribes rules of procedure by which courts applying laws of all kinds can properly administer justice.
[49]
 Not being a penal law, the retroactive application of R.A. 8249 cannot be challenged as unconstitutional.
Petitionerâs and intervenorâs contention that their right to a two-tiered appeal which they acquired under R.A. 7975 has been diluted by the enactment of R.A. 8249, is incorrect.  The same contention has already been rejected by the court several times
[50]
 considering that the right to appeal is 
not
 a 
natural right
 but statutory in nature that can be regulated by law.  The mode of procedure provided for in the statutory right of appeal is not included in the prohibition against 
ex post facto
 laws.
[51]
 R.A. 8249 pertains only to matters of procedure, and being merely an amendatory statute it does not partake the nature of an 
ex post facto
 law.  It does not mete out a penalty and, therefore, does not come within the prohibition.
[52]
 Moreover, the law did not alter the rules of evidence or the mode of trial.
[53]
 It has been ruled that adjective statutes may be made applicable to actions pending and unresolved at the time of their passage.
[54]
In any case, R.A. 8249 has preserved the accusedâs right to appeal to the Supreme Court to review questions of law.
[55]
 On the removal of the intermediate review facts, the Supreme Court still has the power of review to determine if the presumption of innocence has been convincingly overcome.
[56]
Another point.  The challenged law does not violate the one-title-one-subject provisions of the Constitution.  Much emphasis is placed on the wording in the title of the law that it âdefinesâ the 
Sandiganbayan
 jurisdiction when what it allegedly does is to âexpandâ its jurisdiction.  The expansion in the jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
, if it can be considered as such, does not have to be expressly stated in the title of the law because such is the necessary consequence of the amendments.  The requirement that every bill must only have one subject expressed in the title
[57]
 is satisfied if the title is comprehensive enough, as in this case, to include subjects related to the general purpose which the statute seeks to achieve.
[58]
 Such rule is severally interpreted and should be given a practical rather than a technical construction.  There is here sufficient compliance with such requirement, since the title of R.A. 8249 expresses the general subject (involving the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan and the amendment of P.D. 1606, as amended) and all the provisions of the law are germane to that general subject.
[59]
 The Congress, in employing the word âdefineâ in the title of the law, acted within its powers since Section 2, Article VIII of the Constitution itself empowers the legislative body to â
define, prescribe
, and 
apportion
 the jurisdiction of various courtsâ.
[60]
There being no unconstitutional infirmity in both the subject amendatory provision of Section 4 and the retroactive procedural application of the law as provided in Section 7 R.A. No. 8249, we shall now determine whether 
under the allegations in the Informations
, it is the 
Sandiganbayan
 or Regional Trial Court which has jurisdiction over the multiple murder case against herein petitioner and intervenors.
The jurisdiction of a court is defined by the Constitution or statute.  The elements of that definition must appear in the complaint or information so as to ascertain which court has jurisdiction over a case.  Hence the elementary rule that the jurisdiction of a court is determined by the allegations in the complaint or information,
[61]
 and not by the evidence presented by the parties at the trial.
[62]
As stated earlier, the multiple murder charge against petitioner and intervenors falls under Section 4 [paragraph b] of R.A. 8249.  Section 4 requires that the offense charged must be committed by the offender 
in relation to his office 
in order for the 
Sandiganbayan
 to have jurisdiction over it.
[63]
 This jurisdictional requirement is in accordance with Section 5, Article XIII of the 1973 Constitution which mandated that the 
Sandiganbayan
 shall have jurisdiction over criminal cases committed by public officers and employees, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations, â
in relation to their office
 as may be determined by law.â  This constitutional mandate was reiterated in the new (1987) Constitution when it declared in Section 4 thereof that the 
Sandiganbayan
 "
shall continue to function and exercise its jurisdiction
 as now or hereafter may be provided by law.â
The remaining question to be resolved then is whether the offense of multiple murder was committed in relation to the office of the accused PNP officers.
In 
People vs. Montejo
,
[64]
 we held that an offense is said to have been committed 
in relation to the office
 if it (the offense) is âintimately connectedâ with the office of the offender and perpetrated while he was in the performance of his official functions.
[65]
 This intimate relation between the offense charged and the discharge of official duties â
must be alleged in the Information
.â
[66]
As to how the offense charged be stated in the information, Section 9, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court mandates:
âSEC. 9.  
Cause of Accusation
. â The acts or omissions complained of 
as constituting the offense 
must be stated in ordinary and concise language
 without repetition 
not necessarily in the terms of the statute defining the offense, but in such form as is sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is intended to be charged, and enable the court to pronounce proper judgment.
â  (Emphasis supplied)
As early as 1954, we pronounced that âthe factor that characterizes the charge is the 
actual recital of the facts.
â
[67]
 The real nature of the criminal charges is determined not from the caption or preamble of the information nor from the specification of the provision of law alleged to have been violated, 
they being conclusions of law
, but by the 
actual recital of facts
 in the complaint or information.â
[68]
The noble object of written accusations cannot be overemphasized.  This was explained in 
U.S. v. Karelsen
:
[69]
âThe object of this written accusations was â First, To furnish the accused with such a description of the charge against him as will enable him to make his defense, and second, to avail himself of his conviction or acquittal for protection against a further prosecution for the same cause, and third, to inform the court of the 
facts alleged
 so that it may decide whether they are sufficient in law to support a conviction if one should be had.  
In order that this requirement may be satisfied, facts must be stated, not conclusions of law 
 Every crime is made up of 
certain acts
 and 
intent
 
these must be set forth in the complaint with reasonable particularity
 of 
time, place, names 
(plaintiff and defendant) 
and circumstances.
  In short, 
the complaint 
must contain
 a 
specific
 
allegation
  of 
every fact
 and 
circumstance necessary to constitute the crime charged.
â (Emphasis supplied)
It is essential, therefore, that the accused be informed of the facts that are imputed to him as â
he is presumed to have no independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense.
â
[70]
Applying these legal principles and doctrines to the present case, we find the amended informations for murder against herein petitioner and intervenors wanting of 
specific factual
 averments to show the i
ntimate relation/connection
  between the 
offense charged
 and the 
discharge of official function
 of the offenders.
In the present case, one of the eleven (11) amended informations
[71]
 for murder reads:
âAMENDED INFORMATION

committing the acts in relation to office
 as officers and members of the Philippine National Police are charged herein as 
accessories after-the-fact
  for c
oncealing the crime herein above alleged
 by among others 
falsely representing that there were 
no arrests
 made during the 
raid
 conducted by the accused herein at Superville Subdivision, ParaÃ±aque, Metro Manila
 on or about the early dawn of May 18, 1995.
âCONTRARY TO LAWâ
While the above-quoted information states that the above-named principal accused committed the crime of murder âin relation to their public office, there is, however, 
no specific allegation of facts
 that the shooting of the victim by the said principal accused was 
intimately related
 to the discharge of their official duties as police officers.  Likewise, the amended information does not indicate that the said accused arrested and investigated the victim and then killed the latter while in their custody.
Even the allegations concerning the criminal participation of herein petitioner and intervenors as among the accessories after-the-fact, the amended information is vague on this.  It is alleged therein that the said accessories concealed the crime herein-above alleged by, among others, falsely representing that there were no arrests made during the raid conducted by the accused herein at Superville Subdivision, ParaÃ±aque, Metro Manila, on or about the early dawn of May 18, 1995.â  The sudden mention of the 
arrests
 made during the 
raid
 conducted by the accusedâ surprises the reader.  
There is no indication in the amended information that the victim was one of those arrested by the accused during the âraid.â
  Worse, the raid and arrests were allegedly conducted âat Superville Subdivision, 
ParaÃ±aque
, Metro Manilaâ but, as alleged in the immediately preceding paragraph of the amended information, the shooting of the victim by the principal accused occurred in Mariano Marcos Avenue, 
Quezon City
.â  How the raid, arrests and shooting happened in two places far away from each other is puzzling.  Again, while there is the allegation in the amended information that the said accessories committed the offense âin relation to office as officers and members of the (PNP),â we, however, do not see the intimate connection between the offense charged and the accusedâs official functions, which, as earlier discussed, is an essential element in determining the jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
.
The stringent requirement that the charge be set forth with such particularity as will reasonably indicate the exact offense which the accused is alleged to have committed in relation to his office was, sad to say, not satisfied.  We believe that the mere allegation in the amended information that the offense was committed by the accused public officer in relation to his officeâ is not sufficient.  That phrase is merely a 
conclusion of law
, not a 
factual
 averment that would show the close intimacy between the offense charged and the discharge of the accusedâs official duties.
In 
People vs. Magallanes
,
[72]
 where the jurisdiction between the Regional Trial Court and the 
Sandiganbayan
 was at issue, we ruled:
âIt is an elementary rule that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint or information and not by the result of evidence after trial.
âIn 
(People vs. ) Montejo
 (108 Phil 613 [1960]), where the amended information alleged
Leroy S. Brown, City Mayor of Basilan City, as such, has organized groups of police patrol and civilian commandos consisting of regular policemen and x x x special policemen, appointed and provided by him with pistols and high power guns and then established a camp x x x at Tipo-tipo which is under his command x x x supervision and control where his co-defendants were stationed, entertained criminal complaints and conducted the corresponding investigations, as well as assumed the authority to arrest and detain persons without due process of law and without bringing them to the proper court, and that in line with this set-up established by said Mayor of Basilan City as such, and acting upon his orders his co-defendants arrested and maltreated Awalin Tebag who died in consequence thereof.
we held that the offense charged was committed in relation to the office of the accused because it was perpetrated while they were in the performance, though improper or irregular of their official functions and would not have been committed had they not held their office, besides, the accused had no personal motive in committing the crime, thus, there was an intimate connection between the offense and the office of the accused.
âUnlike in 
Montejo
, the informations in Criminal Cases Nos. 15562 and 15563 in the court below do not indicate that the accused arrested and investigated the victims and then killed the latter in the course of the investigation.  The informations merely allege that the accused, for the purpose of extracting or extorting the sum of P353,000.00 abducted, kidnapped and detained the two victims, and failing in their common purpose, they shot and killed the said victims.  
For the purpose of determining jurisdiction, it is these allegations that shall control
, and not the evidence presented by the prosecution at the trial.â
In the aforecited case of 
People vs. Montejo
, it is noteworthy that the phrase committed in relation to public officeâ does not appear in the information, which only signifies that the said phrase is not what determines the jurisdiction of the 
Sandiganbayan
.  What is 
controlling
 is the 
specific factual allegations
 in the information that would indicate the close intimacy between the discharge of the accusedâs official duties and the commission of the offense charged, in order to qualify the crime as having been committed in relation to public office.
Consequently, for failure to show in the amended informations that the charge of murder was intimately connected with the discharge of official functions of the accused PNP officers, the offense charged in the subject criminal cases is plain murder and, therefore, within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court,
[73]
 not the 
Sandiganbayan
.
