THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. DELANO MENDIOLA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
D E C I S I O N




PER CURIAM:


For automatic review by this Court is the decision of the 
Regional Trial Court, Branch 166, Pasig City, finding the 
accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping his five-year
 old daughter and sentencing him the supreme penalty of death.

Upon a complaint filed by Consuelo Pedrosa in behalf of her 
granddaughter, Daryll Mendiola, the information for rape was filed which
 reads:



That sometime in the year 1994, in the City of Pasig, Philippines 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, with lewd designs and by means of force and intimidation, did 
then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual 
intercourse with a five (5) year old girl. Daryll Mendiola, his 
daughter, without her consent and against her will.
[1]






After trial, judgment was rendered on March 11, 1998 disposing, to wit:



WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused, Delano Mendiola, guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime charged in the Information, and 
considering that the victim, Daryll Mendiola, was then only five (5) 
years old and the daughter of the accused, he is hereby sentenced to 
suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH, and indemnify the victim the sum of
 P50,000.00, plus the costs of suit.
  


SO ORDERED.
[2]






As found by the trial court, the evidence for the prosecution is as follows:



Consuelo Pedrosa testified, in the main, that she is 63 years old; 
that the accused is the husband of her daughter Marlene; that the victim
 Daryll Mendiola, is the daughter of accused and Marlene; that Daryll 
was then only about a month old when she was brought by Marlene to Naga 
City and was entrusted to her care; that in 1994, Marlene went to Naga 
City and brought back Daryll in Pasig City; that in January 1995, Daryll
 was bitten by a dog, so that she brought her to Naga City for 
treatment; that in the same month when examined by Dr. Josephine Decena 
of the Bicol National Hospital, Daryll's hymen bore old lacerations at 
2, 6 and 8:00 o'clock positions; that Daryll was brought to the NBI 
Office in Naga City where her statement was taken; that when she told 
Marlene about the findings made by Dr. Decena and the taking of Daryll's
 statement by the NBI, Marlene got mad at her; that she is the one 
actively pursuing the instant case because Marlene refused to help 
Daryll.
  


Daryll Mendiola, private complainant, testified, inter alia, that 
she is six (6) years old; that her father is Delano Mendiola and her 
mother is Marlene; that in 1994 and 1995, inside their house in Pasig 
City, her father inserted his penis inside her vagina many times.
  


The documentary exhibits are:
  


"A......" - The Sworn Statement of Daryll Mendiola given to the NBI Investigator. 
"B" - Certification issued by Dr. Josephine Decena who examined Daryll Mendiola. 
"C" - Certificate of Live-Birth of Daryll Mendiola.
[3]






On the other hand, the evidence for the defense constitutes the following:



Delmar Mendiola testified, inter alia, that she is five (5) years 
old; that her parents are Delano and Marlene Mendiola; that Daryll 
Mendiola is her elder sister; that when she was four (4) years old she 
lived in their house in Pasig City, together with her parents, her 
sister Daryll and her brother JR; that while she, Daryll and Jr were the
 only ones in their house their cousin Gene, who is older than all of 
them, arrived; that after giving JR money for video game, Gene covered 
himself and Daryll with a blanket; that after removing Daryll's panty, 
Gene went on top of her; that after a while Gene left; that later on 
Daryll was brought by their grandmother to Bicol.
  


Accused Delano Mendiola, testified, among other things, that he is 
35 years old; that he was a fruit vendor at the Pasig Market; that he 
has 6 children; that in 1994, five (5) of his children, including Daryll
 were living with him in Pasig City; that prior to 1994, Daryll lived 
with her grandmother Consuelo Pedrosa, in Bicol; that in December, 1993,
 Daryll was brought by Consuelo to Pasig City and stayed in the house of
 his brother-in-law, Eugenio Babon; that when he went to the house of 
Eugenio to deliver some food stuff he saw Daryll and her cousin, Gene 
inside a room playing horsy-horsy; that because of what he saw he and 
his wife decided to get Daryll to stay with them; that while Daryll was 
living with them, he saw her playing with the penis of the dog; that he 
caught Daryll peeping while he and his wife were having sex; that his 
other children saw Daryll stick a "Walis Tingting" inside her vagina; 
that while Daryll was living with them, Gene was a frequent visitor; 
that in January 1995, Daryll was brought back to Bicol by her 
grandmother; that on January 3, 1996, he was arrested by the police in 
connection with the instant case; that his mother-in-law is mad at him 
and even advised his wife to split up with him because of marital 
problems. 


Marlene Mendiola testified, in the main, that she is 34 years old; 
that she is a fruit vendor at the Pasig City Market; that Daryll 
Mendiola is her fourth child and was born on July 25, 1989; that Delano 
Mendiola is her husband; that after her birth, Daryll was brought to 
Naga City by her grandmother, Consuelo, who took care of her; that in 
December, 1993, Daryll and Consuelo arrived in Pasig and stayed in the 
house of Eugenio Babon; that when she visited Daryll at Eugenio's 
residence, Consuelo told her that one time Daryll and Gene left the 
house and stayed out late and brought home plenty of candies and food 
bought by Gene, that she became suspicious of her nephew, Gene, so that 
she took Daryll home; that Gene was already about fourteen (14) years 
old at that time; that one noontime when she went home from the market 
she saw Gene, wearing shorts, on top of Daryll; that she tried to 
confront Gene but he scampered away; that she learned from her other 
children that Gene frequented their house; that in 1995, Daryll was 
bitten by a dog, so that she was brought to Bicol by her grandmother who
 again took care of her; that she was told by her sister, Teresita, to 
go to Bicol because a doctor found out that Daryll was a rape victim; 
that when the doctor inquired about their companions and neighbors, 
especially those who are about fourteen (14) years old, who could have 
sexually abused Daryll, she suspected Gene but her mother insisted that 
the culprit is her husband, Delano Mendiola; that her mother hated 
Delano because he is lazy and irresponsible; that her husband denied 
having raped their daughter.
[4]






The accused raises the following assignment of errors:



I
  


THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF 
THE CRIME OF RAPE BY RELYING HEAVILY ON THE TESTIMONY OF THE COMPLAINING
 VICTIM, DARYLL MENDOZA AND DISCREDITING TOTALLY THE VERSION OF THE 
DEFENSE.
  


II
  


THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE REVELATION OF 
DELMAR MENDIOLA THAT SHE ACTUALLY SAW HER COUSIN, JEN, WENT ON TOP OF 
HER SISTER, DARYLL, AFTER REMOVING THE LATTER'S PANTY.
[5]






As can be gleaned, the assigned errors hinge on the important issue 
of credibility of the witness. The defense asserts that the victim's 
testimony contains many loose ends considering that she could not even 
answer several questions propounded to her. On the other hand, the 
defense witness, Delmar Mendiola (whose nickname is "Macdo") although 
younger than Daryll was more proficient in court. Thus, her testimony 
should have been given more weight by the trial court.

It is settled that when the issue of credibility is concerned, 
the appellate court will generally not disturb the findings of the trial
 court, the latter being in a better position to describe the question, 
having heard the witnesses and observed the deportment and manner of 
testifying during the trial, unless certain facts of substance and value
 had been placidly overlooked which, if considered, might affect the 
result of the case.
[6]


Daryll lived with her grandmother in Naga City one month after 
she was born in 1989. She was already five years old when she was taken 
back by her mother in order to live with them in Pasig City in 1994. In 
January, 1995, she was brought back again to Naga City for treatment 
because she was bitten by a dog. While in her grandmother's custody, the
 child complained of pain in the genitalia during urination and bathing.
 OB-GYNE examinations yielded old hymenal lacerations and vaginal 
infection. It was also during this time that her grandmother observed 
the child to be acting strangely and violently which included: 
hyperirritability, aggressiveness, biting, masturbatory acts and violent
 tendencies. She was referred for psychological management and these 
were the observations:



Course of OPD Consultations:
  


From the time the patient was initially seen on Jan.24, 1995, she 
was asked to come for regular weekly follow-ups. She was initially 
observed to be very aggressive and irritable. She kept on throwing 
things and boxing her grandmother while the session was going on. She 
was very hostile to anybody and was uncooperative. She was started on 
Tofranil 25 mg HS and was scheduled for a series of psychological 
testing. Despite some difficulties encountered during the testing 
proper, she was able to finish the examinations conducted.
  


During the succeeding follow-ups, her medications were further 
increased and an additional mood stabilizer was given. Her behavior 
somehow improved. In one of the sessions conducted with her, she made 
mention that it was her father who allegedly sexually abused her. She 
said it was done on several occasions while she was still living in 
Pasig. The same information was revealed to the psychologist.
  


The mother paid her a short visit sometime in the 3rd week of 
February and after she left a week after, the child was again noted to 
show (sic) aggressive and hostile tendencies. With the aid of 
psychotherapeutic intervention the child is at present manageable.
  


Psychiatric Evaluation Results:
  


In view of the foregoing examination and findings, the patient was 
found to be suffering from ADJUSTMENT DISORDER, WITH DISRUPTIVE 
BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS AND DEPRESSIVE FEATURES. She is negative for any 
psychotic conditions.
[7]






The defense claims that Daryll, when put to the witness stand, was 
unable to answer some questions. It also asserts that the testimony of a
 child of tender years (referring to Daryll) must be admitted with great
 caution and where there is doubt, should be excluded.
[8]


The victim's failure to answer some questions is understandable. 
She was only five (5) years old when the rape took place and six (6) 
years old when she was put on the witness stand. Apart from this, she is
 a disturbed child who had disruptive behavioral symptoms. However, such
 conditions did not materially affect her credibility. When Daryll was, 
however, asked the material question of what her father did to her, she 
answered clearly, candidly and categorically that the accused-appellant 
inserted his penis inside her vagina several times.
[9]
 It is an accepted precept that testimonies of child victims who are young and immature are given full weight and credit.
[10]

 When a woman or a girl-child says that she has been raped, she says in 
effect all that is necessary to show that rape was indeed committed.

xxx.
[12]






A rape victim who testifies in a categorical, straightforward, 
spontaneous and frank manner and remains consistent is a credible 
witness.
[13]
 The lone 
testimony of the victim, which if credible and free from any serious and
 material contradictions, as in this case, is enough basis for the 
accused-appellant's prosecution and conviction.
[14]

 Thus, the trial court did not err when it found with moral certainty 
that the accused-appellant was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the 
crime charged.

To save himself, the accused points at his nephew, Gene (Jen) 
Babon, a 13 or 14-year old boy as the one who committed the rape. To 
substantiate this assertion, the defense presented the victim's younger 
sister, Macdo to testify that she saw Gene remove the panty of Daryll, 
covered himself and Daryll with a blanket, and put himself on top of 
Daryll.
[15]
 The victim's 
mother, Marlene Mendiola corroborated Macdo's testimony and told the 
court that Gene frequented their house, brought food and candies and 
gave money in order to drive away the other sibling from the house in 
order to have carnal knowledge with Daryll.
[16]

 The trial court, however, did not give credence to Macdo's testimony 
considering that she was a coached witness. Upon cross examination, she 
stated, to wit:



ATTY. LANOT:
  


Mr. (sic) Witness, this incident you are telling the court, when did this happen?
  


ATTY. ANTONANO:
  


May we ask counsel to be specific with the question. What incident?
  


ATTY. LANOT:
  


By Jean and Daryll.
  


A That was a long time ago.
  


Q And you could not remember what happened then?
      

      A Hindi na po.
  


Q And what you are telling the court is what your mother told you, is it not?
      

      A Yes, sir.
  


Q And there were many times that your mother was telling you 
repeatedly, is it not? What [did] your mother told (sic) you, to tell 
the court?
  


COURT:
  


Q What you told the court was everything your mother told you repeatedly, is it not?
      

      A Yes, sir.
  


xxx.
[17]






Nonetheless, there is actually nothing in Macdo's testimony from 
which to conclude that Gene had sexual intercourse with Daryll. On 
cross-examination by the prosecution, Macdo stated that she did not 
actually see what Gene and Daryll were doing under the blanket. Her 
testimony, therefore, cannot stand up to exculpate her father of the 
crime charged. The trial court, thus, correctly ruled:



xxx.
  


Accused's defense to the effect that Daryll's hymenal laceration, 
if not self-inflicted, were the result of her horsy-horsy game with her 
cousin Gene, suffers from inherent vulnerability and generates total 
disbelief. Daryll could not have punctured and lacerated her hymen with 
the use of a stick or "walis Tingting" because the pain would have been 
unbearable especially to a 5-year old child. In putting the blame on 
Gene, the defense makes capital of the testimony of Delmar Mendiola to 
the effect that one time Gene covered himself and Daryll with a blanket,
 removed Daryll's panty and fucked her. A...... meticulous analysis of 
the testimony of Delmar will, however, show that the same is not worthy 
of faith and credence. On Cross-examination, Delmar admitted that she 
was coached by her mother and that all she stated was taught by her 
mother (TSN, p. 11, Oct. 10, 1996). In answer to the clarificatory 
questions of the court, Daryll stated that she did not see what Gene and
 Daryll did under the blanket (TSN, 17 and 18, Supra.) The testimony of 
accused (TSN, p. 4, Nov. 23, 1996) and that of Marlene Mendiola (TSN, p.
 5, Aug. 6, 1997) that they saw, on different occasions, Gene, fully 
clothed, on top of Daryll, even if true, are no more than suspicion, 
speculation or surmise that Gene had carnal knowledge of Daryll, and are
 utterly insufficient to rebut the evidence of the prosecution.
[18]






Moreover, it is difficult to accept the version of the defense that 
it was Gene who was responsible for the defloration of Daryll. Consuelo 
Pedrosa testified that her grandson, Gene was childish, having suffered 
meningitis when he was six years old and could hardly talk.
[19]

 If indeed Gene committed rape on Daryll, such incident would have made 
an unforgettable impression on her mind. It is a most natural reaction 
for victims of criminal violence to have a lasting impression of the 
manner in which the crime was committed and the identity of the person 
who was responsible therefor.
[20]

 On the witness stand, when the questions propounded were focused on 
Gene, Daryll did not manifest any untoward reaction regarding her cousin
 which would lead the court to believe that she was afraid of Gene. 
Moreover, she categorically denied that Gene put himself on top of her:



Q When your father is not in the house, do you remember of any other person coming to your house?
      

      A Nobody.
  


Q Even Gene, a relative of yours is not in the house?
      

      A He does enter the house.
  


Q And do you know this Gene?
      

      A Yes I know.
  


Q This Gene, you have played with him before in the house of your Uncle?
      

      A No sir, we did not.
  


Q But by the way, do you know if how old is this Gene?
      

      A He is older than me.
  


xxx
  


Q This Gene, did he have any occasion to put his self (sic) on top of you?
      

      A None ma'm.
  


Q And was there a time that you were together covering yourself with a blanket?
      

      A No ma'm.
  


Q By the way, who is this Gene, do you have any relation with him?
      

      A I only know him ma'm.
  


xxx.
[21]






On the other hand, when she was asked what her father did to her, she
 answered in a straightforward manner that he inserted his penis into 
her vagina many times and that it became reddish and painful.
[22]
 This incident happened in their house in Pasig City:



QUESTIONS FROM THE COURT:
  


Q By the way your father according to you, put his sex organ inside yours, where did he do it?
      

      A Inside the house, sir.
  


Q And where was this house located?
      

      A In Pasig sir.
  


Q According to you, your father did this for many times, can you tell us the place where your father did this to you?
      

      A In the house sir.
  


Q Where is this house.
      

      A In Pasig sir.

[23]






The accused was a drug user who was once confined in a rehabilitation center where he met his wife, Marlene Pedrosa.
[24]
 As testified by the victim, her father was using shabu taken from the aparador.
[25]

 This allegation was never disputed. We agree with the observation of 
the Solicitor General that "a person under the influence of shabu or 
prohibited drugs is capable of committing the most base and vile act."
[26]


Furthermore, the accused asserts that the complaint filed by 
Daryll's grandmother against him was ill-motivated as she did not 
approve of him to be her daughter's husband. While Consuelo Pedrosa did 
admit that she was mad at her son-in-law because he was maltreating her 
daughter, Marlene,
[27]
 that 
was too flimsy a reason for her to concoct a story of rape on her 
granddaughter. It is unbelievable that a grandmother would expose her 
innocent granddaughter to humiliation and stigma of a rape trial just to
 discontinue the relationship between the accused and her daughter.

 Consuelo Pedrosa had taken care of Daryll since infancy. The interest 
and welfare of the child was her main concern which is why she pursued 
the case against the accused since Marlene did not want to help her 
daughter.

Rape is such an abominable act especially when it is committed by
 a father on his minor daughter. We understand the defense's grim 
determination to escape the harsh punishment of death.
[29]
 The law may be exceedingly hard but so the law is written and the Court is duty bound to apply it.
[30]


In line with the prevailing jurisprudence, an indemnity of 
P75,000.00 is awardable to the victim, the rape being qualified by any 
of the circumstances under which the death penalty is authorized by the 
applicable amendatory law.
[31]

 In addition, an award of P50,000 as moral damages is granted without 
the need of proof of the basis thereof. Nonetheless, the victim in the 
case at bar is entitled to the award considering that she was found to 
be suffering from "Adjustment Disorder, with Disruptive Behavioral 
Symptoms and Depressive Features"
[32]
 as a result of the sexual assault done to her by her father.

Four members of the Court are steadfast in their adherence that 
R.A. 7659 is unconstitutional insofar as it prescribed the death 
penalty. However, they bow to the majority opinion that the said law is 
constitutional and thereunder, the imposition of the death penalty is 
proper.

WHEREFORE
, the Decision, dated March 11, 1998 of
 the RTC, Pasig City, Branch 166, finding accused-appellant Delano 
Mendiola guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape against his
 5-year old daughter Daryll and sentencing him to suffer the supreme 
penalty of death, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION. Accused-appellant is 
ordered to pay the offended party the amount of P75,000.00 as civil 
indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.

Upon finality of this decision, let the Records of this case be 
forthwith forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise
 of his pardoning power.

SO ORDERED.
