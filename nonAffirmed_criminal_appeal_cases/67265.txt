INTING, J.:


This is a Petition
[1]
 for Review on 
Certiorari
 from the Decision
[2]
 dated September 6, 2011 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 01262 which affirmed the Decision
[3]

 dated June 9, 2009 of Branch 14, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Baybay, 
Leyte finding Pedrito Valenzona (petitioner) guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of nine (9) counts of Acts of Lasciviousness defined under Article
 336 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in relation to Section S(b) of 
Republic Act No. (RA) 7610. 


The Antecedents


The instant case stemmed from nine (9) Informations charging petitioner 
with Attempted Rape. The Informations, except for the date of the 
commission of each crime, similarly read as follows:


On June 10, 1998, in Baybay, Leyte and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with 
deliberate intent, with lewd and prurient desires, laid on top of 
11-year old AAA upon whom he exercised moral ascendancy she being his 
grade sixth pupil, after he pulled down her underwear up to below her 
knee, and executed some pumping acts and motions with his male organ on 
her pubic area while at the same time embracing and kissing her, but 
accused's male organ was not able to penetrate nor touch the labia of 
the pudendum, accused performed overt acts but did not perform all the 
acts of execution which constitute the crime of rape due to the fact 
that the victim's thighs remained close together thereby protecting her 
female organ, although accused ejaculated by reason of the excitement at
 the moment.

Contrary to law.
[4]


The crimes were allegedly committed on the following dates: (1) June 10, 1998;
[5]
 (2) June 16, 1998;
[6]
 (3) June 19, 1998;
[7]
 (4) June 23, 1998;
[8]
 (5) June 26, 1998;
[9]
 (6) July 8, 1998;
[10]
 (7) July 23, 1998;
[11]
 (8) July 24, 1998;
[12]
 and (9) July 30, 1998.
[13]
 


During the arraignment on October 16, 2001 petitioner pleaded not guilty to the crimes charged.
[14]
 Trial on the merits ensued. 


Version of the Prosecution
 


The victim in the cases is AAA,
[15]

 who was 11 years old when petitioner repeatedly sexually abused her. 
Petitioner, on the other hand, was AAA's Grade VI teacher. All the nine 
incidents of Attempted Rape were committed inside the computer room of 
Franciscan College of Immaculate Conception (FCIC) in Baybay, Leyte 
where petitioner was a teacher and AAA was a Grade VI student, to wit: 


Criminal Case No. B-2107

On June 10, 1998, between 9 to 10 a.m. [sic] appellant excused [AAA] 
from her class and ordered her to encode into the computer some school 
campaign materials. While inside the computer room, appellant asked 
Lycelle Kirong, the only other person inside the computer room, to get 
some bond papers. Appellant locked the door behind Lycelle and 
approached [AAA] to kiss her lips and cheeks. [AAA] tried to resist but 
appellant forced her into submission. Appellant pulled [AAA] toward a 
table and made her lie on top of it. While continuing to kiss [AAA], 
appellant proceeded to pull down [AAA's] underwear to her knees and 
raised her skirt. Appellant went on top of [AAA] and made a pumping 
motion while at the same time kissing her. [AAA] kept her thighs tight 
hence, appellant failed to penetrate her vagina. After a while, 
appellant ejaculated. [AAA] did not resist nor shout because appellant 
is her teacher. Appellant stopped when Lycelle knocked at the door x x 
x.



Criminal Case No. B-2108



 On June 16, 1998, between 9 to 10 a.m., appellant sunrmoned [AAA] 
inside the computer room of FCIC. Once inside, appellant made [AAA]lie 
down on top of a table, pulled her underwear to her knees, pulled down 
his pants and underwear to his knees, mounted her, then made some 
pumping motions while kissing [AAA] until he ejaculated x x x.



Criminal Case No. B-2109


 On June 19, 1998, just like the previous sexual molestations, 
appellant sunrmoned [AAA] inside the computer [r]oom to encode some 
work. Then, appellant made [AAA]lean on the table, embraced and kissed 
her. [AAA] tried to resist but appellant was too strong for her. 
Appellant touched [AAA's] breast and made her lie down on one of the 
tables x x x.



Criminal Case no. B-2110



 On June 23, 1998, appellant sexually abused [AAA] inside the same 
computer room in same manner as she was sexually abused by the appellant
 in the previous incidents, i.e., made her lie down on top of a table, 
pulled down her underwear to her knees, kissed and embraced her, 
executed some pumping motions with the sexual organ of appellant 
touching [AAA's] pubic area until appellant. ejaculated x x x:


 Criminal Case No. B-2111



On June 26, 1998, between 9 to 10 a.m., appellant made [AAA]lie on 
top of a table inside the computer room at FCIC. When she and appellant 
were half naked, the latter mou11ted her and made som10 pumping motions.
 Appellant kissed [AAA] on her lips and touched her vagina. Appellant 
ejaculated while making some more pumping motions on top of her x x x.



Criminal Case No. B-2112


 On July 8, 1998 appellant again summoned [AAA] to the FCIC's 
computer room. Inside said room, appellant forced [AAA] to kiss him, 
made her lie down on top of a table, pulled down her underwear, lifted 
her skirt, pulled down his pants and underwear, mounted her, made some 
pumping motions until he ejaculated x x x.



Criminal Case No. B-2113

On July 23, 1998, once [AAA] was 


inside the same computer room at FCIC, appellant locked the door, 
approached [AAA] and kissed her on the lips. He then pulled her towards a
 table and made her lie down on top of it; that while she was lying 
down, appellant pulled down her underwear below her knees, mounted her, 
did some pumping motions while kissing her lips until he ejaculated x x 
x.



Criminal Case No. B-2114


 On July 24, 1998, appellant asked [AAA] to finish the task he 
assigned to her the previous day. Once inside the computer room, 
appellant repeated what he did to [AAA] the day before (July 23, 1998); 
i.e
.,
 he pulled her towards a table made her lie down on top of it; while she
 was lying down, lifted her skirt; appellant also pulled down his pants 
and underwear up to his knees, mounted her and did some pumping motions 
while kissing her on the lips until he ejaculated x x x.



Criminal Case No. B-2115


 On July 30, 1998, [AAA] and Harvey Managbanag went to the computer 
room upon the instruction of Mrs. Bactasa to encode in the computer the 
program for the Linggo ng Wika. Upon seeing Harvey, appellant got angry 
prompting Harvey to leave the computer room. While [AAA] was encoding 
the program of the Linggo ng Wika, appellant approached her, made her 
stand up then made her lie down on top of the table. He placed himself 
on top of [AAA], went down and pulled [AAA's] underwear below her knees.
 Thereafter,appellant also pulled down his pants and underwear below his
 knees and placed himself on top of her. He made some pumping motions 
until he ejaculated x x x. 
[16]




AAA's ordeals in the hands of petitioner caused her sleepless nights.
 She started to have difficulty in concentrating in her studies. BBB, 
the mother of AAA, noticed her unusual behavior. Thus, BBB confronted 
AAA. After AAA confessed and related to BBB the dastardly acts 
petitioner committed against her, both AAA and BBB reported the incident
 to the school principal and to the police.
[17]


 For his part, petitioner denied the allegations against him. He 
refuted the imputations against him as follows:

On June 10, 1998, it was impossible for him to sexually abuse AAA as it 
was not yet the student leaders' election period; hence, he had no 
reason to ask AAA to encode the campaign materials.


 On June 16 and 19, 1998, it was not possible for him to sexually 
abuse AAA in the computer room as the room was closed because the 
computers were "out of order." He could not have committed the crime on 
June 23, 1998 as he was busy preparing for the school student leaders' 
election. It was likewise impossible for him to sexually abuse AAA on 
June 26, 1998 as there was an ongoing mass that he participated in at 
the time of the alleged commission of the crime. On July 8, 1998, he was
 conducting a reading lesson with his Grade V class. On July 23, 1998, 
the computer room was locked as the computers needed some repairs. On 
July 24, 1998, he was in the school canteen with the other teachers 
practicing their dance number for the school's induction of officers. On
 July 30, 1998, he conducted a long quiz with his Grade V students.
[18]


 Petitioner asserted that AAA accused him of several counts of 
Attempted Rape because he scolded her for not remitting the funds of the
 student body.
[19]


The RTC Ruling


The RTC convicted petitioner of nine (9) counts of Acts of 
Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) 
of RA 7610. For each count, the RTC sentenced petitioner to suffer the 
penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years of 
prision mayor
, as minimum, to sixteen (16) years of 
reclusion temporal
,
 as maximum. The RTC likewise ordered petitioner to pay AAA P100,000.00 
as moral damages and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of 
Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to 
Section 5(b) ofRA 7610.
[20]
 


The RTC convicted petitioner of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 
336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610 instead of 
Attempted Rape. It found that in all nine occasions that petitioner 
sexually abused AAA, there was no evidence that he had the intention of 
having sexual intercourse with the latter.
[21]
 According to the RTC, there was no statement from AAA that petitioner tried to insert his penis into her vagina.
[22]

 The RTC ratiocinated that petitioner merely satisfied his lust by 
mounting himself half-naked over the half-naked body of AAA until he 
ejaculated.
[23]




The CA Ruling


In the Decision
[24]
 dated 
September 6, 2011, the CA affirmed the RTC with modifications as to the 
damages awarded. Thus, the CA ordered petitioner to pay AAA P20,000.00 
as civil indemnity, P30,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as 
exemplary damages for each count of Acts of Lasciviousness. The CA 
likewise ordered petitioner to pay AAA P25,000.00 as attorney's fees 
with cost against him.
[25]
 


Hence, the petition.


Petitioner raised the issue of whether theCA erred in affirming his conviction. 




The Court's Ruling


The petition has no merit.


Well-settled is the rule that the matter of ascribing substance to 
the testimonies of witnesses is best discharged by the trial court, and 
the appellate courts will not generally disturb the findings of the 
trial court in this respect.
[26]

 "[F]indings of the trial court which are factual in nature and which 
involve the credibility of witnesses are accorded with respect, if not 
finality by the appellate court, when no glaring errors, gross 
misapprehension of facts, and speculative, arbitrary, and unsupported 
conclusions can be gathered from such fmdings."
[27]

 The reason is quite simple: the trial judge is in a better position to 
ascertain the conflicting testimonies of witnesses after having heard 
them and observed their deportment and mode of testifying during the 
trial.
[28]
 "The task of taking
 on the issue of credibility is a function properly lodged with the 
trial court." Thus, generally, the Court will not re-examine or 
re-evaluate evidence that had been analyzed and ruled upon by the trial 
court.


 After a judicious perusal of the records of the instant petition, 
the Court finds no compelling reason to depart from the uniform factual 
fmdings of the RTC and the CA. The Court affirms petitioner's 
conviction.


The RTC and theCA correctly convicted the petitioner of nine (9) 
counts of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 in relation to 
Section 5(b) of RA 7610.
[29]
 


For a successful prosecution of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC, the following elements must concur: 


 
 
 
(1)
 
 That the offender commits any act oflasciviousness or lewdness; (2) That it is done under any of the following circumstances: 
 
 
 
 
a) 
 
Through force, threat or intimidation;
 
 
 
 
b) 
 
Where the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;
 
 
 
 
c) 
 
By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;
 
 
 
 
d)
 
 
When
 the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, 
even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present; and
 
 
 
(3)
 
 That the offended party is another person of either sex.30
 
 
 


On the other hand, the essential elements of sexual abuse under 
Section 5(b) of RA 7610 are as follows: (1) the accused commits the act 
of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the said act is 
performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other 
sexual abuse; and, (3) the child, whether male or female, is below 18 
years of age.
[31]
 A child is deemed subjected to "
other sexual abuse
" when he or she indulges in lascivious conduct under the coercion or influence of any adult.
[32]
 Section 2(h) of the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases
[33]
 defines 
lascivious conduct

 as the "intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of 
the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the 
introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any 
person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, 
humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of 
any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the 
genitals or pubic area of a person."
[34]


 All of the aforementioned elements were sufficiently established by 
the prosecution. AAA's minority had been sufficiently established with 
the presentation of her Certificate of Live Birth
[35]

 showing that she was born on November 15, 1986. Thus, it is undisputed 
that AAA was only 11 years old during the commission of the crimes 
against her person. Evidence likewise reveals that petitioner was then 
the Grade VI teacher of AAA in FCIC, and therefore, a person who 
exercised moral ascendancy and influence upon her. Finally, AAA clearly 
testified how the separate counts of Acts of Lasciviousness under 
Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610 were 
committed. She categorically stated that petitioner kissed her, touched 
her private parts while she was lying on top of the table in the 
computer room, and that he repeatedly made pumping motions after he 
removed his pants and lifted her skirt until he ejaculated. The 
prosecution had likewise emphasized that petitioner's penis never 
penetrated AAA's vagina in any of the sexual incidents. These 
established facts show that petitioner committed the acts with lewd 
desires and that his lascivious conduct subjected AAA to sexual abuse. 
Because there was neither an insertion nor an attempt to insert 
petitioner's penis or any object into AAA's vagina,
[36]

 petitioner's conviction of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of 
the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610 and not Attempted Rape is
 in order. Even the Informations alleged that "
accused's male organ was not able to penetrate nor touch the labia of the pudendum
."


 Petitioner argues that he cannot be convicted of nine counts of Acts
 of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 
5(b) of RA 7610 as he was merely charged with nine counts of Attempted 
Rape. Thus, he insists that his constitutional right to be informed of 
the nature and cause of accusation against him was violated.


The argument is specious.


The crime of Acts of Lasciviousness is necessarily included in the 
offense of rape, thus, petitioner can be convicted of a lesser crime.
[37]
 This is in accordance with the variance doctrine enunciated under Section 4
[38]
 in relation to Section 5
[39]
 of Rule 120 of the Rules on CrimÂ­ inal Procedure.
[40]
 


Hence, even though the crime charged against petitioner is for 
Attempted Rape, he can be convicted of the crime of Acts of 
Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC without violating his conÂ­ 
stitutional rights because the latter is necessarily included in the 
crime of Attempted Rape.
[41]
 


Moreover, petitioner insists that the CA erred in giving credence to 
AAA's statements which are incredible considering that the alleged nine 
incidents occurred in the same place, at the same time, and in the same 
manner.


The contention holds no water.


The precise date and time of the incidents are not among the elements of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of RA 7610.
[42]
 The date given in the complaint need not even be proven as alleged if it is not the essence of the crime
[43]

 as in the case at bench. Thus, the complaint will be sustained if the 
proof shows that the crime was committed at any date within the period 
of the statute of limitations and before the commencement of the action.
[44]
 Likewise, it is recognized that lust is no respecter of time and place.
[45]

 Sexual abuse can thus be committed even in places where people 
congregate, in parks, along the roadside, within school premises, inside
 a house where there are other occupants, and even in the same room 
where other members of the family are also sleeping.
[46]


 Finally, petitioner faults AAA for not immediately revealing the 
alleged incidents to her friends, classmates, teachers or school 
personnel after their commission. Time and again, the Court has held 
that there is no uniform behavior that can be expected from those who 
had the misfortune of being sexually molested.
[47]
 The Court ruled: 


x x x While there are some who may have fonnd the courage
 early on to reveal the abuse they experienced, there are those who have
 opted to initially keep the harrowing ordeal to themselves and attempt 
to move on with their lives. This is because a rape victim's actions are
 oftentimes overwhelmed by fear rather than by reason. The perpetrator 
of the rape hopes to build a climate of extreme psychological terror, 
which would numb his victim into silence and submissiveness. In fact, 
incestuous rape further magnifies this terror, for the perpetrator in 
these cases, such as the victim's father, is a person normally expected 
to give solace and protection to the victim. Moreover, in incest, access
 to the victim is guaranteed by the blood relationship, magnifying the 
sense of helplessness and the degree of fear.
[48]




Without a doubt, neither does AAA.'s silence immediately after the 
incidents nor her failure to shout during the commission of the crimes 
affect her credibility as a witness. Victims of sexual abuse, like AAA, 
react differently to different situations. There is no standard form of 
reaction for a woman when facing a shocking and horrifying experience 
such as sexual abuse.
[49]
 


As to the penalty imposed, the Court modifies the CA Decision. 
Section 5(b) ofRA 7610 provides that the penalty for lascivious conduct 
when the victim is under 12 years of age shall be 
reclusion temporal

 in its medium period which ranges from fourteen (14) years, eight (8) 
months and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months.


Here, in the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, 
the maximum term of the sentence to be imposed shall be taken from the 
medium period of 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period which 
ranges from fifteen (15) years, six (6) months, and twenty (20) days to 
sixteen (16) years, five (5) months, and nine (9) days.
[50]
 On the other hand, the minimum term shall be taken from the penalty next lower to 
reclusion temporal

 medium that is reclusion temporal minimum which ranges from twelve (12)
 years and one (1) day to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months.

Hence, from the foregoing, the penalty imposed by the RTC as affirmed by
 the CA for each count of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of 
the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610 which is twelve (12) 
years of 
prision mayor
, as minimum to sixteen (16) years of 
reclusion temporal
, as maximum, should be modified to conform to jurisprudence.
[51]
 Accordingly, petitioner is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) day of 
reclusion temporal
 in its minimum period, as minimum to fifteen (15) years six (6) months and twenty (20) days of 
reclusion temporal
 in its medium period as maximum.


It is worthy to emphasize that the nomenclature of the crime as ruled
 by the RTC and CA is still Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of 
the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610. It is settled in the 
case of 
People v. Tulagan
[52]
 (
Tulagan
)
 that when the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness is committed against a 
victim who is under 12 years old or is demented, the proper nomenclature
 of the crime is Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in 
relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610. Here, evidence reveals that AAA was
 11 years old
[53]
 when the 
nine (9) counts of Acts of Lasciviousness were committed against her. 
Hence, the RTC and the CA correctly convicted petitioner of Acts of 
Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) 
of RA 7610.


 Lastly, the award of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary 
damages in favor of AAA, should be increased to P50,000.00 each in view 
of the recent pronouncement in 
Tulagan
.
[54]
 Likewise, a fme in the amount of P15,000.00 is imposed.
[55]
 Additionally, all the monetary awards shall earn a legal interest of 6% 
per annum
 from the date of the finality of this Decision until fully paid.
[56]
 The award of attorney's fees is deleted for want of legal and factual basis.
