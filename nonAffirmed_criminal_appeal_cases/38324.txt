PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. PEDRO DUCTA @ PETER DUCTA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.

D E C I S I O N




VITUG, J.:


An appeal was interposed from the decision of
 the Regional Trial Court, 
Branch 52, of Sorsogan, Sorsogon, finding accused-appellant Pedro Ducta,
 a.k.a. Peter Ducta, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape
 and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of 
reclusion 
perpetua
 and to pay the amount of P50,000.00 by way of civil 
indemnity to the victim.


The information filed by the provincial prosecution against 
accused-appellant read:



 âThat on or about the 10th day of August, 1996, at barangay 
Sampaloc, municipality of Sorsogon, province of Sorsogon, Philippines, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, with lewd designs, by means of force and intimidation, did then
 and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, had carnal knowledge 
of one ERLINDA CLAR, a mentally retarded girl, against the victim's 
will, to her damage and prejudice of said victim. 


 "CONTRARY TO LAW."
[1]







The accused, when arraigned before the trial court on 07 January 1997, 
entered a plea of "not guilty.â


The facts submitted by the prosecution and the defense, found by the 
trial court, were reflected in the ponencia under review.



 "Ester de los Santos Brondial testified that on August 10, 
1996 at
 about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon, more or less while she was in her 
store at Market Site, Sorsogon, Sorsogon, decided to go home.  When she 
reached home, the door of her house was locked so she pushed it hard and
 as it opened, she saw the accused Pedro Ducta on top of her daughter 
doing sexual intercourse by moving his buttocks up and down.  At first, 
she was shocked but after few seconds, she was able to get hold of a 
bamboo slot and hit him with it.  Accused did not fight back but tried 
to ask forgiveness.  According to said witness, when she left for her 
store, she left her daughter alone as she is mentally retarded.  Her 
daughter is already 43 years old and from morning till afternoon, she 
just sat down.  She sent her to school but stayed three years in Grade I
 and she learned only how to make circle.  That she shouted for 
policeman, and Kagawad Norberto Mateos and Domingo Polinag arrived in 
her house.  That same day, she brought her daughter to Dr. Humilde 
Janaban, and a medical certificate was issued which was marked as Exh. 
A. Erlinda Clar when called to the witness stand and when asked if she 
knew the accused answered in the affirmative and when asked why she knew
 him, she answered because he went up the house and when asked what did 
he do, she answered, he removed his clothes and after removing his 
clothes when asked what did he do, witness made a sign meaning sexual 
intercourse by placing her thumb in between her forefinger and middle 
finger and when asked to whom did he do that, she answered she was the 
one, pointing to herself. 


 "Dr. Humilde Janaban testified that when she examined the 
victim, her findings were: 


 "Physical Examination: 


 "Vagina admits 2 fingers with ease with old hymenal 
laceration at 6:00, 3:00 & 9:00 positions; 


 "Erythema and abrasions at the urethra, with minimal whitish
 vaginal discharge (Exh. A). 


 "According to the doctor, the hymenal laceration can be due 
to 
sexual intercourse and the erythema and abrasions at the urethra could 
have been caused also by sexual intercourse.  And she also testified 
that the erythema and abrasions at the urethra is recent, that is, it 
could be hours before the examination.  She further testified that when 
she examined the victim, she noticed that she is having abnormal mental 
status, meaning she is in the form of psychiatric patient, she was 
answering most of the time, when she would ask question, victim would 
smile, in short she is not normal as far as mental status is concerned. 



 âThe defense presented the accused and Nena Despabaladeras 
whose testimony is to wit: 


 "That on August 10, 1996 at about 3:00 o'clock in the 
afternoon he
 was at a roadside in front of the house of the complainant in Sampaloc,
 Sorsogon, Sorsogon, having just finished washing his tricycle.  While 
thereat, he was called by Ester de los Santos Brondial, his neighbor and
 requested him to bring outside her house the bananas.  That while they 
were talking, Nena Despabiladeras passed by and when asked by him, where
 she is going, she answered she is going to the market.  That he went up
 the house and saw five boxes of bananas on the floor.  Because he does 
not know the box he will carry, he went down the house to ask Ester de 
los Santos what to carry but when he met her on the door way, said Ester
 de los Santos went up and hit him with a bamboo stick hitting him in 
the head and at the same time uttering 'you are a thief, a rapist.â He 
tried to pacify Ester de los Santos, telling her why she is doing that 
to him when he did not do anything wrong.  Ester de los Santos continued
 talking and so what he did, he just sit down.  She continued shouting 
in the window.  âHere is the thief, here is the rapist.â Then Kagawad 
Norbeto Mateos and Kagawad Domingo Polinag arrived.  When asked by 
Norberto Mateos, Ester answered that she came upon this Peter who was 
standing, and she don't know what he was doing.  The two suggested to 
Ester to have her child examined by the doctor and the incident placed 
in the police blotter.  When the police arrived he was brought to the 
station and he was detained. 


 "Defense witness Nena Despabeladeras testified that on 
August 10, 
1996 at about 2:30 p.m. she went to the market, passing the house of 
Ester de los Santos, and she saw the accused and said Ester conversing 
and when she returned home, she passed the same route end she saw many 
people in the house of Ester de Santos but she did not inquire why there
 are so many people. 


 "On rebuttal, Ester de los Santos Brondial denied that she 
ever 
asked the accused to carry boxes of bananas and she likewise denied ever
 seeing witness Nena Despabeladeras passing near her house."
[2]







On 25 March 1998, the trial court rendered judgment convicting the 
accused; it held:



 "WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds the accused Pedro Ducta y
 
Pascual alias Peter guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape 
and sentences him to suffer an imprisonment of 
reclusion 
perpetua
 and to pay the sum of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity 
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.â
[3]







In his appeal to this Court, accused-appellant raised the following 
assignment of errors, to wit:



 â1. The trial court gravely erred in declaring that private 
complainant, Ellen delos Santos' (a.k.a. Clarita Clar in the 
Information) is a mental retardate notwithstanding the absence of 
pertinent medical and clinical examination having been conducted on the 
latter. 


 â2. Granting arguendo that private complainant is a mental 
retardate, the trial court still gravely erred in giving due weight and 
credence to the unintelligible and incoherent testimony of the former 
thereby casting grave doubt on the criminal culpability of appellant 
Pedro Ducta. 


 â3. The trial court likewise gravely erred in giving due 
weight 
and credence to the testimony of prosecution alleged eyewitness Ester 
delos Santos Brondial despite the existence of imputed ill-motive 
nurtured by the latter against appellant Pedro Ducta."
[4]







The Court finds no cogent justification for decreeing a reversal of the 
judgment rendered by the trial court.


Ester de los Santos Brondial sufficiently demonstrated in her testimony 
that her daughter, Ellen (Erlinda Clar), although already forty-three 
(43) years old at the time of the incident in question, was indeed a 
mental retardate.



 "Court: 


 "Q   Your daughter is Ellen de los Santos? 


 "A    Yes, Your Honor. 


 "Prosecutor Gabito: 


 "Q   How old is your daughter? 


 "A    43 year olds old, madam. 


 "Q   At that age, how does she behaves? 


 "A    She do not know anything, morning till afternoon, she 
just 
sat down, if you do not ask her, she does not answers and sometimes, she
 do not answers me when I asked her.  Whenever I sent her to an errand, 
her execution is not perfect. 


 "Court: 


 âQ   Did she go to school? 


 "A    She went to school but she was not able to learn, Your
 Honor. 


 "Q   What grade did she finish? 


 "A    She stayed in grade 1 for almost three years but she 
only learned how to make circles. 


 "Prosecutor Gabito: 


 "Q.  Did you say that she acts like a normal 43 years old 
lady? 


 "A    No. 


 "Q   Was she born that way? 


 "A    Yes. 


 "Court: 


 "Q   Did you consult a doctor to examine your daughter? 



 "A    Yes, Your Honor, but I cannot afford for a therapy 
because I am very poor. 


 "Q   What is the finding of that doctor? 


 "A    According to the doctor, she will not get well because
 that is already her natural condition. 


 "Q   What is that condition? 


 "A    If you let her sit down, the whole afternoon, 
sometimes, she
 dances, sing a song but she cannot perform any household 
chores."
[5]







Likewise, Dr. Ma. Humilde Janaban, the physician who conducted the 
medical examination on private complainant, declared that the latter had
 an "abnormal mental status;" she testified:



 "Q   At the time that you examined the patient, were you 
able to observe her behavior? 


 "A    Yes, madam. 


 "Atty. Hibo: 



    Your Honor, please, this witness was called to testify on the 
medical certificate and not on the behavior of the patient, she is not 
competent to testify on that.
  


 "Prosecutor Gabito: 



    That is an outward manifestation:
  


 "Court: 



    She can notice the behavior, manner of the patient. Answer.
  


 "Witness: 


 "A    The patient was noted to be having abnormal mental 
status; 
meaning, she is in the form of psychiatric patient, she was answering 
most of the time, when I would asked a question, she would smile, in 
other words, not normal as far as mental status is concerned."
[6]







The Court has already ruled once before that the state of mental 
retardation of a victim of rape can be established by evidence other 
than by the medical findings of a specialist.
[7]

  So also, in a good number of instances, the Court has said that a 
woman need not be completely deprived of reason for sexual intercourse 
by a man with her to constitute the crime of rape.  The term "deprived 
of reason" has been construed to include the feeble-minded although 
coherent and those suffering from mental deficiency or some form of 
mental disorder.
[8]



Looking at her testimony, Erlinda, despite her mental condition, was 
nevertheless able to give coherent answers, although with apparent 
difficulty, about the rape incident and to identify accused-appellant as
 being the culprit.



 "Direct Examination by Prosecutor Gabito: 





We are presenting this witness, Your Honor for the purpose of showing 
her behavior and how she will answer the questions propounded to her if 
she can discern her answers and other related matters.



 "Atty. Hibo: 



    The Court can just observe the demeanor of the witness, the victim.
  


 "Prosecutor Gabito: 



    With leave of Court.
  


 "Court: 





We have to find out whether she can answer the questions intelligently.


Proceed.



 "Prosecutor Gabito: 


 "Q   Ellen, do you know Pedro Ducta alias Peter? 


 "Atty. Hibo: 





That is already outside the purpose for which this witness is being 
presented.



 "Court: 





Make that on record.



 "Prosecutor Gabito: 



    How can we prove, Your Honor, if we will not ask the witness.
  


 "Court: 



    Answer.
  


 "Witness: 


 "A    (Witness nodding her head) 


 "Prosecutor Gabito: 


 âQ   Is he in Court? 


 âA    Yes, madam. 


 "Q   Please point him? 


 "A    He is there (witness pointing to a man inside the 
courtroom who identified himself as Pedro Ducta). 


 "Q   Why do you know him? 


 "A    Because he went up the house. 


 "Q   What did he do in your house? 


 "A    He removed his clothes. 


 "Q   After removing his clothes, what did he do? 


 "A    (witness - made a sign meaning sexual intercourse by 
placing her thumb in between her forefinger and middle finger). 



 "Q   To whom did he do this? 


 "A    I was the one (witness pointing to herself with the 
gesture she demonstrated a while ago). 


 "Q   How many times did he do this to you? 


 "A    (Witness demonstrating by raising her palm, meaning 
five). 


 "Q   What did you feel? 


 "A    I felt his penis (BOTO). 


 "Q   Where did you feel his penis? 


 "A    In my vagina (SA BULI). 


 "Q   Whose vagina was that? 


 âA    Mine, madam (witness pointing to herself).â
[9]







The Court finds it here relevant to repeat the rule that a mental 
retardate who has the ability to make her perceptions known to others is
 still a competent witness.
[10]



The imputation of ill-motive on the part of eyewitness Ester de los 
Santos Brondial against accused-appellant fell far too short from being 
said to be an established fact. Nothing significant on record could show
 that Ester entertained any previous personal grudge against 
accused-appellant.  At all events, it would be unnatural for a mother to
 subject her daughter to humiliation and disgrace
[11]
  if it were not due solely to her 
desire to see to it that justice was done.
[12]



Not to be missed was the medical finding of Dr. Janaban who conducted 
the medical examination on the victim. Dr. Janaban found multiple 
hymenal lacerations, positive erythema and abrasion on the victim's 
genitalia, as well as urethra in the internal part of her vagina, 
indicative of a recent sexual act. She testified:



 âQ   You have two findings,here, based on your physical 
examination, can you please read this to us? 


 "A    (witness reading the findings) 


 "Q   Considering this hymenal laceration, what can you tell 
us about its cause? 


 "A    It can be due to sexual intercourse. 


 "Q   Repeated, considering the multiple laceration? 



 "A    Not necessarily. 


 "Q   What about this positive erythema and abrasion, what is
 this in layman's language? 


 "A    Abrasion is Gasgas while erythema is reddening. 



 "Q   What could have caused the erythema and abrasion at the
 time you examined her? 


 "A    Due to scratches on the surface. 


 "Q   What could have caused those scratches? 


 "A    It can be due to sexual intercourse. 


 "Q   Is this urethra found in the internal part of the 
vagina? 


 "A    Yes, madam. 


 "Q   And, would you say that these abrasions, erythema were 
very recently inflicted at the time that you examined her? 


 "A    Usually, if there is urethra, it is recent. 


 "Q   How recent would it be? 


 "A    That could be hours.â
[13]







The testimony of defense witness Nena Despabiladeras that she saw 
accused-appellant and Ester, the victimâs mother, in a casual 
conversation along the roadside minutes before the alleged incident did 
not prove anything except to show, in fact, that no bad blood existed 
between accused-appellant and Ester.  Moreover, that Ester was not far 
from the scene of the crime did not make the commission of rape 
unlikely; past events would show that rapists had not been deterred from
 committing their odious act by the presence of people, nearby.
[14]



In accordance with recent jurisprudence, the Court finds that an 
additional award to the victim of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages is 
in order.



WHEREFORE,
 the decision of the court a quo,
 convicting 
accused-appellant Pedro Ducta of the crime of rape and imposing on him 
the penalty of 
reclusion perpetua
, is AFFIRMED with
 the 
MODIFICATION that, in addition to the award of civil indemnity of 
P50,000.00, he hereby is likewise ordered to pay the victim, by way of 
moral damages, the amount of P50,000.00.  Cost against 
accused-appellants.


SO ORDERED.
