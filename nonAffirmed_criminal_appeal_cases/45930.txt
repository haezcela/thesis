QUISUMBING, J.:


This appeal seeks to reverse and set aside the Court of Appeals' Resolution dated July 31, 2002,
[1]
 which dismissed petitioner's appeal; and another dated November 5, 2003,
[2]
 which denied his motion for reconsideration, in CA-G.R. SP No. 71764.  The appellate court dismissed the appeal of the petitioner on the ground of lack of compliance with Section 11,
[3]
 Rule 13, and Section 2,
[4]
 Rule 42 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure.
The case involves several complaints for violation of Sections 18,
[5]
 19,
[6]
 and 20
[7]
 of Presidential Decree No. 1519,
[8]
 as amended, for the non-deduction and non-remittance of petitioner's contributions to the Social Security System (SSS) covering the period from January 1999 to November 2000.  The complaints filed by petitioner on August 13, 2001 were docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 7479, 7483 and 7484 in the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of San Jose, Antique.  Except for the months of July and August of 1999, in which Criminal Cases Nos. 7483 and 7484 were allegedly committed, the three informations filed against Marietta E. Laguardia and Silverio "Eric" Lozana,
[9]
 for violations of Sections 18, 19, and 20 of P.D. No. 1519, are similarly worded as in Criminal Case No. 7479, as follows:
Criminal Case No. 7479
CRIMINAL COMPLAINT
(Failure to deduct and remit contributions, March 1999)
The undersigned accuses MARIETTA E. LAGUARDIA and ERIC E. LOZANA alias Silverio Lozana of violation of Sections 18, 19 and 
[20]

defrauding the undersigned complainant and the government what are due them.
CONTRARY TO LAW.

[10]
Upon order of the trial court, petitioner then filed several amended criminal complaints for violation of Sections 28
[11]
 and 44
[12]
 of Republic Act No. 7875,
[13]
 also for the non-deduction and non-remittance of petitioner's SSS and Medicare contributions covering the period from January 1999 to November 2000.  These amended complaints were likewise similarly worded except for the months these allegedly happened.  The information for Criminal Case No. 7479 was amended as follows:
Criminal Case No. 7479
AMENDED CRIMINAL COMPLAINT
(Failure to remit contributions, March 1999)
The undersigned accuses MARIETTA E. LAGUARDIA of violation of Sections 28 and 44 of Republic Act No. 7875 committed as follows:

No. 7875 and/or with the rules and regulations promulgated by Philippine Health Insurance Corporation 
in remitting employer and employee contributions to the proper government agency or instrumentality in accordance with said RA 7875 for the month of March, 1999,
 
defrauding the undersigned complainant and the government what are due them.
CONTRARY TO LAW.
San Jose, Antique, November 23, 2001.
(Sgd.) REY GARCESAComplainant
[14]
Criminal Cases Nos. 7483 and 7484 concerned the offenses allegedly committed in July 1999 and August 1999.
In response to the complaints, the respondents filed a motion to dismiss
[15]
 with the MTC.  The motion alleged that six weeks after the original complaints were filed in court, the respondents paid all the premiums required by Rep. Act No. 7875.  Thereafter, the MTC issued an Order
[16]
 dismissing the cases on the ground that there was no showing in the record that the coverage by the National Health Insurance Program had been made compulsory in the Province of Antique.
Petitioner appealed to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Jose, Antique, Branch 12.  There, the cases were docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 6563, 6567 and 6568. On May 2, 2002, the RTC rendered a Decision
[17]
 affirming the Order of dismissal of the MTC.  The RTC likewise denied the motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner.
[18]
Petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals.  There, he raised the following issues:
I.
Whether or not in 1999 and 2000 in the Province of Antique nobody could be criminally prosecuted for non-payment of Medicare contributions[.]
II.
Whether or not the lower court on any ground could dismiss an amended complaint, which it ordered to be amended[.]
III.
Whether or not a private complainant could appeal his cases without written conformity of the prosecutor[.]
[19]
Two months after, the appellate court affirmed the actions taken by the RTC.  The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' resolution reads as follows:
ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is ordered 
DISMISSED.
SO ORDERED.
[20]
According to the Court of Appeals, petitioner did not explain fully why personal service was not effected, in contravention of Section 11, Rule 13 which mandates that a resort to modes of service other than personal must be accompanied by a written explanation why the service or filing was not done personally.  It added that petitioner also failed to append the several complaints for violation of P.D. No. 1519, the several amended criminal complaints for violation of Rep. Act No. 7875, and the attachments stated in paragraph 3 of the motion to dismiss, which were all material portions of the records and relevant to the petition, in contravention of Section 2, Rule 42 which requires that the petition be accompanied by such other pleadings and material portions of the records as should support the allegations of the petition.
Likewise, on November 5, 2003, the Court of Appeals denied the motion for reconsideration.
[21]
On December 9, 2003, the petitioner filed a petition for review on certiorari before this Court.
Assigned by the petitioner as issues are the following:
I.
WHETHER OR NOT IN 1999 AND 2000 IN THE PROVINCE OF ANTIQUE NOBODY COULD BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED FOR NON-PAYMENT OF MEDICARE CONTRIBUTIONS[.]
II.
WHETHER OR NOT THE TRIAL COURT ON ANY GROUND COULD DISMISS AN AMENDED COMPLAINT, WHICH IT ORDERED TO AMEND[.]
III.
WHETHER OR NOT A PETITIONER COULD APPEAL HIS CASES WITHOUT WRITTEN CONFORMITY OF THE PROSECUTOR[.]
IV.
WHETHER OR NOT THE PETITION FILED WITH THE COURT OF APPEAL[S] CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULES OF COURT[.]
[22]
The issues for our determination are: (1) Is nonpayment of medicare contribution a criminal offense in Antique in 1999 and 2000?  (2) Did the Court of Appeals err in dismissing the petition for failure to submit the requirements of Section 11, Rule 13 and Section 2, Rule 42 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure? and (3) Is the prosecutor's conformity required for a petitioner to appeal his case?
We will tackle the procedural issues first.
On the issue of lack of explanation for non-personal service, petitioner states that the general public knows that Manila and Bacolod City are far from Antique and the far distance between the aforesaid places was the reason why resort to substituted service was made. Petitioner's explanation reads: "Copy furnished to the above-named court/persons/counsels and filed with this court by registered mail, personal service is not practical."
[23]
Respondents, on the other hand, state that there was a violation of Section 11, Rule 13, which
 
requires that resort to registered mail as a mode of service must come with an explanation why personal service was not practicable in the first place. The Court of Appeals averred that petitioner never gave the required explanation.
In 
Musa
 v. Amor
,
[24]
 which also involved the question of no personal service, we said:
... Considering the distance between the Court of Appeals and Donsol, Sorsogon where the petition was posted, clearly, service by registered mail would have entailed considerable time, effort and expense. A written explanation why service was not done personally might have been superfluous.  In any case, as the rule is so worded with the use of "may," signifying permissiveness, a violation thereof gives the court discretion whether or not to consider that paper as not filed. While it is true that procedural rules are necessary to secure an orderly and speedy administration of justice, rigid application of Section 11, Rule 13 may be relaxed in this case in the interest of substantial justice.
[25]
Conformably with the 
Musa
 v. Amor
 ruling, we hold that in the present case, there was substantial compliance. Considering the distance between the Court of Appeals and the Province of Antique where the petition was posted, a written explanation why service was not done personally might have been superfluous.  In the interest of substantial justice, a rigid application of Section 11, Rule 13 could be relaxed in this case.
Moreover, Section 6, Rule 1 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure states the following:
SEC. 6. 
Construction
. - These Rules shall be liberally construed in order to promote their objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding.
Mindful of the aforecited rule, we find the explanation of petitioner acceptable.  At least it could be conceded that petitioner apparently did not ignore the rule.
[26]
With regard to the issue of non-attachment of pleadings, petitioner states that the complaints mentioned, while not attached to the petition, were quoted in the text of the petition itself.  Respondents, however, state that there was a violation of Section 2, Rule 42, which
 
requires that the petition be accompanied by such other pleadings and material portions of the records as should support the allegations of the petition.  The Court of Appeals said that the petition did not append the several criminal complaints for violation of Rep. Act No. 7875 and the attachments stated in paragraph 3 of the motion to dismiss.
Dismissal of appeals purely on technical grounds is frowned upon.
[27]
  In the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, we may even stay an order of such kind of dismissal, especially in this case where petitioner's appeal appears worthy of the Court of Appeals' full consideration 
prima facie 
on the merits.
[28]
  Here, the Court of Appeals could have easily required the parties to submit additional documents as might have been necessary in the interest of substantial justice.
[29]
In brief, under the circumstances of this case, it was wrong for the Court of Appeals to peremptorily dismiss the petition for failure to explain why registered mail was resorted to, and for failure of the petitioner to attach to the petition other pleadings and material portions of the records.
Well established is the doctrine that every party litigant must be afforded the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from the constraints of technicalities.
[30]
Finally, on the issues of nonpayment of medicare contributions as a criminal offense and the need for the conformity of the prosecutor to appeal a case, we note that these two issues are  raised as issues before the Court of Appeals.
[31]
 We shall not preempt the appellate court on these.
WHEREFORE
, the challenged Resolutions dated July 31, 2002 and November 5, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 71764 are 
REVERSED
 and 
SET ASIDE
.  The Court of Appeals is 
DIRECTED 
to reinstate the petition and continue without delay the proceedings as the facts and the law would warrant.
No pronouncement as to costs.
SO ORDERED.
Carpio, Carpio Morales, Tinga

- Whenever practicable, the service and filing of pleadings and other papers shall be done personally.
