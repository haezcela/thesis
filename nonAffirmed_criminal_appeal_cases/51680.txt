Conrado Bautista y Diegoâs service firearm, one (1) .45 caliber pistol, to the damage and prejudice of the Heirs of said Conrado D. Bautista.
 
CONTRARY TO LAW.
[3]
 
When arraigned on August 12, 1998, accused-appellants, duly assisted by their respective counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charge, whereupon trial on the merits ensued. The prosecution presented as witnesses Galo Estipona, Jr., the bus conductor, Sabas Surio, the bus driver, Dr. Jose Arnel Marquez, the medico-legal officer, and SPO1 Primo Borito, the investigating officer. The defense, on the other hand, presented the three accused-appellants and Marissa Balena.
 
The prosecution established the following facts:
 
In the evening of July 6, 1998, a Rhine Transport bus left its terminal in Lagro, Quezon City bound for Baclaran. At around 11:30 that evening, while cruising along Commonwealth Avenue and passing by Bitoon Circle, near DoÃ±a Carmen Subdivision, five men hailed the bus. The driver, Sabas Surio, opened the automatic door and allowed the men to board. The first to board went straight to the back of the bus, one went near the driver, and another one positioned himself near Galo Estipona, Jr., the bus conductor, and the other two guarded the passengers, who numbered more or less ten. Shortly thereafter, one of them shouted, 
âHoldup ito! Walang kikilos ng masama!â
 The man near the driver poked a knife at him and ordered him to continue driving. The two persons guarding the passengers started divesting them of their valuables, while the one near the conductor poked a gun at him and grabbed the money folded in between his fingers, and those inside his pocket, and ordered him to lie down on the floor. Before Estipona was able to lie down, he saw a passenger and one of the robbers grappling on something. Thereafter, he heard several gunshots inside the bus. Five men scampered and left one of the passengers, M/Sgt. Conrado D. Bautista, lying on the floor. Surio and Estipona proceeded to the police station and reported that their dayâs collection, amounting to P7,800.00, and other valuables of the passengers were forcibly taken away by five men, that one person was killed and one woman was injured. A week later, the two were summoned to the police station at Camp Karingal to identify the robbers, after which they executed sworn statements.
 
Dr. Arnel Marquez conducted the autopsy on the body of M/Sgt. Conrado Bautista and found that he sustained six gunshot wounds on different parts of his body and two lacerated wounds on his left ear. He concluded that two of the wounds were fatal as the vital organs including the lungs, the artery of the left carotid, the left jugular vein, the thoracic aorta, the pericardial sac and the arch of the aorta were the ones hit.
 
SPO1 Primo Borito testified that one week after the incident, they arrested the accused-appellants and confiscated a .38 caliber revolver 
(paltik)
 from Raul Guimba and another .38 caliber revolver with ammunition from Delfin Rodrigo. They likewise confiscated a fragmentation grenade placed inside a black belt bag found inside the house.
 
Accused-appellants denied the accusation against them. Instead, accused-appellant Raul Guimba testified that he was a security guard of the ATU Security Agency. On July 6, 1998, at 7:00 p.m., after his duty ended, he went to Delfin Rodrigoâs house at 101, Odigal St., Litex, Quezon City, for his karate lessons. He left at 10:00 p.m. and boarded an air-conditioned bus. While he was seated in the bus, somebody declared a âholdupâ from the rear of the bus. When he stood up, he was hit by a gunshot on the stomach. Hurriedly, he alighted from the bus, boarded a taxi and proceeded to his cousinâs house. While he was there recuperating from the gunshot wound, he was arrested by the police who, according to him, had no arrest or search warrant. He further testified that the passengers of the bus who reported the incident to the police failed to identify him during the police line-up as one of the robbers.
 
For their part, accused-appellants Delfin Rodrigo and Dennis Arguelles testified that on July 6, 1998 at 10:00 in the evening, they were at the house of accused-appellant Delfin Rodrigo attending karate lessons. Rodrigo was the instructor while Guimba, Arguelles, Marissa Balena and a certain Ben were the students. Guimba left at 10:00 p.m. while the rest stayed behind. After the lesson, they decided to have a drinking spree. Balena sang while Rodrigo played the piano. They stayed there until midnight.
 
Accused-appellant Arguelles further testified that after his arrest, he was beaten up by the police officers which rendered him unconscious. Then he was dragged into a vehicle and slumped on the floor with his hands handcuffed. During the police line-up, the passengers of the bus failed to identify accused-appellants Rodrigo and Arguelles.
 
In their respective Briefs, accused-appellants raise the following errors:
 
 
I
 
THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIES OF PROSECUTION WITNESS GALO ESTIPONA AND SABAS SURIO DESPITE THEIR FAILURE TO GIVE CARTOGRAPHIC SKETCHES OF THE PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIME IMMEDIATELY RIGHT AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.
 
II
 
THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE ARRESTING OFFICER SPO1 PRIMO BORITO AND THE ALLEGED INFORMANT MIGHT HAVE MISTAKEN THE IDENTITIES OF ACCUSED RAUL GUIMBA, DELFIN RODRIGO AND DENNIS ARGUELLES.
 
III
 
THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS RAUL GUIMBA, DELFIN RODRIGO AND DENNIS ARGUELLES GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE COMPLEX CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE DEFINED AND PENALIZED UNDER PAR. 1 OF ARTICLE 294 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE, AS AMENDED BY REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7659.
 
IV
 
THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE WAS COMMITTED BY A BAND UNDER PAR. 6, ARTICLE 14 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE, AS AMENDED.
 
Accused-appellants contend that the trial court erred in giving credence to the identification made by the two prosecution witnesses, Galo Estipona, Jr. and Surio Sabas. They argue that the witnesses were not sure of the perpetratorsâ identities because when they first reported the incident to the police they were not able to give any cartographic sketch of the alleged perpetrators of the crime. Moreover, the delay in the identification by the prosecution witnesses, which was made six days after the incident, shows that the witnesses had not identified them with exactness and certainty.
 
The contention is without merit.
 
Essentially, accused-appellants now attack the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, whom the trial court had characterized as bearing all the hallmarks of credible witnesses since they testified in a categorical, straightforward and candid manner. Additionally, the trial court did not find any 
indicium
 that the prosecution witnesses falsely testified against them or were prompted by any ill-motive to make such an accusation, their only objective being to bring to justice those who were responsible therefor.
 
In view of the gravity of the crime and the penalty involved, we have meticulously reviewed the records and the transcript of stenographic notes, specifically the testimonies of the eyewitnesses, and we find no reason to set aside the trial courtâs conclusion that the prosecution witnesses identified accused-appellants as the perpetrators of the crime. Once again, we must stress that findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses deserve great weight, given the clear advantage of a trial judge in the appreciation of testimonial evidence. The trial court is in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses because of their unique opportunity to observe the witnesses first hand and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under grueling examination. These are significant factors in evaluating the sincerity of witnesses. Save for compelling reasons, we are doctrinally bound by the trial courtâs assessment of credibility of witnesses.

A.

So, you mean your face was fronting towards the back of the bus?
 
 
 
 
A.
 
No sir, at the right side. On the right side of my body, sir.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q.
 
 
Also at the right side of the bus there were vacant seats. You mean you were free to see what is happening on the back. So, you were able to see the back side as to what people were doing?
 
 
 
 
A.
 
I could not see.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q.

A.
 
 
I am sure that the two persons Dennis Arguelles and the other one who was not yet arrested they were the ones divesting the valuables in fact getting the bag of the mother and child.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q.
 
From your seat where you are leaning up to the portion where you saw Dennis Arguelles, how many seats apart?
 
 
 
 
A.
 
 
It is like this sir. I was positioned at the third seat from the driver. I was positioned on the third seat at the back of the driver and the mother and child were positioned in the second seat on the other side of the bus and I could see them clearly.
 
 
 
From the foregoing testimony it can be gleaned that the witness had every opportunity to identify some of the culprits considering that there were not many passengers on board and the cabin was adequately lighted. It is settled jurisprudence that victims of criminal violence have a penchant for remembering the faces and features of their attackers. The most natural reaction of victims of violence is to strive to see the appearance of the perpetrators of the crime and observe the manner in which the crime was committed.
[7]
 Moreover, where conditions of visibility are favorable and the witnesses did not appear to be biased against the accused, their assertions as to the identity of the malefactors should normally be accepted.
[8]
 
In the case at bar, accused-appellants failed to show that the prosecution witnesses were prompted by any ill motive to falsely testify or wrongfully accuse them of so grave a crime of robbery with homicide. The Court adheres to the established rule that in the absence of any evidence to show that the witness was actuated by any improper motive, his identification of the accused as the assailant should be given full faith and credit.
[9]
 
The fact that there was no cartographic sketch of the perpetrators made immediately after the incident does not in any way lessen the credibility of the prosecutionâs witnesses for it is neither an indispensable requirement in prosecuting the crime nor is it an element thereof. Neither would the delay in identifying the perpetrators render their testimony less plausible. We have consistently held that failure to immediately reveal the identity of the perpetrator of a felony will not necessarily impair the credibility of a witness
[10]
 if such delay is satisfactorily explained.
[11]
 True, in the case at bar, the identification of the accused-appellants took place when they were arrested after one week. However, as explained by the prosecution witnesses, they described accused-appellants immediately after the incident, which became the bases for their subsequent arrest.
[12]
 
The prosecution was able to establish the essential elements of robbery with homicide, to wit: (a) the taking of personal property with the use of violence or intimidation against a person; (b) the property belongs to another; (c) the taking is characterized with 
animo lucrandi
, and (d) by reason of the robbery or on the occasion thereof, homicide (used in its generic sense) is committed.
[13]
 
Although the prosecution witnesses did not see who among the culprits shot M/Sgt. Conrado D. Bautista, this, however, does not absolve accused-appellants from liability therefrom. The concerted manner by which accused-appellants perpetrated the crime showed beyond reasonable doubt the presence of conspiracy. Where conspiracy is established, it matters not who among the accused actually shot and killed the victim. The consistent doctrinal rule is that whenever a homicide has been committed as a consequence of or on the occasion of a robbery, all those who took part as principals in the robbery will also be held guilty as principals in the special complex crime of robbery with homicide, even if some of them did not actually take part in the homicide, unless it appears that those who did not do so endeavored to prevent the homicide.
[14]
 
We cannot, however, sustain the trial courtâs finding that the crime was attended with the aggravating circumstance of band. A crime is deemed to have been committed by band whenever more than three armed malefactors shall have acted together in the commission of an offense.
[15]
 In the case at bar, the prosecution failed to prove whether more than three of the culprits were armed. At most, only two were proved to be armed: the person who poked a knife on the driver and accused-appellant Delfin Rodrigo, who poked a gun at the conductor.
[16]
 
The imposable penalty for robbery with homicide is 
reclusion perpetua
 to death. There being neither aggravating circumstance nor mitigating circumstance in the commission of the crime, the penalty should be reduced to 
reclusion perpetua
.
[17]
 
Anent the award of damages, the trial court ordered accused-appellant to pay the heirs of the victim the stipulated amount of P90,000.00 as actual damages
[18]
 and P50,000.00 as death indemnity, and to return the amount of P7,800.00 to Rhine Transport with interest. Although receipts should ordinarily support claims for actual damages, as an exception, in 
People v. Galvez
,
[19]
 we sustained the award of actual damages in view of the defenseâs admission of the claim. However, the order of the trial court to return the amount of P7,800.00 with interest to Rhine Transport must be deleted for not being supported by evidence. Furthermore, in line with the current jurisprudence, an award of moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 to the victimâs heirs is likewise proper taking into consideration the pain and anguish of the victimâs family brought about by his death.
[20]
 
WHEREFORE
, in view of the foregoing, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 95, in Criminal Case No. Q-98-77765 finding accused-appellants Raul Guimba, Dennis Arguelles and Delfin Rodrigo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide is AFFRIMED with the MODIFICATION that accused-appellants are sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
Reclusion Perpetua
 and to pay the heirs of the victim the amounts of P90,000.00 as actual damages, P50,000.00 as death indemnity and the further sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages.
